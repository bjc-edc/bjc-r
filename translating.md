# Translating BJC

This is a guide for translating BJC content into another language.

## Overview:

Each translated version belongs in a folder with the langauge code, e.g. `es` for Spanish.

* the course HTML file goes in `course/es/`
* curriculum goes `cur/es/`
* images go in `img/es/`
* topic files go in `topic/es/`

In each of this folders we should maintain the same directory structure and filenames. **Filenames should not be translated.**

## Translating Images: TODO
