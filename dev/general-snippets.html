		<div class="comment">Aren't we going to retrofit "If There's Time" into all the units?  Also, I vote for changing "There Is" to "There's."--bh</div> 
        <p>
        	This lab also introduces a new lab page design element: "If There Is Time." This section is included to provide greater support for differentiation:
			<ul>
                <li>"For You to Do" problems should be <strong>completed by all</strong> students</li>
                <li>"If There Is Time" should be <strong>attempted by most</strong> students</li>
                <li>"Take It Further" is offered <strong>for those students who are moving most quickly</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
			The goal of this three-tiered approach is to help teachers keep all students moving through the lab pages at the same pace regardless of the pace of individual pairs.
        </p>
		<div class="todo">We should discuss next meeting, and then put in the TG Intro, a policy about whether teachers should try to match students by ability/experience within each pair, and if not, how to handle this pacing business.  And, speaking of pacing, we need to discuss and somehow fix the mythological pacing estimates throughout the course.--bh</div>
