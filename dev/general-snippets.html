		<div class="comment">Aren't we going to retrofit "If There's Time" into all the units?  Also, I vote for changing "There Is" to "There's."--bh</div> 
        <p>
        	This lab also introduces a new lab page design element: "If There Is Time." This section is included to provide greater support for differentiation:
			<ul>
                <li>"For You to Do" problems should be <strong>completed by all</strong> students</li>
                <li>"If There Is Time" should be <strong>attempted by most</strong> students</li>
                <li>"Take It Further" is offered <strong>for those students who are moving most quickly</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
			The goal of this three-tiered approach is to help teachers keep all students moving through the lab pages at the same pace regardless of the pace of individual pairs.
        </p>
		<div class="todo">We should discuss next meeting, and then put in the TG Intro, a policy about whether teachers should try to match students by ability/experience within each pair, and if not, how to handle this pacing business.  And, speaking of pacing, we need to discuss and somehow fix the mythological pacing estimates throughout the course.--bh</div>

        <div class="todo">Langauge Standards:<br />
        2.2.3B High level programming languages provide more abstractions for the programmer and make it easier for people to read and write a program.<br />
        2.2.3C Code in a programming language is often translated into code in another (lowerlevel) language to be executed on a computer.<br />
        4.1.2A Languages for algorithms include natural language, pseudocode, and visual and textual programming languages.<br />
        4.1.2D Different languages are better suited for expressing different algorithms.<br />
        <strong>EK 4.1.2E</strong> Some programming languages are designed for specific domains and are better for expressing algorithms in those domains.<br />
