		<h3>About BJC</h3>
		<p><a href="https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/" title="Beauty and Joy of Computing website: bjc.edc.org" target="_blank">Beauty and Joy of Computing</a> is a College Board-endorsed, AP CSP curriculum designed to provide students with a rigorous and engaging introduction to CS and to expand access and participation in CS for all students, with an emphasis on student groups historically underrepresented in CS. BJC uses the blocks-based programming language Snap<em>!</em>, which offers a low-threshold of entry yet a high-ceiling of powerful programming capacity. BJC provides a robust set of teacher supports as well as an active online teacher community.</p>
