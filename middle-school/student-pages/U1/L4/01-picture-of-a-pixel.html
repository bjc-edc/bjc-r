		<h2>Picture of a Pixel</h2>
		<div class="todo">Hi Pamela, I ended up adding three blocks to the XML file (<code>rgb pixel</code>, <code>draw pixel</code>, and <code>paint color from pixel</code>, which has yet to be written) and replacing the file in /prog. If you can find a reasonable way to combine my <code>draw pixel</code> with your <code>draw pixel cell</code> block and/or to reuse some of the <code>draw picture</code> code in <code>paint color from pixel</code>, that would be nice for the underlying code. I did not hide any blocks since I know you'll be editing, but once we are all done, one of us should remove the unused blocks and then hide everything except the four they will be using. Also, the new pixel stuff ended up long enough to warrant a second page, but it's all still in this XML file and before the other one, as discussed. Thank you for your help! --MF, 8/27/21 
       <br>I implemented paint color. Also adjusted draw picture to only draw the picture once (as it was wrapping around and drawing twice, I think you resized the images to take less space?). I made it so that draw pixel uses draw pixel with size, to DRY up that code. Making draw pic+paint color reuse some code would be possible, but it'd require a block with 8 parameters or something, due to the differences, so I didn't attempt it. I think current approach is more readable.
I think we should not encourage them to make white, due to the issue of it being impossible, but yellow/purple/etc fair game. May want to add a teacher note about white.-PF Sep 5

		<h3>What's a Pixel?</h3>
		<p>
			The screen you're looking at is made up of thousands, if not millions, of <em>pixels</em>. Each pixel is made up of red, green, and blue light, and the screen combines pixels with different amounts of each of those three colors to make all the different colors on a screen. Here's what a white pixel looks like up close:<br />
			<div class="vocabBig">
				<p>A <strong>pixel</strong> (short for <strong>pic</strong>ture <strong>el</strong>ement) is the smallest programmable unit of color on a screen.</p>
			</div>

		<h3>Building Pictures from Pixels</h3>
		<p>When a computer draws a picture, it's actually drawing it pixel by pixel, activating the appropriate red, green, and blue components of each pixel in the screen to replicate the picture.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>Open this <a class="js-run-v7" href="/bjc-r/middle-school/prog/picture-of-a-pixel.xml&editMode&noRun" title="Picture of a Pixel project" target="_blank">Picture of a Pixel</a> project, in which you can see for yourselves with how monitors build pictures from pixels, and save it to your Snap<em>!</em> account.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			The project has a single command block:<br />
			<div class="vocab">
				<p><strong>Resolution</strong> is the level of detail in an image.</p>
			</div>
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab04/draw-picture.png" alt="draw picture ('mystery1') with resolution: ('8')" title="draw picture ('mystery1') with resolution: ('8')" />
		</p>
		<p>The <code>draw picture</code> block takes two inputs, picture and resolution (the number of pixels wide that the resulting image will be). Both inputs are dropdown menus, so you can click them to select a different value.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>Start with the "mystery1" picture and the lowest resolution (8), and click the block. The command will paint an eight-pixel wide image of the "mystery1" picture on the stage. You probably can't recognize the picture yet.</li>
				<li>Keep increasing the resolution and clicking the block. Try setting the resolution to 16, then 24, then 32, then 48, then 64, then 96, and finally 128. At what resolution are you able to recognize the image?</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			Eventually, with enough pixels across, the picture should become quite clear.<br />
			<div class="sidenote">Click the image for an animation.</div>
			<img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/turtle-pixel-animation.gif" alt="pixelated image of a sea turtle becoming increasingly more clear. The image starts at resolution 8, then goes to 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, and finally 128." title="pixelated image of a sea turtle becoming increasingly more clear. The image starts at resolution 8, then goes to 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, and finally 128." />
		</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>
					Reset the resolution to 8 and try doing the same thing with some of the other mystery pictures. 
					<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
					<ol>
						<li>Are some of the pictures easier to guess at low resolution than others?</li>
						<li>Do you notice any patterns with the RGB (red, green, blue) contents of the pixels and how they eventually change?</li>
						<li>What do you notice about the relationship between image resolution and how long it takes for the computer to draw the image?</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned that images are made up of pixels (tiny squares with different amounts of red, green, and blue) that resolution controls the number of pixels used to make up an image.</div>
