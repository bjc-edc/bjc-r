		<h2>Picture of a Pixel</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll see how pixels can bring a picture to life.</div>

		<h3>What's a Pixel?</h3>
		<p>You're looking at some sort of computer screen right now, right? That screen is made up of thousands, if not millions, of pixels!</p>
		<p>
			Each pixel is made up of red, green, and blue light, and the screen combines them in different amounts to make different colors. Here's a pixel with all colors equally bright:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/pixel.png" alt="square made up of three horizontal rectangles each of a solid color: red, green, and blue" title="square made up of three horizontal rectangles each of a solid color: red, green, and blue" />
		</p>
		<p>Incredibly, that's the combination used to make the color white!</p>

		<h3>Building Pictures from Pixels</h3>
		<p>When a computer draws a picture, it's actually drawing it pixel by pixel, activating the appropriate red, green, and blue components of each pixel in the monitor to replicate the picture.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>Open this <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:/bjc-r/middle-school/prog/picture-of-a-pixel.xml&editMode&noRun" title="Picture of a Pixel project" target="_blank">Picture of a Pixel</a> project, in which you can see for yourselves with how monitors build pictures from pixels.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			The project has a single command block:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/draw-picture.png" alt="draw picture ('mystery1') with resolution: ('8')" title="draw picture ('mystery1') with resolution: ('8')" />
		</p>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>Michael, why are <var>var tags</var> in italics now? --MF, 8/13/21</p>
		</div>
		<p>The <code>draw picture</code> block takes two inputs, <var>picture</var> and <var>resolution</var> (the number of pixels across). Both inputs are dropdowns, so you can easily change their values.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>Start with the first picture and  the low resolution of 8, and click the block. The command will paint the picture on the stage, but only use 8 pixels in each row. Can you recognize the picture at this point? Does it look anything like a normal picture?</li>
				<li>Keep increasing the resolution and clicking the block. Try to guess the contents of the picture and keep track of when you guess it correctly.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Eventually, with enough pixels across, the picture should become quite clear.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<div class="todo">Can we devise any way that students won't just automatically go to the highest resolution--a slider perhaps? Hmm... --MF, 8/13/21<br>I don't see a great way, thus am recommending as teacher-led in teacher guide. -PF
			</div>
			<ol start="5">
				<li>Try doing the same with other mystery pictures by changing the input to the <var>picture</var> input slot. Are some of them easier to guess at low resolution than others? Do you notice any patterns with the RGB (red, green, blue) contents of the pixels and how they eventually change?</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned that images are made up of pixels that are tiny squares with different amounts of red, green, and blue.</div>
