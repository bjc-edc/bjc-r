		<h2>Viewing and Storing Pixels</h2>
		<div class="todo">I have not gone back through these next two activities since we talked this morning, so I'm not year ready for your future XML edits here. --MF, 8/27/21</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll get a close-up look at the pixels in an image, see how the pixels are stored, and access data about the pixels.</div>
		<p>As you've discovered, the images on a screen are made up of pixels (tiny squares of color). That's also how images are stored. Using a few powerful blocks, you can transform the pixels in a picture to make fun filters.</p>
		
		<h3>Checking Out Some Pixels</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Open the <a class="js-run-v7" href="/bjc-r/middle-school/prog/image-manipulation.xml&editMode&noRun" title="Image Manipulation project" target="_blank">Image Manipulation</a> project and save it to your Snap<em>!</em> account.</li>
				<li>
					This <code>use costume</code> block switches the <em>sprite costume</em> (the image shown on the stage) and resizes it. Choose a costume from the dropdown menu, and click the block. Try a few different costumes until you find one you like.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/use-costume-parrots.png" alt="use costume ('parrots')" title="use costume ('parrots')" />
				</li>
				<div class="comment">All images used as costumes were either taken by Pamela or from Pixabay and appear to be public domain.</div>
				<li>
					Now move your mouse over the image to the stage where the image appears. A pixel grid will pop up in the top left corner, showing you the pixel under your cursor plus the pixels around it (zoomed in). Explore the image with your mouse pointer. Do any of the pixels surprise you?<br />
					<div class="sidenoteBig">
						<p>The first three RGB values shown are the amount of red, green, and blue in the pixel under the mouse pointer. The fourth RGB value is the opacity (the opposite of transparency). None of the pixels in these images are transparent, so the opacity of every pixel is at the highest possible value, 255.</p>
						<p>The XY values are the horizontal (<em>x</em>) and vertical (<em>y</em>) positions of the mouse pointer.</p>
						<!--<p>Pixel Number identifies which pixel in the image you are looking at. The pixels are numbered starting from the top left corner, going across the first row of pixels, and then moving down to each of the next rows.</p>-->
					</div>

In the upper left corner there is an 8 by 8 grid of squares of various colors representing a zoomed in portion of the parrot picture. Below the grid are two lines of text: 'RGB:144,150,33,255' and 'XY: 108,24'" title="image of Snap! stage with a photo of two colorful parrots in the bottom right corner.

				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Sprites</strong> and <strong>Costumes</strong>
			<p>
				A <strong>sprite</strong> is an object that has scripts and a costume and can even move around on the stage.
				<div class="endnote">This project has two sprites: the Image sprite (in the center), and the PixelGrid sprite (in the top left). The Image sprite has all the code you'll be playing with, and the PixelGrid sprite has all the code it needs to render the pixels.</div>
			</p>
			<p>
				A <strong>costume</strong> is picture that can be "worn" by a sprite.
				<div class="endnote">Each sprite has a current costume and a list of possible costumes. When you clicked the <code>use costume</code> block, that switched the sprite's current costume to the costume you selected. In the future, when you use Snap to make more complex projects like games, you will likely use many sprites with different costumes to represent different objects.</div>
			</p>
		</div>
		
		
		<h3>Try Your Own Image</h3>
		<p>This is optional, for anyone who has access to a webcam or your own photo.</p>
		<div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="4">
				<div class="comment">Does it raise privacy issues for UCB if we have students saving photos of themselves in Snap? --MF, 8/14/21</div>
				<li>
					Click the "Costumes" tab between the "Scripts" and "Sounds" tabs.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/costumes-tab.png" alt="image of zoomed in portion of Snap! window near the center top showing the three tabs above the Scripts area, labeled: 'Scripts,' 'Costumes,' and 'Sounds'" title="image of zoomed in portion of Snap! window near the center top showing the three tabs above the Scripts area, labeled: 'Scripts,' 'Costumes,' and 'Sounds'" />
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If you have a webcam, click the camera icon (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/camera.png" alt="camera button" title="camera button" />). The browser may ask you for permission and then give you a way to snap a photo. Say cheese! Alternatively, if you have a photo on your computer, drag it into the tab.</p>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/camera-allow.png" alt="screenshot of browser message requesting camera access for snap.berkeley.edu. Click 'Allow.'" title="screenshot of browser message requesting camera access for snap.berkeley.edu. Click 'Allow.'" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/camera-pamela.png" alt="camera snapshot of a person making a silly face" title="camera snapshot of a person making a silly face" />
				</li>
				<li>You can right click on the new costume to rename it.</li>
				<li>Now you can go back to the Scripts tab and select the new costume in the <code>use costume</code> block and inspect its pixels. Perhaps you'll discover your eye color isn't exactly "blue", "green", "brown", or "gray" in this picture. ðŸ˜‰</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
			
		<h3>How Are Pixels Stored?</h3>
		<p>Computers store pixels as a <em>list</em> of RGB values and whole images as a <em>table</em> of pixels (a list of lists).</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="8">
				<li>
					Click the <code>pixels of costume</code> block. It reports, a (very long) <em>table</em> of pixel values. Each row is one pixel in the image and the three columns show the amount of red, green, and blue (in that order) in each pixel.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/pixels-of-costume-reporting.png" alt="'pixels of costume (current)' reporting a table with 3 columns and 5 visible rows. (There is a row count of 13,104 in the upper left corner; not all rows are visible). The first column includes values ranging from 220-224; the second column includes values ranging from 220-224; the third column includes values ranging from 228-232." title="'pixels of costume (current)' reporting a table with 3 columns and 5 visible rows. (There is a row count of 13,104 in the upper left corner; not all rows are visible). The first column includes values ranging from 220-224; the second column includes values ranging from 220-224; the third column includes values ranging from 228-232." />
				</li>
				<div class="todo"><strong>Pamela</strong>, could you please add a third line of data under the PixelGrid to list the "Pixel Number"? That would make this <code>item of</code> expression much more meaningful. And would it be possible to put a black border around *the* pixel in the grid (or indicate which one is being described in some other way)? And if we are going to drop opacity, can you drop that value from the label? Also, could you make a <code>draw pixel</code> block that takes an RGB value an input and drops a big pixel on the screen? Thanks! --MF, 8/26/21
					<p>Other XML tasks for Mary: XML needs to be re-saved with "current" as the selected input to <code>pixels of costume</code>; <code>pixels of costume</code> block needs to actually use the input rather than the current costume; remove all opacity stuff. --MF, 8/25/21</p>
					<p>I want to spend some time abstracting away some of the stuff here so they can just focus on... --MF, 8/26/21</p>
				</div>
				<li>
					The expression below reports the very first pixel from the table. Click it to see a <em>list</em> of the RGB values for the very first pixel in the costume (the pixel in the top left corner).<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/item1-of-pixels.png" alt="item (1) of (pixels of costume ('current')) reporting {220, 220, 228}" title="item (1) of (pixels of costume ('current')) reporting {220, 220, 228}" />
				</li>
				<li>Change the first input to <code>item of</code> (the number) to see the RGB values of a different pixel in the image. <!--Find that pixel in the image on the stage and check that the values are the same. --></li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Lists</strong> and <strong>Tables</strong>
			<p>
				A <strong>list</strong> is an ordered sequence of items. 
				<div class="endnote">The output of the <code>item (1) of (pixels of costume ('current'))</code> expression was a list of three values: the amount of red, green, and blue in the first pixel of the costume.</div>
			</p>
			<p>
				A <strong>table</strong> is a list of lists. Each row in a table is  another  smaller list inside the  list of lists.
				<div class="endnote">
					<p>The output of the <code>pixels of costume</code> block was a table with three columns. Each row is one pixel (with red, green, and blue values), so the three columns in the table are the red, green, and blue values for all the pixels in the image.</p>
					<a href="#hint-table" data-toggle="collapse" title="instructions for viewing a table as a list of lists">Click for instructions for viewing a table as a list of lists.</a>
					<div id="hint-table" class="collapse">
						<p>Click the <code>pixels of costume</code> block, and then right-click the table that appears and select "list view...". You will see the exact same data displayed as a list of lists. (You can right-click the over-arching list and select "table view..." to go back to table view.)</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="todo">I think we have to address input and output somewhere around here. --MF, 8/27/21</div>
		<div class="todo">I'm not sure where the following (and what I want to add to it) goes. I want students to explore all the functions they will map with before them map with them. Maybe it just goes on the next page right before they map each function... --MF, 8/27/21</div>


		<h3>Selecting a Single Color</h3>
		<p>You can use code to access information about one color of a pixel.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="11">
				<li>
					The <code>color from pixel</code> block reports a single color value from the input pixel. Click the following expression, then change the color input, and then click it again. The outputs should be the items from the list that was reported by <code>item (1) of (pixels of costume ('current'))</code>.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/color-red-from-pixel.png" alt="color 'red' from pixel (item 1 of (pixels of costume 'current')" title="color 'red' from pixel (item 1 of (pixels of costume 'current')" />
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="12">
				<li>The <code>color from pixel</code> block uses the <code>item of</code> block to select the right item. To see how it works, right-click <code>color from pixel</code>, and select "editâ€¦".</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
			<div class="todo">
				I'd like to add in a chance for them to play with the RGB values for just one pixel here. They can build this instruction by grabbing the blocks from the palette and then try a few different RGB values. This offers practice with code-building, which they aren't doing much in this lab otherwise, and lists, and most importantly preps for when I want to use the <code>draw pixel</code> block on the next pages as a one-pixel segue into mapping channel edits over an image. --MF, 8/27/21<br />
				I also want them to have a chance to explore making colors by assigning RGB values. <strong>Pamela</strong>, can you help me make a <code>draw color with pixel () at resolution ()</code> block? --MF, 8/27/21
			</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned about sprites and costumes, learned how pixels are stored as lists of color values and images are stored as tables (lists of lists), and learned how to select a single pixel out of an image or and a single color value out of a pixel.</div>
