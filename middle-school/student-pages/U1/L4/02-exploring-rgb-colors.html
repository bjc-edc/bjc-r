		<h2>Exploring RGB Colors</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll explore how RGB color values create colors.</div>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em> and open your "Pixel Display" project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu.</li>
				<li>Find the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab04/rgb-pixel.png" alt="RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255)" title="RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255)" /> block in the palette, drag it into the scripting area, and click the block to run it. The <code>RGB pixel</code> block takes three numbers as input and reports a <em>list</em> with the those three color values.</li>
				<div class="vocabFullWidth">
					<p>A <strong>list</strong> is an ordered sequence of items.</p>
					<div class="endnote">
						<p>
							You've seen a list before when you selected random items from lists in the Super Short Story project:<br />

							The output of <code>random job</code> was a random item from the list of jobs.
						</p>
						<p>The output of <code>RGB pixel</code> is a list of three values: the amount of red, green, and blue for one pixel.</p>

					The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab04/draw-pixel.png" alt="draw pixel 'list input slot'" title="draw pixel 'list input slot'" /> block takes a list of RGB values as input and draws on the stage a pixel with those values. Find the <code>draw pixel</code> block in the palette, drag it into the scripting area, snap the <code>RGB pixel</code> block into the open input slot, and run it to draw a pixel with those color values.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab04/draw-pixel-rgb-85-170-255.png" alt="draw pixel (RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255))" title="draw pixel (RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255))" /> 
				</li>
				<li>
					RGB pixels have integer color values from 0 to 255. Experiment with the input values to the <code>RGB pixel</code> block inside <code>draw pixel</code>, and see how it changes the pixel drawn on the stage.<br />
					<div class="sidenote">Click the image for an animation.</div>

As the animation progresses, the three rectangles vary in darkness but each one remains a shade of its original color." title="animation of a square made up of three horizontal rectangles each of a solid color: red, green, and blue. As the animation progresses, the three rectangles vary in darkness but each one remains a shade of its original color." />
				</li>
				<li>
					The <code>paint color from pixel</code> block takes two inputs, a list of RGB color values and a resolution, and it paints a grid of pixels on the stage with those color values at that resolution. Find the <code>paint color from pixel</code> block, and build and run this script.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab04/paint-color-from-pixel-rgb-pixel.png" alt="paint color from pixel (RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255))" title="paint color from pixel (RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255))" /><br />
				</li>
				<li>Keep increasing the resolution and clicking the script. At what resolution do you start seeing a single color?</li>
				<li>
					Experiment with the input values to the <code>RGB pixel</code> block inside <code>paint color from pixel</code>.
					<ol>
					    <li>Try to get a purplish color.</li>
						<li>What RGB color values give you black?</li>
						<li>How can you get white?</li>

			<h4><strong>Why do RGB colors mix differently than paint?</strong></h4>
			<p>You might be familiar with <em>subtractive</em> color mixing where the primary colors are red, yellow, and blue and you can get secondary colors by mixing red and yellow to make orange, yellow and blue to make green, and red and blue to make purple. Mixing paints is subtractive color mixing, but mixing light (like the images on a screen) is <em>additive</em> color mixing. In additive color mixing, the primaries are red, green, and blue, and the secondary colors you get by mixing equal parts of the primaries are yellow, cyan, and magenta.</p>
			<p>Additive color mixing (like on a screen) is called <em>additive</em> because you start with no light and <em>add</em> light to get colors. Subtractive color mixing (like with paint) is called <em>subtractive</em> because you start with white light (which includes all the colors), and the paint <em>absorbs</em> (takes away) all the colors except the one reflected back to your eye.  (For example, when white light hits red paint, all colors are absorbed except red.)</p>
