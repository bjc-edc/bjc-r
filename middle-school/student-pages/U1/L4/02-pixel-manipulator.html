		<h2>Pixel Manipulator</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll filter a picture by manipulating its pixels.</div>
		<p>As you just discovered, the visual display on a computer or phone is made up of pixels (tiny squares of color), and that's also how images are stored. Using a few powerful blocks, you can transform the pixels in a picture to make fun filters.</p>
		
		<h3>Checking Out Some Pixels</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Open the <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:/bjc-r/middle-school/prog/image-manipulation.xml&editMode&noRun" title="Image Manipulation project" target="_blank">Image Manipulation</a> project and save it to your Snap<em>!</em> account.</li>
				<li>
					Choose an option in the <code>use costume</code> block and click the block. Try a few different options until you find one you like.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/use-costume-parrots.png" alt="use costume ('parrots')" title="use costume ('parrots')" />
				</li>
				<div class="comment">All images used as costumes were either taken by Pamela or from Pixabay and appear to be public domain.</div>
				<li>
					Now move your mouse over the image on the stage. A pixel grid will pop up in the top left corner, showing you the pixel under your cursor plus the pixels around it. Do any of the pixels surprise you?<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/pixel-grid-stage.png" alt="image of Snap! stage with a photo of two colorful parrots in the bottom right corner. In the upper left corner there is an 8 by 8 grid of squares of various colors representing a zoomed in portion of the parrot picture. Below the grid are two lines of text: 'RGB:144,150,33,255' and 'XY: 108,24'" title="image of Snap! stage with a photo of two colorful parrots in the bottom right corner. In the upper left corner there is an 8 by 8 grid of squares of various colors representing a zoomed in portion of the parrot picture. Below the grid are two lines of text: 'RGB:144,150,33,255' and 'XY: 108,24'" />
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		
		<h3>Try Your Own Image</h3>
		<p>This is optional, for anyone who has access to a webcam or your own photo.</p>
		<div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>
					Click the <em>Costumes</em> tab. That's next to the Scripts tab, where you write programs.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/costumes-tab.png" alt="image of zoomed in portion of Snap! window near the center top showing the three tabs above the Scripts area, labeled: 'Scripts,' 'Costumes,' and 'Sounds'" title="image of zoomed in portion of Snap! window near the center top showing the three tabs above the Scripts area, labeled: 'Scripts,' 'Costumes,' and 'Sounds'" />
				</li>
				<div class="todo">Does it raise privacy issues for UCB if we have students saving photos of themselves in Snap? --MF, 8/14/21</div>
				<li>
					<p>If you have a webcam, click the camera icon. The browser will ask you for permission and then give you a way to snap a photo. Say cheese!</p>
					<p>Alternatively, if you have a photo on your computer, drag it into the tab.</p>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/camera-allow.png" alt="screenshot of browser message requesting camera access for snap.berkeley.edu. Click 'Allow.'" title="screenshot of browser message requesting camera access for snap.berkeley.edu. Click 'Allow.'" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/camera-pamela.png" alt="camera snapshot of a person making a silly face" title="camera snapshot of a person making a silly face" />
				</li>
				<li>You can right click on the new costume to rename it.</li>
				<li>Now you can go back to the Scripts tab and select the new costume and inspect its pixels. Perhaps you'll discover your eye color isn't exactly "blue", "green", "brown", or "gray". ðŸ˜‰</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Sprites</strong> and <strong>Costumes</strong>
			<p>This is the first time you're playing with a Snap<em>!</em> project that uses sprites and costumes.</p>
			<p>A <strong>sprite</strong> is an object that has scripts and a costume. This project has two sprites: the Image sprite (in the center), and the PixelGrid sprite (in the top left). The Image sprite has all the code you'll be playing with, and the PixelGrid sprite has all the code it needs to render the pixels.</p>
			<p>Each sprite has a current <strong>costume</strong> and a list of possible costumes. When you clicked the use costume block, that switched the sprite's current costume to the selected costume. Going forward, you'll be changing the sprite's costume a lot!</p>
			<p>In the future, when you use Snap to make more complex projects like games, you will likely use many sprites to represent different objects.</p>
		</div>
		
		
		<h3>How Are Pixels Stored?</h3>
		<p>Now that you've seen the pixels with your own human eyes, let's see how the computer stores the pixels.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="8">
				<li>Click the <code>my costume</code> block. It's a simple block that reports back the current costume. That block will be used a lot in this program.</li>
				<div class="comment">Pamela, you had a comment to be about transparency vs. opacity. Could we just leave out that column?? --MF, 8/14/21</div>
				<li>
					Click the <code>pixels of costume</code> block. The comment above the block describes what it reports, a very long table of pixel values, with red in the first column, green in the second column, blue in the third column, and opacity in the fourth column.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/image-manipulation-table.png" alt="table with 4 columns and 8 rows showing, though there is a row count of 15,552 in the upper left corner (not all rows are visible). The first column includes values ranging from 182-187; the second column includes values ranging from 173-180; the third column includes values ranging from 164-171; and the fourth column has the same value of 255 in each row." title="table with 4 columns and 8 rows showing, though there is a row count of 15,552 in the upper left corner (not all rows are visible). The first column includes values ranging from 182-187; the second column includes values ranging from 173-180; the third column includes values ranging from 164-171; and the fourth column has the same value of 255 in each row." />
				</li>
				<li>
					Click the expression that looks like this:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/image-manipulation-map-expression.png" alt="map (color ('red') from pixel 'list input slot') over (('pixels') of costume (my ('costume'))))" title="map (color ('red') from pixel 'list input slot') over (('pixels') of costume (my ('costume'))))" />
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			That block turns the pixels table into a single list of just the red values. Put another way, it keeps just the first column from that table:<br />
			<div class="todo">
				<p>Is <em>keep</em> a risky word to use here? --MF, 8/14/21</p>
				<p>I wonder if it would be a better preview of <code>map</code> to understand what <code>color from pixel</code> does first... --MF, 8/14/21</p>
			</div>
			<div style="white-space: nowrap;">

			</div>
		</p>
		
		
		<h3>Playing with Filters</h3>
		<p>You have everything needed to manipulate the image. The magic begins!</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="11">
				<li>
					<div class="todo">
						<p>The next 4 scripts need alt/title text because I ran out of steam. ;) --MF, 8/14/21</p>
						<p>Also, my recent script pics are bigger than ever even though I'm following the same steps. Need to ask Michael and/or Brian about that. --MF, 8/14/21</p>
					</div>
					Click the script under the "Filter #1" comment. If it's not using your favorite costume, you can change the costume in the <code>use costume</code> dropdown menu.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/image-manipulation-filter-1.png" alt="" title="" />
				</li>
				<li>
					Filter #1 creates a new costume which contains only the red pixels from the costume, setting the green and blue to zero. Mouse over the result to verify that indeed, there are no pixels with any red or green in them.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/camera-pamela-red.png" alt="image of Snap! stage with and all-red photo of a person making a silly face. In the upper left corner there is an 8 by 8 grid of squares of various shades of red representing a zoomed in portion of the red photo. Below the grid are two lines of text: 'RGB:164,0,0,255' and 'XY: 95,35'" title="image of Snap! stage with and all-red photo of a person making a silly face. In the upper left corner there is an 8 by 8 grid of squares of various shades of red representing a zoomed in portion of the red photo. Below the grid are two lines of text: 'RGB:164,0,0,255' and 'XY: 95,35'" />
					<ul>
						<li>If an area of the image is black, what does that mean about the original color?</li>
						<li>What image would turn completely black with this filter?</li>
						<li>What happens if you change both dropdowns from "red" to "green" in the script?</li>
						<li>What if you only change one to "green" and the other to "red"? Try different combos!</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Click the script under the "Filter #2 comment", changing the costume first if you'd like. (If you don't, it will apply the filter to the result of the last filter, which could be fun!)<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/image-manipulation-filter-2.png" alt="" title="" />
				</li>
				<li>Filter #2 switches up the red, green, and blue pixels. Try it on the rainbow flags for the most obvious transformation. <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> How else could you swap them around? You can drag out the color from pixel blocks and drag them back in a different order to see what happens.</li>
				<li>
					Click the script under the "Filter #3 comment", changing the costume first if you'd like.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/image-manipulation-filter-3.png" alt="" title="" />
				</li>
				<li>
					Filter #3 brightens the whole image by increasing the red, green, and blue values (bringing them closer to white- 255,255,255). However, it doesn't increase the red quite as much (multiplying by 1.25 instead of 1.3), so it takes some red out of the picture. Try changing the multiplied values.
					<ul>
						<li>Can you make the image even brighter?</li>
						<li>Can you make the image much darker?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Click the script under the "Filter #4: Posterize" comment, changing the costume first as desired.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/image-manipulation-filter-4.png" alt="" title="" />
				</li>
				<li>
					Filter #4 (posterization) simplifies the colors in an image. If a pixel's red is greater than the red cutoff, then it's rounded up to 255, otherwise it's rounded down to 0. The same happens for the green and blue cutoffs. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
					<ul>
					    <li>What happens when you change the red cutoff? Does it become more or less red?</li>
						<li>What about if you set a cutoff all the way up to 255? Or all the way down to 0?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you zoomed in on an image to see its pixels, saw a list of the values for each pixel in an image, and explored several filters that transformed each pixel in the image.</div>
