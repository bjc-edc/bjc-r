		<h2>Pixel Mapper</h2>
		<div class="todo">In the future, we would have a histogram/pictograph showing how much red, green, and blue is in the image, building on 1.3. Thoughts? --MF, 8/26/21</div>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll apply a function to every pixel in an image and use that same process to filter a image by manipulating each of its pixels.</div>

		<h3>Mapping over a List</h3>
		<p>You can use the <code>map</code> block to apply a block that works on one list item to all the items in a list.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em> and open your "Image Manipulation" project.</li>
				<li>
					Click the following expression, which uses <code>map</code> to apply <code>color from pixel</code> to every pixel in the <code>pixels of costume</code> list.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/image-manipulation-map-expression.png" alt="map (color ('red') from pixel 'list input slot') over (('pixels') of costume (my ('costume'))))" title="map (color ('red') from pixel 'list input slot') over (('pixels') of costume (my ('costume'))))" />
				</li>
				<li>Compare the output of the <code>map</code> expression to the output of <code>pixels of costume</code>.</li>
				<li>Change the input color in the <code>color from pixel</code> block, and compare to <code>pixels of costume</code> again.</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />What does this <code>map</code> expression do?

							<p>Since <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/color-from-pixel.png" alt="color (red) from pixel 'list input slot'" title="color (red) from pixel 'list input slot'" /> reports a single color value from the input pixel (in this case, the red value), the expression <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/image-manipulation-map-expression.png" alt="map (color ('red') from pixel 'list input slot') over (('pixels') of costume (my ('costume'))))" title="map (color ('red') from pixel 'list input slot') over (('pixels') of costume (my ('costume'))))" /> reports a single color value <em>from each pixel</em> in the <code>pixels of costume</code> list (in this case, the red value of each pixel).</p>

		<h3>Playing with Filters</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>
					<div class="todo">
						<p>The next 4 scripts need alt/title text because I ran out of steam. ;) --MF, 8/14/21</p>
						<p>Also, my recent script pics are bigger than ever even though I'm following the same steps. Need to ask Michael and/or Brian about that. --MF, 8/14/21</p>
					</div>
					Click the script under the "Filter #1" comment. If it's not using your favorite costume, you can change the costume in the <code>use costume</code> dropdown menu.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/image-manipulation-filter-1.png" alt="" title="" />
				</li>
				<li>
					Filter #1 creates a new costume which contains only the red pixels from the costume, setting the green and blue to zero. Mouse over the result to verify that indeed, there are no pixels with any red or green in them.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/camera-pamela-red.png" alt="image of Snap! stage with and all-red photo of a person making a silly face. In the upper left corner there is an 8 by 8 grid of squares of various shades of red representing a zoomed in portion of the red photo. Below the grid are two lines of text: 'RGB:164,0,0,255' and 'XY: 95,35'" title="image of Snap! stage with and all-red photo of a person making a silly face. In the upper left corner there is an 8 by 8 grid of squares of various shades of red representing a zoomed in portion of the red photo. Below the grid are two lines of text: 'RGB:164,0,0,255' and 'XY: 95,35'" />
					<ul>
						<li>If an area of the image is black, what does that mean about the original color?</li>
						<li>What image would turn completely black with this filter?</li>
						<li>What happens if you change both dropdowns from "red" to "green" in the script?</li>
						<li>What if you only change one to "green" and the other to "red"? Try different combos!</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Click the script under the "Filter #2 comment", changing the costume first if you'd like. (If you don't, it will apply the filter to the result of the last filter, which could be fun!)<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/image-manipulation-filter-2.png" alt="" title="" />
				</li>
				<li>Filter #2 switches up the red, green, and blue pixels. Try it on the rainbow flags for the most obvious transformation. <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> How else could you swap them around? You can drag out the color from pixel blocks and drag them back in a different order to see what happens.</li>
				<li>
					Click the script under the "Filter #3 comment", changing the costume first if you'd like.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/image-manipulation-filter-3.png" alt="" title="" />
				</li>
				<li>
					Filter #3 brightens the whole image by increasing the red, green, and blue values (bringing them closer to white- 255,255,255). However, it doesn't increase the red quite as much (multiplying by 1.25 instead of 1.3), so it takes some red out of the picture. Try changing the multiplied values.
					<ul>
						<li>Can you make the image even brighter?</li>
						<li>Can you make the image much darker?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Click the script under the "Filter #4: Posterize" comment, changing the costume first as desired.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/image-manipulation-filter-4.png" alt="" title="" />
				</li>
				<li>
					Filter #4 (posterization) simplifies the colors in an image. If a pixel's red is greater than the red cutoff, then it's rounded up to 255, otherwise it's rounded down to 0. The same happens for the green and blue cutoffs. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
					<ul>
					    <li>What happens when you change the red cutoff? Does it become more or less red?</li>
						<li>What about if you set a cutoff all the way up to 255? Or all the way down to 0?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned how to apply a function to every element of a list using <code>map</code> and used <code>map</code> to explore several filters that transformed each pixel in the image.</div>
