		<h2>Secret Messages</h2>
		<div class="todo">"Apply multiple methods of encryption to model the secure transmission of information. 
  Encryption can be as simple as letter substitution or as complicated as modern methods used to secure networks and the Internet. Students should encode and decode messages using a variety of encryption methods, and they should understand the different levels of complexity used to hide or secure information. For example, students could secure messages using methods such as Caesar cyphers or steganography (i.e., hiding messages inside a picture or other data). They can also model more complicated methods, such as public key encryption, through unplugged activities.

        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will learn about security risks on the Internet and how data can be encoded to protect it.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will experiment with different ways of encoding and decoding a message and learn a simple method of symmetric encryption.</p>
        </div>
		<p>Messages sent across the Internet need to be secure so that they can't be read by computers along the way.</p>

				<li><strong>Decryption</strong> is the process of decoding data. </li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>There are many ways to encrypt information...</p> 
		
		<div class="ifTime">
            <ol>
                <li>Write a secret message, invent some way of encoding the message, and then give the encoded message to someone else.</li>
                <li>Try to decode the message you receive. What strategies are you using to decode it?</li>
                <li>With other students, compare the methods you used to encode your messages. Was anyone able to decode the message they received? If so, how?</li>
				<li>If anyone wasn't able to decode the message they received, discuss how to decode that message and then let them decode it.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
		
		<h3>Caesar Cipher</h3>
		<p>
			One way to encode a message is with a <em>Caesar cipher</em> (named for Julius Caesar), which is also know as a <em>shift cipher</em>. To <em>encode</em> a message with a Caesar cipher:
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
    			<li>Write out the alphabet. Then write it again just below, but start with the A under a different letter and wrap around to the beginning when you reach the end. For example, this is a shift of 3:
					<div class="indent fixedwidth">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</div>
					<div class="indent fixedwidth">DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC<img class="noshadow nopad" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/this-is-the-key.jpg" alt="This is the key." title="This is the key." /></div>
				</li>
				<li>For each letter in your secret message, find the letter in the top row, and then write down the letter below it.</li>
			</ol>
        </p>
		<p>To <em>decode</em> a message: find each letter from the coded message in the second row (in the key) and write down the letter above it.</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>
					Decode this message using the Caesar cipher shown above:<br/>
					<div class="indent fixedwidth">FDHVDU'V PHVVDJHV ZHUHQ'W YHUB VHFXUH.</div>
					<div class="todo">CAESAR'S MESSAGES WEREN'T VERY SECURE.</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					The following message was also encoded using a Caesar cipher but with a shift of 11 instead of a shift of 3. Write out a key for messages with a shift of 11, and decode this message:<br/>
					<div class="indent fixedwidth">SZH NZFWO JZF XLVP L MPEEPC NTASPC?</div>
					<div class="todo">HOW COULD YOU MAKE A BETTER CIPHER?</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="7">
				<li>
					This message was also made with a Caesar cipher. Can you decode it?<br/>
					<div class="indent fixedwidth">PIAWLTY EZ JZFC NWLDDXLEPD SZH JZF OPNZOPO ESTD XPDDLRP.
					</div>
					<div class="todo">EXPLAIN TO YOUR CLASSMATES HOW YOU DECODED THIS MESSAGE.</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="8">
				<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
				<li>Discuss how to decode a Caesar cipher <em>even if you don't know the shift</em>.</li>
				<li>How could you encode a message more securely?</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	
		<h3>Other Simple Substitution Ciphers</h3>
		<p>
            The Caesar cipher is one kind of <em>simple substitution cipher</em> that is particularly easy to encode and decode. But simple substitution ciphers don't have to substitute letters in order. Here is a more secure example of a substitution cipher:
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</div>
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">PQVFUBZOTHWYELIXRNAMGDSCKJ<img class="noshadow nopad" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/this-is-the-key.jpg" alt="This is the key." title="This is the key." /></div>
        </p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="10">
				<li>
					Decode this message using the simple substitution cipher shown just above:<br/>
					<div class="indent fixedwidth">VTXOUNA PNU UPAK MI VNPVW.</div>
					<div class="todo">CIPHERS ARE EASY TO CRACK.</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	
		<div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="11">
                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
				<li>If you intercepted a message that was created with a simple substitution cipher, how might you decode it without knowing the key?</li>
                <li>What are some ways the sender and receiver could make the encryption more secure than a simple substitution cipher?</li>
			</ol>
