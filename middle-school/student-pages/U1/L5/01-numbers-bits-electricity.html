Solutions

Storing decimals as bits

Can you find a number that's the same in decimal and binary? 
0 and 1 are the only numbers that are the same.

Can you get a result that's all 1s? 

Every decimal that is one less than a power of 2 is all 1s.
1 = 1 (same as 2 - 1)
3 = 11 (same as 4 - 1)
7 = 111 (same as 8 - 1)
etc. 

That's because powers of 2 are always 1 followed by a bunch of zeros, so the number before is 111. It's analogous to 9, 99, 999 - the number that is all 9s is always one less than the power of 10.

Can you get a result that's 11110000?

The really easy way is to type "11110000 in decimal" in Google, and it will calculate it for you! 

However, this is how we'd manually calculate it.

First, write out the powers of 2 under each bit in the number:

1
1
1
1
0
0
0
0
128
64
32
16
8
4
2
1


Then add up the powers that have a 1 in the place.
128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240

Storing bits as electricity

What decimal numbers result in no capacitors charged at all?

Only the decimal number 0 results in no capacitors charged. Every other number would need at least one capacitor charged.

What decimal numbers make all the capacitors light up with charge?

This is the same as the question about making numbers with all 1s from the previous section. Any decimal number that's a power of 2 minus 1 will result in a row of charged capacitors.

What's a decimal number that charges every capacitor but one?

There are lots of numbers that can answer this question!
Some early ones: 

Decimal
Binary
2
10
5
101
6
110


There's not a pattern to all the answers, so students can play with different decimal values until they find ones with a matching capacitor pattern, or they can write our binary sequences with only one 0 and then work out the decimal equivalent.

Represent data using multiple encoding schemes.
Data representations occur at multiple levels of abstraction, from the physical storage of bits to the arrangement of information into organized formats (e.g., tables). Students should represent the same data in multiple ways. For example, students could represent the same color using binary, RGB values, hex codes (low-level representations), as well as forms understandable by people, including words, symbols, and digital displays of the color (high-level representations).

		<p>When you and I work with computers, we often work with numbers, letters, or graphics. But that's not what computers see! In this lab, we'll learn how computers store data.</p>
		
		<h3>Crunching Numbers</h3>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Start by downloading the starter project and saving into your account: Numbers, Bits, Electricity.</li>
				<li>
					First let's generate some numbers. Drag out some of the operator blocks into the main area.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/plus.png" alt="() + ()" title="() + ()" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/minus.png" alt="() - ()" title="() - ()" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/times.png" alt="() Ã— ()" title="() Ã— ()" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/divide.png" alt="() / ()" title="() / ()" />
				</li>
				<li>These blocks can do calculations just like your calculator. Stick some numbers in them and click to see the result. You can even nest them inside each other, which will calculate numbers just like when you use parentheses in a math expression.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			For example, this nesting of blocks...<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/nested-math-expression.png" alt="24 - ((60 Ã— 5) / 4 )" title="24 - ((60 Ã— 5) / 4 )" /><br />
			...is the same as (24 - ( (60 Ã— 5) / 4 )). You can imagine the rounded corners of the blocks to be the parentheses.
		</p>
		<p>
			As long as you've filled out both blanks, you should see numbers reported from all your blocks.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/60*5-reporting.png" alt="(60) Ã— (5) reporting '300'" title="(60) Ã— (5) reporting '300'" />
		</p>
		<p>Now, you've seen that computers know how to take numbers as input and how to output numbers... Or do they?? ðŸ‘€</p>
		
		
		<h3>Storing Numbers in Bits</h3>
		<div class="todo">In reviewing, compare with the <a href="https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-representation-compression/5-binary.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="CSP treatment of binary" target="_blank">CSP treatment of binary</a>. --MF, 8/17/21</div>

		<p>
			All the numbers that we typed above were <strong>decimal</strong> numbers. 
			<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Decimal Numerals</strong>
				<p>A <strong>decimal numeral</strong> is part of the base-10 system, the system most of us started learning as a toddler by counting numbers on our ten fingers and ten toes. The number system you use in daily life uses decimal numerals.</p>
				<p>A decimal numeral can have any digit from 0-9 for each place value. The first place is the ones place (10<sup>0</sup>=1), the second place is the tens place (10<sup>1</sup> = 10), the third place is the hundreds place (10<sup>2</sup> = 100), the fourth place is the thousands place (10<sup>3</sup> = 1,000), etc.</p>
			</div>
		<p>
			Consider the number 239:<br />
			<div class="indent bordered-table three-col" style="width:300px;">
				<div>2</div>
				<div>3</div>
				<div>9</div>
				<div>100s place</div>
				<div>10s place</div>
				<div>1s place</div>
			</div><br />
			That's equal to (2 Ã— 100) + (3 Ã— 10) + (9 Ã— 1). Two hundred and thirty nine!
		</p>
	
		<p>Computers actually store all numbers as <strong>binary</strong> numbers. All of their calculations are on binary numbers, too. They don't even know how to add two decimal numbers together! Instead, they first convert the decimal to binary and then do the adding.</p>
	
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Binary Numbers</strong>
			<p>A <strong>binary number</strong> can only have either the 0 or 1 digit in each place. The first place is the 1s place, the second place is the 2s place, the third place is the 4s place, and each place doubles after that.</p> 
		</div>
	
		<p>
			Consider the binary number 1010:<br />
			<div class="indent bordered-table four-col" style="width:400px;">
				<div>1</div>
				<div>0</div>
				<div>1</div>
				<div>0</div>
				<div>8s place</div>
				<div>4s place</div>
				<div>2s place</div>
				<div>1s place</div>
			</div><br />
			We can figure out the decimal equivalent by summing up all the places that have 1s - (8 + 2). That's the decimal number ten!
		</p>
		<p>We can also call each place a "bit" (short for binary digit), so 1010 is a 4-bit number. A number that's only a few digits long in decimal may be many bits long in binary, but that's okay, because bits are the only thing that computers know how to store.</p>
		<p>Okay, so your computer is constantly converting to binary behind the scenes (sneaky computer!). Let's see what that actually looks like ourselves though.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>
					Drag the <code>decimal to binary</code> block into the main area. You can type decimal numbers directly into that block or you can even drag your previous calculations into the block.  Click to see the results in bits.<br />
					<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/" alt="" title="" />
					<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/" alt="" title="" />
				</li>
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
					<ol>
						<li>Can you find a number that's the same in decimal and binary?</li>
						<li>Can you get a result that's all 1s? Hint: Start by trying to get just one 1, then two 1s, etc.</li>
						<li>Can you get a result that's 11110000? You may need a calculator and/or a teacher to figure this one out.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3>Storing Bits as Electricity</h3>
		<p>At this point, you might be wondering if you could dissect your computer and discover a bunch of 0s and 1s in the carcass. That'd be cool/creepy, but actually, computers don't really store the digits 0 and 1. </p>
		<p>Computers are electronic devices, so they store binary data using electricity. Generally, a 1 is stored as a positively charged electric signal and a 0 is stored as no charge at all.</p>
		<p>
			For example, the memory of your current computer most likely stores bits by storing charge in a capacitor. Here are some capacitors of varying sizes:<br />
			<div class="comment">Do we have rights to this image? --MF, 8/17/21</div>
			<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>The ones inside your computer are teeny tiny- around 20 nanometers! And a nanometer is a billionth of a meter! That's why your computer is able to store so much information.</p>
		<p>
			So, for the binary number 1010, we could imagine the computer actually storing it like this:<br />
			<div class="comment">Do we have rights to this image? --MF, 8/17/21</div>
			<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>In fact, we've made a block for you to visualize that for any decimal number!</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="6">
				<li>
					Drag the <code>binary to electricity</code> block into the main area. You can type binary numbers directly into that block, but better, you can drag the <code>decimal to binary</code> blocks into that block.<br />
					<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/" alt="" title="" />
				</li>
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
					<ol>
						<li>What numbers result in no capacitors charged at all?</li>
						<li>What numbers make all the capacitors light up with charge?</li>
						<li>What's a number that charges every capacitor but one?</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
