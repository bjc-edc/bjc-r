		<h3>Storing Numbers in Bits</h3>
        <div class="vocab">: <strong>Bit</strong>
            <p>The word "bit" is an abbreviation for <em><strong>bi</strong>nary digi<strong>t</strong>.</em></p>
        </div> 
		<p>We can also call each place a "bit" (short for binary digit), so 1010 is a 4-bit number. A number that's only a few digits long in decimal may be many bits long in binary, but that's okay, because bits are the only thing that computers know how to store.</p>
		<p>Okay, so your computer is constantly converting to binary behind the scenes (sneaky computer!). Let's see what that actually looks like ourselves though.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>
					Drag the <code>decimal to binary</code> block into the main area. You can type decimal numbers directly into that block or you can even drag your previous calculations into the block.  Click to see the results in bits.<br />

				</li>
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
					<ol>
						<li>Can you find a number that's the same in decimal and binary?</li>
						<li>Can you get a result that's all 1s? Hint: Start by trying to get just one 1, then two 1s, etc.</li>
						<li>Can you get a result that's 11110000? You may need a calculator and/or a teacher to figure this one out.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3>Storing Bits as Electricity</h3>
		<p>At this point, you might be wondering if you could dissect your computer and discover a bunch of 0s and 1s in the carcass. That'd be cool/creepy, but actually, computers don't really store the digits 0 and 1. </p>
		<p>Computers are electronic devices, so they store binary data using electricity. Generally, a 1 is stored as a positively charged electric signal and a 0 is stored as no charge at all.</p>
		<p>
			For example, the memory of your current computer most likely stores bits by storing charge in a capacitor. Here are some capacitors of varying sizes:<br />
			<div class="comment">Do we have rights to this image? --MF, 8/17/21</div>
			<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>The ones inside your computer are teeny tiny- around 20 nanometers! And a nanometer is a billionth of a meter! That's why your computer is able to store so much information.</p>
		<p>
			So, for the binary number 1010, we could imagine the computer actually storing it like this:<br />
			<div class="comment">Do we have rights to this image? --MF, 8/17/21</div>
			<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>In fact, we've made a block for you to visualize that for any decimal number!</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="6">
				<li>
					Drag the <code>binary to electricity</code> block into the main area. You can type binary numbers directly into that block, but better, you can drag the <code>decimal to binary</code> blocks into that block.<br />
					<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/" alt="" title="" />
				</li>
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
					<ol>
						<li>What numbers result in no capacitors charged at all?</li>
						<li>What numbers make all the capacitors light up with charge?</li>
						<li>What's a number that charges every capacitor but one?</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
