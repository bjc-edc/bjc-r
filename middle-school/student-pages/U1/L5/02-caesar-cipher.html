		<h2>Writing and Decoding Secret Messages</h2>
		<div class="todo">"Apply multiple methods of encryption to model the secure transmission of information. 
  Encryption can be as simple as letter substitution or as complicated as modern methods used to secure networks and the Internet. Students should encode and decode messages using a variety of encryption methods, and they should understand the different levels of complexity used to hide or secure information. For example, students could secure messages using methods such as Caesar cyphers or steganography (i.e., hiding messages inside a picture or other data). They can also model more complicated methods, such as public key encryption, through unplugged activities.

                <li>Write a secret message, invent some way of encoding the message, and then give the encoded message to someone else.</li>
                <li>Try to decode the message you receive. What strategies are you using to decode it?</li>

        </div>
		
		<h3>Caesar Cipher</h3>
		<p>
			One way to encode a message is with a <em>Caesar cipher</em> (named for Julius Caesar), which is also know as a <em>shift cipher</em>. To <em>encode</em> a message with a Caesar cipher:
			<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
    			<li>Write out the alphabet. Then write it again just below, but start with the A under a different letter and wrap around to the beginning when you reach the end. For example, this is a shift of 3:
					<div class="indent fixedwidth">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</div>
					<div class="indent fixedwidth">DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC<img class="noshadow nopad" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/this-is-the-key.jpg" alt="This is the key." title="This is the key." /></div>
				</li>
				<li>For each letter in your secret message, find the letter in the top row, and then write down the letter below it.</li>
			</ol>
        </p>
		<p>To <em>decode</em> a message: find each letter from the coded message in the second row (in the key) and write down the letter above it.</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>
					Decode this message using the Caesar cipher shown above:<br/>
					<div class="indent fixedwidth">FDHVDU'V PHVVDJHV ZHUHQ'W YHUB VHFXUH.</div>
					<div class="todo">CAESAR'S MESSAGES WEREN'T VERY SECURE.</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					The following message was also encoded using a Caesar cipher but with a shift of 11 instead of a shift of 3. Write out a key for messages with a shift of 11, and decode this message:<br/>

			</ol>
		</div>
	
		<h3>Other Simple Substitution Ciphers</h3>
		<p>
            The Caesar cipher is one kind of <em>simple substitution cipher</em> that is particularly easy to encode and decode. But simple substitution ciphers don't have to substitute letters in order. Here is a more secure example of a substitution cipher:
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</div>
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">PQVFUBZOTHWYELIXRNAMGDSCKJ<img class="noshadow nopad" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/this-is-the-key.jpg" alt="This is the key." title="This is the key." /></div>
        </p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="10">

					Decode this message using the simple substitution cipher shown just above:<br/>
					<div class="indent fixedwidth">VTXOUNA PNU UPAK MI VNPVW.</div>

				<li>If you intercepted a message that was created with a simple substitution cipher, how might you decode it without knowing the key?</li>
                <li>What are some ways the sender and receiver could make the encryption more secure than a simple substitution cipher?</li>

These characters won't get displayed in Snap<em>!</em>, so you can't copy them by hand, but if you use copy and paste, Snap<em>!</em> knows they are there.
