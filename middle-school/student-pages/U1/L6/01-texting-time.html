Standards

[2-AP-19] Document programs in order to make them easier to follow, test, and debug. Documentation allows creators and others to more easily use and understand a program. Students should provide documentation for end users that explains their artifacts and how they function. For example, students could provide a project overview and clear user instructions. They should also incorporate comments in their product and communicate their process using design documents, flowcharts, and presentations.

Solutions

Worksheet

Students may word things differently and still have a correct description.

The lowercase block turns every uppercase English letter into a lowercase letter, and does not affect other letters.
The songify block adds random music emojis at the start and end of the text.
The emojify block replaces particular words with corresponding emojis, and leaves the rest of the text unchanged.
The clapify block inserts a clap emoji between each of the letters in the text.
The binarize block replaces each letter with the binary number that represents that letter on the computer. That's according to the ASCII/Unicode encoding, but students do not have to understand that. 
The mystery block keeps only the letters from the text that are English consonants.
Challenge
The students may come up with different orders for nesting the blocks and come out with the same results.

From input: just do it
↳   Output: J👏🏽U👏🏽S👏🏽T👏🏽 D👏🏽O👏🏽 I👏🏽T👏🏽



From input: Oh Mister Golden Sun - please come out and play
↳   Output: 🎶 oh mister golden ☀️ - please come out and play! 🎵



From input: ABC
↳   Output: 11000101100011

		<h3>Styling Your Text Messages</h3>
		<p>Everyone has their own style of writing text messages&mdash;some all lowercase, SOME ALL UPPERCASE, some filled with emojis 🎉🤩🐱! </p>
		<p>In this project, you'll use reporters to add style to some text messages.</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Open this <a class="js-run-v7 snap-project" href="/bjc-r/middle-school/prog/texting-time.xml" title="Texting Time project" target="_blank">Texting Time project</a>, and save it to your account.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			The project starts with a bunch of blocks that know how to process bits of text:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/uppercase.png" alt="" title="" />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/lowercase.png" alt="" title="" />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/clapify.png" alt="" title="" />

		</p>
		<div class="endnote">Some of this is too elementary for where they are with Snap<em>!</em> at this point and needs to be revised. --MF, 9/30/21</div>
		<p>
			All of the blocks take text as input, so you can just type in anything on your keyboard. For example, the uppercase block capitalizes all the English letters in the text:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/uppercase-be-more-assertive-reporting.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			If you click that block in the project, you should see "BE MORE ASSERTIVE!"<br />

		</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">

				<li>Type different text in each of the other blocks and see what happens. Write some messages that you might actually write in your actual conversations.</li>

					Programmers often write descriptions of functions, to help other programmers understand how to use them.

			</ol>
		</div>

		
		<h3>Mix &amp; Match the Blocks!</h3>
		<p>In Snap<em>!</em> programming, you can nest other blocks inside of each other as long as their shapes fit. All these processing blocks have rounded corners (indicating they're "reporter" blocks), so they can be nested inside each other.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>
					Try dragging a block inside another block and see what happens. Some questions to explore:
					<ol>
						<li>What happens to the original text inside the block if you move a block inside it?</li>
						<li>Does it matter if you change the order, so that one block is on the inside versus the outside? Does it matter more for some blocks versus others?</li>
						<li>How many blocks can you put inside each other? Is there a limit?</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Share your remixes with your classmates and discuss your answers to the questions.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="ifTime show">
			<ol start="7">
				<li>
					If you want a challenge, see if you can nest the blocks to turn these input strings into the target output string:
					<ol>
						<li>From input: just do it<br />
					↳   Output: J👏🏽U👏🏽S👏🏽T👏🏽 D👏🏽O👏🏽 I👏🏽T👏🏽</li>
						<li>From input: Oh Mister Golden Sun - please come out and play<br />
					↳   Output: 🎶 oh mister golden ☀️ - please come out and play! 🎵
					</li>
						<li>From input: ABC<br />
					↳   Output: 11000101100011</li>
					</ol>
				</li>

		<h3>Draw a Conversation</h3>
		<p>Let's make it look like an actual conversation on a phone!</p>
			<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="8">
				<li>
					Find this block in the project:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/draw-convo-with-messages.png" alt="" title="" /><br />
					This is a command block that draws the conversation on the stage, just like an iPhone conversation. The block accepts any number of messages, but it can only draw as many that can fit on the iPhone screen at once.
				</li>
				<li>
					Drag one of your messages into the block. Remember that your message might be made up of a block inside another block.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/draw-convo-with-messages-with-inputs.png" alt="" title="" />
				</li>
				<li>Click the right arrow on the block to add more slots and drag more messages.</li>
				<li>Once you're done, show your classmates your conversation and check out theirs. A lot can happen in a short number of messages!</li>
			</ol>
