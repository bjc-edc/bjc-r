		<h3>A Brief History of Emojis</h3>
		<p>
			Emojis originally came from Japan, where they were built into mobile phones as a way of adding little pictures to text messages. Many of the emojis that we use today originated from that first set of Japanese emojis:<br />
			<div class="todo">From Brian: Speaking of replacing text with pictures, there's a ¬© symbol in Unicode. :)  Also, it'd be helpful to include the copyright date, not for legal reasons but to show how long ago this happened.  <p>Finally, this set of symbols should be recalled in the section on cultural issues; there are bunches of questions that can be raised:  Which of these are particularly Japanese in meaning?  Which seem bending over backward /not/ to be Japanese? (Namely, all the ones with English text.)   Are they all understandable today?  (Is that "CVS" one the emoji for drugstore?)  And there's another possible side topic about modern improvements in screen resolution; some of these are really hard to understand because they're so pixellated.</p></div>

		</p>
		<p>Emojis became very popular, so people from multiple countries came together to figure out how to bring emojis into software all over the world. Emojis became standardized, which means that there is a detailed document that describes how emojis should be transferred digitally, and that every emoji corresponds to a particular string of binary digits (0s and 1s).</p>
		<p>For example, üíñ is known as the "sparkling heart" emoji and is stored in binary accoridng to the Unicode standard as 11110000:10011111:10010010:10010110. A computer user doesn't have to know the binary of course, but computer programmers have to agree on it so that emojis are the same across devices. Imagine if üíñ got turned into üíî! That could be very awkward indeed.</p>

(Yes, that's a thing).</p>
			
		
		<h3>Analyze an Emoji</h3>
		<p>The <code>emojify word</code> replaces words with emojis, but does a word always match up exactly with an emoji? An emoji is a picture, and a picture might have a lot of different meanings to different people. Plus, a word can also have many meanings. It's time for an investigation.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Pick a word-emoji pair and analyze it with a partner. Discuss these questions, and fill out the worksheet together.
					<ol>
						<li>What does this emoji assume about the culture of the person using it?</li>
						<div class="commentBig">
							<ul>
								<li>From Brian: This [second] bullet point, I think, confuses two different issues: (1) the potential for cultural imperialism or insensitivity; (2) the fact that, in any language or culture, words can have homonyms that look/sound the same but are entirely unrelated.  The first issue is an important social implications of computing topic; the second is just an opportunity for meaningless snarkiness.</li>
								<li>From Pamela: Well, I guess I've found both issues to have practical implications when developing software (especially translation tools), but (1) is more interesting for them to discuss. Do you have a suggested re-word? I'll brainstorm otherwise.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<li>What other meanings could the word have? Are there example phrases where this emoji would make no sense?</li>
						<li>What other emojis could this word map to? Do you think any of them would be better?</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="endnote">
						For example, here's how we could analyze the "ball ‚Üí üèÄ" pair:
						<ul>
							<li><strong>What does this emoji assume about the culture of the person using it?</strong> It assumes that the person is familiar with the game of basketball.</li>
							<div class="commentBig">
								<ul>
									<li>From Brian: Been a while since I taught middle school, but one of those other meanings of "ball" will probably be the first thing the boys think of, and maybe it'd be better to choose a different example.</li>
									<li>From Pamela: Right. I wrote up this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BIDFHSimdSFhLqlpj_D52COhi_EUkbbN_MXsmzgPWSI/edit#heading=h.mtnv7jn0y1be" title="" target="_blank">dancer example</a> as well</li>
									<li>From Brian: No, I didn't mean that only boys play ball games.  I meant that "ball" is also slang for testicles.</li>
									<li>From Pamela: Lol yes I got that :) Do you like the dancer example?</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<li><strong>What other meanings could the word have?</strong> Are there example phrases where this emoji would make no sense? There are many kinds of balls, like balls used in other sports (baseballs, volleyballs, soccer balls), balls used as toys (beach balls, bouncy balls), and ball-shaped objects like crystal balls and balls of yarn. There are even other meanings of ball, as in the phrase "have a ball!".</li>
							<li><strong>What other emojis could this word map to? Do you think any of them would be better?</strong>  Some other options: üîÆ ‚öΩüß∂ üéæ üé± ‚ö´ The soccer ball might be the best option since soccer is currently the most popular game in in the world, so it's most likely to be recognized by the user as a ball.</li>

		<h3>Emoji Analysis</h3>
		<div class="todo">This was a Worksheet. --MF, 9/30/21</div>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="12">
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
					Discuss the following questions:
					<ul>
						<li>What does this emoji assume about the culture of the person using it?</li>
						<li>What other meanings could the word have? Are there example phrases where this emoji would make no sense?</li>
						<li>What other emojis could this word map to? Do you think any of them would be better?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3>Design an Emoji</h3>
		<div class="todo">This also was a Worksheet with three sections: Design, Possible meanings, Example usage. --MF, 9/30/21</div>

		<p>The <a href="https://home.unicode.org" title="Unicode Consortium" target="_blank">Unicode Consortium</a> is the organization in charge of emojis (as well as all the other characters in Unicode, the standard way of storing text in binary). They actually accept proposals from the public for new emojis. Check out <a href="http://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html" title="Unicode Consortium proposal process" target="_blank">their proposal process</a>.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="17">
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
				What emoji do you think the world needs? Maybe an emoji that would help you better express yourself on digital devices, or an emoji for your favorite hobby, or an emoji that represents a culture you come from.</li>
				<li>Draw the emoji on a sheet of paper or search the web for images that fit the ideas in your head. Think about how the emoji would look like in color as well as in black &amp; white; all emojis must be available in both forms, since not all digital devices support color. And of course, make sure your emoji isn't in Unicode! See the official emoji list.</li>
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
					Consider these questions from the official emoji proposal process:
					<ul>
						<li>Can the emoji be used in multiple contexts? Does it have literal as well as metaphoric meanings?</li>
						<li>Could the emoji be used in a sequence with other emojis to create meanings that aren't already possible?</li>
						<li>How different is the emoji to existing emoji? What's the most similar emoji?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Present your emojis to your classmates and the whole class. If you feel passionately about some of your proposals, perhaps you'll decide to go through the formal proposal process. Five years from now, you could be typing an emoji that you yourself proposed!</li>
