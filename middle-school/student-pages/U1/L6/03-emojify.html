2-AP-13
Decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs.
Students should break down problems into subproblems, which can be further broken down to smaller parts. Decomposition facilitates aspects of program development by allowing students to focus on one piece at a time (e.g., getting input from the user, processing the data, and displaying the result to the user). Decomposition also enables different students to work on different parts at the same time. For example, animations can be decomposed into multiple scenes, which can be developed independently.
Practice(s): Recognizing and Defining Computational Problems: 3.2


2-IC-21
Discuss issues of bias and accessibility in the design of existing technologies.
Students should test and discuss the usability of various technology tools (e.g., apps, games, and devices) with the teacher's guidance. For example, facial recognition software that works better for lighter skin tones was likely developed with a homogeneous testing group and could be improved by sampling a more diverse population. When discussing accessibility, students may notice that allowing a user to change font sizes and colors will not only make an interface usable for people with low vision but also benefits users in various situations, such as in bright daylight or a dark room.
Practice(s): Fostering an Inclusive Computing Culture: 1.2



Project extensions:
	You can change emojify to generate random emojis by changing:

<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/item-2-of-word-emoji-pair.png" alt="" title="" />

to:
	<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/item-random-of-all-but-first-of-word-emoji-pair.png" alt="" title="" />

Then you can add additional emojis to each list, and it will pick randomly from them.

		<h3>A Brief History of Emojis</h3>
		<p>
			Emojis originally came from Japan, where they were built into mobile phones as a way of adding little pictures to text messages. Many of the emojis that we use today originated from that first set of Japanese emojis:<br />
			<div class="todo">From Brian: Speaking of replacing text with pictures, there's a ¬© symbol in Unicode. :)  Also, it'd be helpful to include the copyright date, not for legal reasons but to show how long ago this happened.  Finally, this set of symbols should be recalled in the section on cultural issues; there are bunches of questions that can be raised:  Which of these are particularly Japanese in meaning?  Which seem bending over backward /not/ to be Japanese? (Namely, all the ones with English text.)   Are they all understandable today?  (Is that "CVS" one the emoji for drugstore?)  And there's another possible side topic about modern improvements in screen resolution; some of these are really hard to understand because they're so pixellated.</div>
			<div class="sidenote">Copyright ¬© (c) NTT DOCOMO, INC.</div>
			<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/emoji-chart.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>Emojis became very popular, so people from multiple countries came together to figure out how to bring emojis into software all over the world. Emojis became standardized, which means that there is a detailed document that describes how emojis should be transferred digitally, and that every emoji corresponds to a particular string of binary digits (0s and 1s).</p>
		<p>For example, üíñ is known as the "sparkling heart" emoji and is stored in binary as 11110000:10011111:10010010:10010110. A computer user doesn't have to know the binary of course, but computer programmers have to agree on it so that emojis are the same across devices. Imagine if üíñ got turned into üíî! That could be very awkward indeed.</p>
		<p>For a longer history of emojis, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsZBziJVzNA" title="" target="_blank">this talk</a> by a professional emoji historian. (Yes, that's a thing).</p>
			
		<h3>Understanding the <code>Emojify</code> Block</h3>
		<div class="ifTime show">
			<ol>
				<li>Open your "Texting Time" project, if it isn't open already.</li>
				<li>
					Right-click on the emojify block and select "Edit". You should see this in the block editor:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/emojify-definition.png" alt="" title="" />
				</li>
				<li><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> How does this block work?</li>
				<div class="endnote">
					<p><a href="#hint-emojify" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a detailed description of how the emojify block works.">Click for a detailed description.</a></p>
					<div id="hint-emojify" class="collapse">
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>The <code>emojify</code> block is a reporter block, so it uses a <code>report</code> block to send back a computed value to the main program.</li>
								<li>The <code>report</code> block has a nested <code>join</code> block. A <code>join</code> block joins together multiple strings of text into one long string of text.</li>
								<li>The <code>join</code> block has a nested <code>map</code> block. A <code>map</code> block performs the same operation on every item in a list and reports a new list containing those results. The first input is the operation, the second input is the list.</li>
								<li>The first input to the <code>map</code> block is another <code>join</code> block that joins the result of calling the <code>emojify word</code> block with a space character. </li><br>
								<li>The second input to <code>map</code> is the <code>split</code> block that splits the input text into a bunch of words.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>So for the phrase, "I love rain", that first gets split into the list "I", "love", "rain", then the emojify word block gets called on each word, resulting in the list "I", "‚ù§Ô∏è", "‚òîÔ∏è", and then finally, the join block turns that list into "I ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚òîÔ∏è".</p>
		<p>
			Here's the same process in a diagram:<br />

			<img class="indent" style="height:500px;" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/emojify-flowchart.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>

		<h3>Decomposing a Block</h3>
		<div class="todo">
			<ul>
				<li>From Brian: I'm not convinced this is a good strategy, especially when the extracted part includes a local variable, such as the input TEXT, which won't work outside the scope of that variable.  I'd use visible stepping instead.</li>
				<li>From Pamela: Hm I think I don't really understand how to use visual stepping, I haven't managed to use it correctly yet. How would you use it in this case? What is the order of clicking the blocks (and what are you clicking) and what modals do you have open?</li>
				<li>From Brian: First turn on visual stepping by clicking the footprint button.  Then right-click-edit the blocks you want to see inside of.  Use the slider to adjust the step speed; if the slider is all the way to the left, it does single-stepping, i.e., you have to click the pause button for each step.<br />While single stepping, you can right-click on the running script and the menu will have options to display the local variables of the script in watchers.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>
			Still unclear? A great way to understand a confusing program is to break it up into parts and see what each part does. To do that in Snap, open the block editor for <code>emojify</code>. Then right click on the <code>join</code> block inside the <code>report</code> block, and select "duplicate".<br />
			<img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/emojify-definition-duplicate.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>Then you can drag that <code>join</code> block into the main area and close the block editor. Once it's in the main area, you can keep duplicating blocks inside it, dragging them out, and examining how they work with different inputs.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>Open your "Texting Time" project, if it isn't open already.</li>
				<li>For an example, open the <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=pamelafox-ucb&ProjectName=Emojify Deep Dive&editMode" title="" target="_blank">Emojify Breakdown project</a>. Click on each of the blocks and see what they output. Make sure you understand each of the individual blocks, then try to understand a block inside a block, and then keep trying to understand another nesting of blocks until the whole emojify block makes sense.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>


		<h3>The <code>Emojify Word</code> Block</h3>
		<p>To complete your understanding of the <code>emojify</code> block, now you'll dig into the <code>emojify word</code> block.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="6">
				<li>
					Right-click on the <code>emojify word</code> block and select "Edit". You should see this in the block editor:<br />
					<div class="comment">todo: remake image with plain prototype labels</div>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/emojify-word-definition.png" alt="" title="" />
				</li>
				<div class="endnote">
					This is a very different looking block from the other block, but it is still a reporter block - see the report block at the bottom. Let's break it down:
					<ul>
						<div class="commentBig">
							<ul>
								<li>From Pamela: I'm trying to see if I can remove the use of variables so that we don't see those until unit 2.</li>
								<li>From Brian: Consider using the LET library block as an alternative.</li>
								<li>From Pamela: Dan also made a <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/versions/dev/snap.html#present:Username=dan%20garcia&ProjectName=BJC%20MS%20Texting%20Time%20v2%20with%20no%20script%20var" title="" target="_blank">version with a wrapper function</a>...Both of them require bringing in something thats not a standard palette block, so not sure what to go for.</li>
								<li>From Brian: Dan's wrapper function was hard for me to understand because I didn't see the "but" part at first, with that huge list in the way! :)  We really need the Scheme COND -> notation:<br />FIND FIRST... -> ITEM 2 OF.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<li>The block starts off by declaring a variable, <var>word emoji pair</var>. Script variables are useful whenever we want to store a piece of data and reference it later in the block.</li>
						<li>Then it sets that variable to the result of the <code>find first item</code> block. That block looks through a list of items and reports back the first item that matches a particular condition. In this case, the list input is a list of lists, where each list has a word as the first item and an emoji as the second item. The condition is whether the first item of the list is the same as the input parameter to the block. So, if the word is "pizza" the <code>find first item</code> will find the list which starts with "pizza" and report back the list "pizza", üçï.</li>
						<div class="commentBig">
							<ul>
								<li>Oof.  Missing antecedent.  "EMOJIFY WORD then reports..."  Also this handwaves away explaining what FIND FIRST reports if nothing matches the condition.</li>
								<li>Indeed. Leaving this comment here since this block of code is liable to change anyway.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<li>The <code>emojify word</code> block then reports either the second item of the <var>word emoji pair</var> if it exists, and otherwise reports the original word.</li>
					</ul>
					Just as you did for the emojify block, you can duplicate parts of this block and drag it out into the main area to see what each part does. 
				</div>			
			</ol>
		</div>
		

		<h3>Add More Emojis</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="6">
				<li>
					Add more word-emoji pairs by editing the <code>emojify word</code> block:
					<ol>
						<li>Add a new item by clicking the right arrow at the end of the <code>list</code> block. You should see a new input slot appear at the end of the list.</li>
						<li>Duplicate one of the nested word-emoji lists by right-clicking and selecting "duplicate". </li>
						<li>Drag the duplicated block into the newly added blank.</li>
						<li>Change the word and emoji by typing in the blanks. You can paste emojis from emojifinder.org or emojipedia.org. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					Test out your change! There are two ways to test it:
					<ol>
						<li>Drag an <code>emojify word</code> block into the main area, and type the new word in the blank. Click to see the new emoji.</li>
						<li>Drag an <code>emojify</code> block into the main area, and type any sentence that contains that word. Click to see the sentence with the new emoji included.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>You can continue to add more word-emoji pairs the same way. </li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		

		<h3>Analyze an Emoji</h3>
		<p>The <code>emojify word</code> replaces words with emojis, but does a word always match up exactly with an emoji? An emoji is a picture, and a picture might have a lot of different meanings to different people. Plus, a word can also have many meanings. It's time for an investigation.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="9">
				<li>
					<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Pick a word-emoji pair and analyze it with a partner. Discuss these questions, and fill out the worksheet together.
					<ol>
						<li>What does this emoji assume about the culture of the person using it?</li>
						<div class="commentBig">
							<ul>
								<li>From Brian: This [second] bullet point, I think, confuses two different issues: (1) the potential for cultural imperialism or insensitivity; (2) the fact that, in any language or culture, words can have homonyms that look/sound the same but are entirely unrelated.  The first issue is an important social implications of computing topic; the second is just an opportunity for meaningless snarkiness.</li>
								<li>From Pamela: Well, I guess I've found both issues to have practical implications when developing software (especially translation tools), but (1) is more interesting for them to discuss. Do you have a suggested re-word? I'll brainstorm otherwise.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<li>What other meanings could the word have? Are there example phrases where this emoji would make no sense?</li>
						<li>What other emojis could this word map to? Do you think any of them would be better?</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="endnote">
						For example, here's how we could analyze the "ball ‚Üí üèÄ" pair:
						<ul>
							<li><strong>What does this emoji assume about the culture of the person using it?</strong> It assumes that the person is familiar with the game of basketball.</li>
							<div class="commentBig">
								<ul>
									<li>From Brian: Been a while since I taught middle school, but one of those other meanings of "ball" will probably be the first thing the boys think of, and maybe it'd be better to choose a different example.</li>
									<li>From Pamela: Right. I wrote up this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BIDFHSimdSFhLqlpj_D52COhi_EUkbbN_MXsmzgPWSI/edit#heading=h.mtnv7jn0y1be" title="" target="_blank">dancer example</a> as well</li>
									<li>From Brian: No, I didn't mean that only boys play ball games.  I meant that "ball" is also slang for testicles.</li>
									<li>From Pamela: Lol yes I got that :) Do you like the dancer example?</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<li><strong>What other meanings could the word have?</strong> Are there example phrases where this emoji would make no sense? There are many kinds of balls, like balls used in other sports (baseballs, volleyballs, soccer balls), balls used as toys (beach balls, bouncy balls), and ball-shaped objects like crystal balls and balls of yarn. There are even other meanings of ball, as in the phrase "have a ball!".</li>
							<li><strong>What other emojis could this word map to? Do you think any of them would be better?</strong>  Some other options: üîÆ ‚öΩüß∂ üéæ üé± ‚ö´ The soccer ball might be the best option since soccer is currently the most popular game in in the world, so it's most likely to be recognized by the user as a ball.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</li>

		<h3>Emoji Analysis</h3>
		<div class="todo">This was a Worksheet. --MF, 9/30/21</div>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="12">
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
					Discuss the following questions:
					<ul>
						<li>What does this emoji assume about the culture of the person using it?</li>
						<li>What other meanings could the word have? Are there example phrases where this emoji would make no sense?</li>
						<li>What other emojis could this word map to? Do you think any of them would be better?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3>Design an Emoji</h3>
		<div class="todo">This also was a Worksheet with three sections: Design, Possible meanings, Example usage. --MF, 9/30/21</div>

		<p>The <a href="https://home.unicode.org" title="Unicode Consortium" target="_blank">Unicode Consortium</a> is the organization in charge of emojis (as well as all the other characters in Unicode, the standard way of storing text in binary). They actually accept proposals from the public for new emojis. Check out <a href="http://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html" title="Unicode Consortium proposal process" target="_blank">their proposal process</a>.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="17">
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
				What emoji do you think the world needs? Maybe an emoji that would help you better express yourself on digital devices, or an emoji for your favorite hobby, or an emoji that represents a culture you come from.</li>
				<li>Draw the emoji on a sheet of paper or search the web for images that fit the ideas in your head. Think about how the emoji would look like in color as well as in black &amp; white; all emojis must be available in both forms, since not all digital devices support color. And of course, make sure your emoji isn't in Unicode! See the official emoji list.</li>
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
					Consider these questions from the official emoji proposal process:
					<ul>
						<li>Can the emoji be used in multiple contexts? Does it have literal as well as metaphoric meanings?</li>
						<li>Could the emoji be used in a sequence with other emojis to create meanings that aren't already possible?</li>
						<li>How different is the emoji to existing emoji? What's the most similar emoji?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Present your emojis to your classmates and the whole class. If you feel passionately about some of your proposals, perhaps you'll decide to go through the formal proposal process. Five years from now, you could be typing an emoji that you yourself proposed!</li>
			</ol>
