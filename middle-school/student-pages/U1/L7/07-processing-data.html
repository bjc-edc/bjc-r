		<h2>Creating Blocks for <code>Combine</code></h2>
		<div class="todo">Pamela, should we teach/use the <code>distinct</code> block? It's currently in the XML (fully built), but not discussed or used anywhere. --MF, 12/10/21<br>I don't feel a strong need to teach/use it. -PF<p>Next revision: decide whether to remove it. --MF, 12/27/21</p></div>
		<div class="learn">
            <p>In this activity, you'll create functions that take two inputs (in any order) and use them with <code>combine</code> to perform them on a whole list.</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			It can be helpful to be able to find the maximum or minimum value in a list.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/max-of-list-reporting.png" alt="maximum of list {1, 22, 3, -4} reporting 22" title="maximum of list {1, 22, 3, -4} reporting 22" />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/min-of-list-reporting.png" alt="minimum of list {1, 22, 3, -4} reporting -4" title="minimum of list {1, 22, 3, -4} reporting -4" />
		</p>
		<p>
			You can use <code>combine</code> to find the maximum and minimum values in a list, but you need to create <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/maximum.png" alt="maximum of () and ()" title="maximum of () and ()" /> and <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/minimum.png" alt="minimum of () and ()" title="minimum of () and ()" /> functions that work with two inputs first. Then you can use them as inputs to <code>combine</code> to find the maximum or minimum for a whole list of values.
		</p>
<div class="comment">I'm confused, doesnt Snap have max built-in? I find it when I search for it. Students might find the built-in and wonder why they're building it themselves. -PF<p>I looked for them and didn't find them. Looks like they are hidden functions. ;P I do like the chance for students to review <code>if then else</code>, but I don't love having them build things that they don't need to "just for the sake of doing it." For the sake of wrapping up L7, I'm going to leave this issue to resolve with the next revision. --MF, 12/27/21</p></div>

				<li>Open your "Data Dos" project if it isn't open already.</li>
                <li>
					Complete the block definition for the <code>maximum</code> and <code>minimum</code> blocks so that they take two inputs, check which input value is greater (or lesser), and then report one of the two input values.

								<p>You can use the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" /> together with <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/greater-than.png" alt="() > ()" title="() > ()" /> or <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/less-than.png" alt="() < ()" title="() < ()" /> to decide which input to report. You learned about <code>if then else</code> in <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U1/L6/02-l33t-text.html?topic=middle-school%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="You learned about 'if then else' in Unit 1 Lab 6 Activity 2: L33t Text">Lab 6 Activity 2: L33t Text</a>.</p>

				<li>Test the <code>maximum</code> and <code>minimum</code> blocks with different input values before you move on.</li>
				<li>
                    Use these blocks with <code>combine</code> to complete the block definitions for  <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/maximum-of-list.png" alt="maximum of 'list input slot'" title="maximum of 'list input slot'" /> and <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/minimum-of-list.png" alt="minimum of 'list input slot'" title="minimum of 'list input slot'" />. These new blocks should take a list as input and report the maximum or minimum value in the list.<br />
                </li>
				<li>Test your <code>maximum of list</code> and <code>minimum of list</code> blocks.</li>
				<li>
					<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />
					Design and answer a question to ask about your data that requires the either <code>maximum of list</code> or <code>minimum of list</code> block to answer it.
					<div class="endnote" style="clear: right;">For example, you might ask: "What's the maximum number of years that any of the people who responded to my survey have played their favorite sport?"</div>

		<div class="learn"><p>In this activity, you created the <code>maximum</code> and <code>minimum</code> blocks to use with the <code>combine</code> function, created <code>maximum of list</code> and <code>minimum of list</code> blocks, and used them to explore your data.</p></div>
