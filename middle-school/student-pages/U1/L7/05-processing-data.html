		<h3><code>Combining</code> Elements of a List</h3>
		<p>You can use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/combine.png" alt="combine 'list input slot' using 'reporter input slot'" title="combine 'list input slot' using 'reporter input slot'" /> to apply the <code>join</code> function to all the elements in a list.</p>
		
		
		<p> The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/combine.png" alt="combine 'list input slot' using 'reporter input slot'" title="combine 'list input slot' using 'reporter input slot'" /> block takes two inputs: a list and an operation <em>with two inputs</em>, and it reports the result of combining all the elements in the input list using the input operation. For example, the expression below reports: 0 + 1 + 2.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine-simple-example.png" alt="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3" title="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3" />
        </p>
        
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p><strong>You choose the operation, and <code>combine</code> performs that operation by <em>combining</em> all the items in the input list and then reports the result.</strong></p>
            <p>Notice that the function used to <em>combine</em> the list items always has two blank input slots. The <code>keep</code> block only needs one blank in its input function, but with <code>combine</code>, two are required.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p><code>Combine</code> is a <em>higher-order function</em>; it is a function that takes a function as input. You've seen another higher-order function already: <code>keep</code> (in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/5-keeping-list-items.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Keeping Items from a List">Unit 2 Lab 3</a>).</p>

			It can also be helpful to be able to find the maximum or minimum value in a list. You can use <code>combine</code> to do that, but you'll need to create these functions first:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/maximum.png" alt="maximum of () and ()" title="maximum of () and ()" />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/minimum.png" alt="minimum of () and ()" title="minimum of () and ()" /><br />
			These blocks should take two inputs, check which input value is greater (or lesser), and then decide report one of the two input values.

                Unlike <code>map</code>, the <code>combine</code> function is only used with a few input functions.

                            The function has to be <em>associative</em>, meaning that it can't matter what order you group the items in. For example, addition is associative: (7&thinsp;+&thinsp;8)&thinsp;+&thinsp;1 is the same as 7&thinsp;+&thinsp;(8&thinsp;+&thinsp;1) (work it out yourself), but subtraction is not: (7&thinsp;−&thinsp;8)&thinsp;−&thinsp;1 is different from 7&thinsp;−&thinsp;(8&thinsp;−&thinsp;1).
                            So expressions like <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine-minus.png" alt="combine with (-) items of (list 7 8 1)"> would be ambiguous.
