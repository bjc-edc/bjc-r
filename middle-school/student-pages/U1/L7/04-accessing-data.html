		<h2>Accessing Your Data</h2>
		<div class="todo">For U2, need to teach <code>length of list</code> and <code>/</code>.</div>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll build blocks to help you access specific data from your table so that you can analyze it to answer your research questions.</div>
        
		
		<h3>Accessing the Responses</h3>
		<p>
			As you process the data, it will be helpful to be able to separate the questions from the responses in the rows below.<br />
			<div class="comment">needs alt/title text</div>
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/my-survey-sports-3-rows-augmented.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>You already have a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/questions-only.png" alt="questions only from survey 'list input slot'" title="questions only from survey 'list input slot'" /> block that takes a survey as input and report the <em>first row</em> (the questions). </p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<div class="todo">Do we need a example of what this block should report?</div>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em>, and open your "Data Dos" project.</li>
				<li>
					Create code for the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/responses-only.png" alt="responses only from survey 'list input slot'" title="responses only from survey 'list input slot'" /> block so that it takes a survey as input and reports <em>everything but the first row</em> (the responses).
					<div class="endnote">Look back at the code inside <code>questions only</code>. While <code>item of</code> reports <em>one item</em> in a list, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/all-but-first.png" alt="all but first of 'list input slot'" title="all but first of 'list input slot'" /> reports <em>everything except one item</em> (specifically, everything except the <em>first</em> item). For a table, <code>all but first</code> will report all rows except the first row.</div>
				</li>
				<li>Test the <code>responses only</code> block with your survey data, and make sure it works as intended.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>You'll also need a way to access a single <em>column</em> of data. In Snap<em>!</em>, table data are stored as a list of lists. So, a column is a list of the items at a specific position in every row.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>
					Edit the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/responses-to-question.png" alt="responses to question () from survey data 'list input slot'" title="responses to question () from survey data 'list input slot'" /> block. It takes a <var>question number</var> (the position number of one question) and survey data as input. Create code to make the block report all the responses to that question (but not the question itself).<br />

		<h3><code>Keep</code>ing Specific Items from Your List</h3>
		<p>
			You can already learn some things about the data you have collected by using the <code>keep</code> and <code>length</code> blocks. For example, you might want to know how many students that you surveyed study more than 5 hours a week.
			<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/length-of-keep-reporting.png" alt="length of (keep items (( ) > (5)) from (responses to question (2) from (my survey))) reporting 2" title="length of (keep items (( ) > (5)) from (responses to question (2) from (my survey))) reporting 2" />
		</p>
		<p>
			(You can use <code>responses to question</code> to select the data for one question, then use <code>keep</code> to select responses meeting a certain criteria.)</p>
			<p>The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/length-list.png" alt="length of 'list input slot'" title="length of 'list input slot'" /> block takes a list as input and reports the length of that list.</p>
		<div class="endnote">
			If the input to <code>length of list</code> is a list of lists, it will report the number of lists in the list. If you want to know the length of one of your lists inside the list, you first need to select the data you want to ask the length of by using <code>responses to question</code>.
		</div>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>Review <code>keep</code> then use it for what's the average GPA for students who study more than 10 hours a week? What's the average GPA for students who study less than 10 hours per week?</p>
			<p>Also: What's the maximum GPA for students in your group? What's the maximum number of hours studied?</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="todo">They have not yet learned KEEP!!
		<div class="todo">Predicate formalizing being postponed until U2</div>

				<p>As you know, predicates can be used with conditionals to decide <em>when</em> to <em>do</em> something; they can also be used with <code>keep</code> to decide <em>which</em> things to keep. The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" title="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" /> block takes a list and a predicate as input, and it reports a new list keeping only the items from the input list that make the condition described by the predicate true.</p>
		
        <p>
            For example, the following expression will find words from the <var>words list</var> whose first letter is v. The <em>blank input slot</em> is where each item of the list goes to decide if it will be kept.<br>
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/keep-example-6.png" alt="keep items  ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)" title="keep items  ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)">

            <ul>
                <div class="comment">AAP-1.C.4</div>
                <li>A <strong>string</strong> is an ordered sequence of characters.</li>
                <div class="comment">AAP-1.C.3 (strings)</div>

The same word is used for the position of a character in a string (for example, a letter in a word). So the first input to <code>letter</code> is the index.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
<div class="todo">They may have some idea about keep from find first in the emoji lab</div>

        <div class="takeNote">
            <p><strong>You write the predicate that does the checking, and <code>keep</code> applies the predicate to each item in the input list and then reports the list of items that make your predicate <code>true</code></strong>.</p>
			<p>Note that the blank input slot in the predicate is <em>required</em>; this is where each item from the list goes as it is checked by the predicate.</p>
            <div class="endnote">The <code>letter</code> block in the palette looks like <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/letter-1-of-world.png" alt="letter (1) of (world)" title="letter (1) of (world)" />.  You have to delete the "world" so that there is a blank slot where you need it to be.</div>
