		<h2>Accessing Your Data</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll build blocks to help you access specific data from your table.</div>
		
		<p>
			As you process the data in your <var>my survey</var> table, it will be helpful to be able to separate the questions from the responses.<br />

Row 1 has the values: 'Favorite sport?' and 'Years played?'. Row 1 is circled and labeled 'Questions only,' and the remaining three rows are circled together and labeled 'Responses only.'

			You already have a <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/questions-only.png" alt="questions only from survey 'list input slot'" title="questions only from survey 'list input slot'" /> block that takes a survey as input and reports the <em>first row</em> (the questions). <a href="#hint-questions-only" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an example of how 'questions only' works.">Click for an example.</a>
			<div id="hint-questions-only" class="collapse">
				<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/questions-only-reporting.png" alt=" questions only from survey (my survey) reporting the list {How many years have you been playing music?, How many hours do you listen to music each day?}" title="questions only from survey (my survey) reporting the list {How many years have you been playing music?, How many hours do you listen to music each day?}" />
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			The code inside <code>questions only</code> uses <code>item of</code>, which reports <em>one item</em> in a list. <a href="#hint-questions-only-code" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click to see the code inside 'questions only'.">Click to see the code inside.</a>
			<div id="hint-questions-only-code" class="collapse">
				<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/questions-only-definition.png" alt="questions only from survey (survey data) {

}" title="questions only from survey (survey data) {
	report (item (1) from (survey data))
}" />
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/responses-only.png" alt="responses only from survey 'list input slot'" title="responses only from survey 'list input slot'" /> block should report <em>everything but the first row</em> (the responses). <a href="#hint-responses-only" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an example of how 'responses only' works.">Click for an example.</a>
			<div id="hint-responses-only" class="collapse">
				<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/responses-only-reporting.png" alt="responses only from survey (my survey) reporting a table with three rows and two columns. Row 1 has the values: 'soccer' and '4'. Row 2 has the values 'basketball' and '3'.

Row 2 has the values 'basketball' and '3'. Row 3 values: 'soccer' and '5'." />
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			To make it work, you can use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/all-but-first.png" alt="all but first of 'list input slot'" title="all but first of 'list input slot'" />, which takes a list as input and reports <em>everything except the first item</em>. <a href="#hint-all-but-first" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an example of how 'all but first' works.">Click for an example.</a>
			<div id="hint-all-but-first" class="collapse">
				<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/all-but-first-example.png" alt="all but first of (list (apple) (banana) (carrot) (daikon)) reporting the list {banana, carrot, daikon}" title="all but first of (list (apple) (banana) (carrot) (daikon)) reporting the list {banana, carrot, daikon}" />
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>In Snap<em>!</em>, a table is a list of lists. So for a table, <code>all but first</code> will report everything except the first row.</p>
		<div class="endnote">Reminder: To get another <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/my-survey.png" alt="my survey" title="my survey" /> variable, you can either drag one out of the palette on the left or right-click (or control-click on a Mac) one that you already have and choose "duplicate."</div>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em>, and open your "Data Dos" project.</li>
				<div class="sidenoteBig">
						<p><a href="#hint-responses-only-tip" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a hint about building the 'responses only from survey' block.">Click for a hint.</a></p>
						<div id="hint-responses-only-tip" class="collapse"><p>The responses are <em>all but the first</em> row of the table.</p></div>

				<li>Test the <code>responses only</code> block with your survey data, and make sure it works as intended.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>You'll also need a way to access a single <em>column</em> of data. In Snap<em>!</em>, table data are stored as a list of lists. So, a column is a list of the items at a specific position in every row.</p>
