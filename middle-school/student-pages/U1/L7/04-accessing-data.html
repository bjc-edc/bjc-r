		<h2>Accessing Your Data</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll build blocks to help you access specific data from your table.</div>
		
		<p>
			As you process the data, it will be helpful to be able to separate the questions from the responses.<br />

			The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/all-but-first.png" alt="all but first of 'list input slot'" title="all but first of 'list input slot'" /> block takes a list as input and reports <em>everything except one item</em> (specifically, everything except the <em>first</em> item). <a href="#hint-all-but-first" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an example of how 'all but first' works.">Click for an example.</a>

		</p>
		<p>For a table, <code>all but first</code> will report all rows except the first row.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em>, and open your "Data Dos" project.</li>

				<li>Test the <code>responses only</code> block with your survey data, and make sure it works as intended.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>You'll also need a way to access a single <em>column</em> of data. In Snap<em>!</em>, table data are stored as a list of lists. So, a column is a list of the items at a specific position in every row.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you created a block to access all but the first row of your survey data (just the responses) and a block to access a single column from your survey data (all the responses to a specific question).</div>

		<div class="todo"><hr><h1>Break?</h1><hr></div>

		<h3><code>Keep</code>ing Specific Items from Your List</h3>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll select only responses that meet specific criteria and count them.</div>
        <div class="todo">have them use KEEP at least once even if they don't use it for their official analysis. --MF, 11/30/21</div>
		<p>
			Snap<em>!</em> has two built-in blocks that may be useful to your data anlyasis:
			<ul>
				<li>The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/length-list.png" alt="length of 'list input slot'" title="length of 'list input slot'" /> block takes a list as input and reports the length of that list.</li>
				<li>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" title="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" /> block filters a list, reporting back only the items that met certain criteria.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			<div class="comment">Choose a different survey context here. This is out of date. Need two nice examples with corresponding questions. --MF, 12/9/21</div>
			You can use these blocks together to learn things about your data. For example, you might want to know how many survey respondents study more than 5 hours a week:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/length-of-keep-reporting.png" alt="length of (keep items (( ) > (5)) from (responses to question (2) from (my survey))) reporting 2" title="length of (keep items (( ) > (5)) from (responses to question (2) from (my survey))) reporting 2" />
		</p>
		<div class="endnote">If the input to <code>length of list</code> is a list of lists, it will report the number of lists in the list. </div>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>Review <code>keep</code> then use it for what's the average GPA for students who study more than 10 hours a week? What's the average GPA for students who study less than 10 hours per week?</p>
			<p>Also: What's the maximum GPA for students in your group? What's the maximum number of hours studied?</p>
		</div>
	<div class="todo">1.7.1 phrasing: "Make Snap! identify the maximum, minimum, and average number of years spent playing music, use that to choose a cutoff value (such as three years of playing music), and then have Snap! find the average hours spent listening for people who have played more than or less than that cutoff value and compare."</div>

		
		<div class="todo">They have not yet learned KEEP!!
		
		<div class="todo">Predicate formalizing being postponed until U2</div>

				<p>As you know, predicates can be used with conditionals to decide <em>when</em> to <em>do</em> something; they can also be used with <code>keep</code> to decide <em>which</em> things to keep. The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" title="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" /> block takes a list and a predicate as input, and it reports a new list keeping only the items from the input list that make the condition described by the predicate true.</p>
		
        <p>
            For example, the following expression will find words from the <var>words list</var> whose first letter is v. The <em>blank input slot</em> is where each item of the list goes to decide if it will be kept.<br>
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/keep-example-6.png" alt="keep items  ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)" title="keep items  ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)">
		</p>
        
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>String</strong> and <strong>Index</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>string</strong> is an ordered sequence of characters.</li>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/2-quizzes.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="You've already learned the word index">You've already learned</a> the word <strong>index</strong> for the position of an element in a list. The same word is used for the position of a character in a string (for example, a letter in a word). So the first input to <code>letter</code> is the index.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
<div class="todo">They may have some idea about keep from find first in the emoji lab</div>

        <div class="takeNote">
            <p><strong>You write the predicate that does the checking, and <code>keep</code> applies the predicate to each item in the input list and then reports the list of items that make your predicate <code>true</code></strong>.</p>
			<p>Note that the blank input slot in the predicate is <em>required</em>; this is where each item from the list goes as it is checked by the predicate.</p>
            <div class="endnote">The <code>letter</code> block in the palette looks like <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/letter-1-of-world.png" alt="letter (1) of (world)" title="letter (1) of (world)" />.  You have to delete the "world" so that there is a blank slot where you need it to be.</div>
		</div>
		
		</div>	
		
<div class="forYouToDo">

				<li>Use <code>length</code> together with <code>keep</code> to discover one or more things about your data.</li>
