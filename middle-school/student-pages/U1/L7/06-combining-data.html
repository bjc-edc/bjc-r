		<h2><code>Combine</code>-ing Data</h2>
		<div class="todo">Pamela, what do you think about this activity page title? I changed it <em>many</em> times, and this is where I landed. --MF, 12/10/21</div>
		<div class="learn">
            <p>In this activity, you'll create blocks to make Snap<em>!</em> do math with your data for you.</p>
        </div>
		<p>
			Snap<em>!</em> has another built-in block that is useful for data analysis: The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/combine.png" alt="combine 'list input slot' using 'predicate input slot'" title="combine 'list input slot' using 'predicate input slot'" /> block combines the elements of a list using an operation. For example, this expression adds all the values in the list 0, 1, 2.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine-simple-example.png" alt="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3" title="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3" />
		</p>
		<div class="takeNote">
            <p>Notice that the function used to <em>combine</em> the list items needs has <em>two</em> blank input slots. The <code>keep</code> block only needs one blank in its input function, but with <code>combine</code>, two are required.</p>
        </div>
	
		<h3>Finding a Sum</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Open your "Data Dos" project if it isn't open already.</li>
				<li>
					Complete the block definition for the <code>sum of list</code> block so that it reports the sum of the items of a list.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/sum-of-list-reporting.png" alt="sum of {1, 2, 3, 10} reporting 16" title="sum of {1, 2, 3, 10} reporting 16" />
                </li>
				<li>Test the <code>sum of list</code> block by dragging a <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/list-full-size.png" alt="list ()" title="list ()" /> block into the input slot, giving it additional input spaces by clicking the right-facing triangle, and adding some numbers to sum up. Make sure the block works correctly before moving on.</li>
				<li>
					Revisit your investigation topic, and design and answer a question that requires the 	<code>sum</code> block to answer it.
					<div class="endnote">For example, you might ask: "How many years in total have the people who responded to my survey played their favorite sport?"</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<div class="endnote">
			<p>Unlike <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> which also take functions as inputs, the <code>combine</code> function is used with only a few input functions.</p>
			<p><a href="#hint-which-functions" data-toggle="collapse" title="Which functions?">Which functions?</a></p>
			<div id="hint-which-functions" class="collapse">
				<p>
					<code>Combine</code> is mostly used only with <em>these functions</em>:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/plus.png" alt="+" title="+" /> <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/times.png" alt="&times;" title="&times;" /><br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/and-block.png" alt="and" title="and" /> <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/or-block.png" alt="or" title="or" /><br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/join.png" alt="join" title="join" /> <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/join-words.png" alt="join words" title="join words" /><br />
					and the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/maximum.png" alt="maximum of () ()" title="maximum of () ()" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/minimum.png" alt="minimum of () ()" title="minimum of () ()" /> blocks that you'll write on the next activity page.
				</p>
				<p><a href="#hint-why-only-these" data-toggle="collapse" title="Why can 'combine' only use these functions?">Why only these functions?</a></p>
				<div id="hint-why-only-these" class="collapse">
					<p><code>Combine</code> takes a <em>list</em> of values as input. It combines the first two values using the input function, then combines that result with the third value using the function, then combines that result with the next value, and so on.</p>
					<p>So, it can't matter to the input function in what order you group the items. Notice that (4&thinsp;+&thinsp;1)&thinsp;+&thinsp;3 is the same as 4&thinsp;+&thinsp;(1&thinsp;+&thinsp;3), but (4&thinsp;−&thinsp;1)&thinsp;−&thinsp;3 is different from 4&thinsp;−&thinsp;(1&thinsp;−&thinsp;3). With <code>combine</code>, we don't use functions where order matters (such as subtraction or division).</p>

                </li>
				<li>Test your code for the <code>average of list</code> block, and fix any problems.</li>
				<div class="takeNote">Notice that if you hadn't checked that your <code>sum of list</code> block works first, then you wouldn't know whether any problems with your <code>average of list</code> block were really problems with <code>average of list</code> or were actually problems with <code>sum of list</code>.</div>
				<li>
					Design and answer a question to ask about your data that requires the 	<code>average of list</code> block to answer it.
					<div class="endnote">For example, you might ask: "How many hours on average do the people who responded to my survey listen to music each day?"</div>

			 <p>In this activity, you used the higher-order function <code>combine</code> to create <code>sum</code> and <code>average of list</code> blocks and used them to explore your data.</p>
