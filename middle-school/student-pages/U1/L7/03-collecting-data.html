		<h2>Collecting Your Data</h2>
		<div class="learn">
            <p>In this activity, you will gather responses to your survey questions.</p>
        </div>
		<p>
			The data you collect will be stored as table. As you collect data, the list will fill up with additional rows, but the survey questions will remain as the first row of the survey. For example:<br />

Row 3 as the values '0' and '3'. Row 4 as the values '2' and '1.5'." title="'my survey' watcher: a table with four rows and two columns.

		<h3>Asking the User a Question</h3>
		<p>
			This project also includes an <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/ask.png" alt="ask ()" title="ask ()" /> block that takes a question as input, asks the user the question, and reports the user's response.<br />
		</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em>, and open your "Data Dos" project.</li>
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
 Look at the code inside the <code>questions only</code> block, and discuss how the block works (even when the survey is full of data).

		<h3>Adding New Responses to Your Table</h3>
		<p>The <code>questions only</code> block will report a list of the questions from the survey, and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/map.png" alt="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" title="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" /> will allow you to apply <code>ask</code> to every question in the list.</p>
		<div class="endnote">You learned about the <code>map</code> block in <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U1/L4/04-pixel-mapper.html?topic=middle-school%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 4 Activity 4: Transforming Every Pixel">Lab 4 Activity 4: Transforming Every Pixel</a>.</div>
               <div class="commentBig">Hmm, flow feels off to me. What about something that connects it more with the last Q of the last part? Like "The missing tool is the map block, which can apply an action to each item in a list. In this case, the action is ask'ing the user, and the list are the questions reported from [questions only]." Maybe that feels too obvious though? -PF 11/27</div>

<div class="commentBig">Also: will students know how to duplicate the my survey variable or drag it from the side?
