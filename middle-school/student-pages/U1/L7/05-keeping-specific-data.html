		<h2><code>Keep</code>ing Specific Data</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll select only responses that meet specific criteria and count them.</div>
        <div class="todo">have them use KEEP at least once even if they don't use it for their official analysis. --MF, 11/30/21</div>
		<p>
			Snap<em>!</em> has two built-in blocks that may be useful to your data analysis:
			<ul>
				<li>The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/length-list.png" alt="length of 'list input slot'" title="length of 'list input slot'" /> block takes a list as input and reports the length of that list.</li>
				<li>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" title="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" /> block filters a list, reporting back only the items that met certain criteria.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em>, and open your "Data Dos" project.</li>
				<li>Test the <code>length</code> block by using it to count the number of responses to your survey.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	
		<p>
			You can use <code>keep</code> to select specific responses. For example, you could keep just the responses to question 1 that were soccer:<br />
			<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/my-survey-sports-3-rows.png" alt="'my survey' watcher: a table with three rows and two columns. Row 1 column 1 has the text: 'Favorite sport?' and row 1 column 2 has the text: 'Years played?' Row 2 as the values 'soccer' and '4'. Row 3 as the values 'basketball' and '3'. Row 4 as the values 'soccer' and '5'." title="'my survey' watcher: a table with three rows and two columns. Row 1 column 1 has the text: 'Favorite sport?' and row 1 column 2 has the text: 'Years played?' Row 2 as the values 'soccer' and '4'. Row 3 as the values 'basketball' and '3'. Row 4 as the values 'soccer' and '5'." />
			<div class="todo">both Need alt text</div>
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/keep-soccer-from-responses.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Or as another example, you could keep just the items greater than 3 from the responses to question 2: <br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/keep-gt3-from-responses.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>Try using <code>keep</code> to filter your data at least two times. Filter the data for two different questions using two different criteria. </li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			You can use <code>length</code> together with <code>keep</code> to learn specific things about your data. For example, if you wanted to know how many people that you surveyed named soccer as their favorite sport, you could do:<br />
			<div class="comment">both Need alt text</div>
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/length-keep-soccer.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			And if you wanted to know how many people said that they've played their favorite sport for more than 3 years, you could do: <br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/length-keep-gt3.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>Use <code>length</code> together with <code>keep</code> to discover one or more things about your data.</li>
				<li>
					Describe what your code does.
					<div class="endnote">
						For example: This code tells us that 2 survey respondents said "soccer" was their favorite sport on question 1.<br />
						<div class="comment"> Needs alt text - same as above</div>
						<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/length-keep-soccer.png" alt="" title="" />
					</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="learn">
            <p>In this activity, you used <code>length</code> together with <code>keep</code> to begin analyzing your data.</p>
