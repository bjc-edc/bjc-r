		<h2>Accessing Your Data</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll build code for blocks to help you access specific data from your table so that you can analyze it to answer your research questions.</div>
        <p>As you process the data you have collected, it will be helpful to have a way to separate the questions stored in the first row of the table from the survey responses in the rows below.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<div class="todo">Add examples</div>
				<li>
					The following two blocks are in your project, but they don't do anything yet. Edit them, and create code to make them work as described below.
					<ol>
						<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/questions-only.png" alt="questions only from survey 'list input slot'" title="questions only from survey 'list input slot'" /> should take survey data as input and report the first row of data in the table.</li>
						<div class="endnote">In a table<!-- (a list of lists)-->, each row is a list of items<!-- (the items in the row)-->, and you can use <code>item of</code> to select one<!-- row from the table (one list from the list of lists)-->.

						<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/data-only.png" alt="data only from survey 'list input slot'" title="data only from survey 'list input slot'" /> should take survey data as input and report <em>everything but</em> the first item.</li>
						<div class="endnote">While <code>item of</code> reports <em>one item</em> in a list, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/all-but-first.png" alt="all but first of 'list input slot'" title="all but first of 'list input slot'" /> reports <em>everything except</em> one item (specifically, everything except the <em>first</em> item). For a table, <code>all but first</code> will report all rows except the first row.</div>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Try out both of these blocks with your survey data, and make sure they work as intended.</li>

		<h3><code>Keeping</code> Specific Items from Your List</h3>
		<div class="todo">They have not yet learned KEEP!!
		<div class="todo">Pedicate formalizing being postponed until U2</div>

				<p>As you know, predicates can be used with conditionals to decide <em>when</em> to <em>do</em> something; they can also be used with <code>keep</code> to decide <em>which</em> things to keep. The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" title="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" /> block takes a list and a predicate as input, and it reports a new list keeping only the items from the input list that make the condition described by the predicate true.</p>
		
        <p>
            For example, the following expression will find words from the <var>words list</var> whose first letter is v. The <em>blank input slot</em> is where each item of the list goes to decide if it will be kept.<br>
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/keep-example-6.png" alt="keep items  ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)" title="keep items  ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)">
		</p>
        
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>String</strong> and <strong>Index</strong>
            <ul>
                <div class="comment">AAP-1.C.4</div>
                <li>A <strong>string</strong> is an ordered sequence of characters.</li>
                <div class="comment">AAP-1.C.3 (strings)</div>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/2-quizzes.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="You've already learned the word index">You've already learned</a> the word <strong>index</strong> for the position of an element in a list. The same word is used for the position of a character in a string (for example, a letter in a word). So the first input to <code>letter</code> is the index.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="takeNote">
            <p><strong>You write the predicate that does the checking, and <code>keep</code> applies the predicate to each item in the input list and then reports the list of items that make your predicate <code>true</code></strong>.</p>
			<p>Note that the blank input slot in the predicate is <em>required</em>; this is where each item from the list goes as it is checked by the predicate.</p>
            <div class="endnote">The <code>letter</code> block in the palette looks like <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/letter-1-of-world.png" alt="letter (1) of (world)" title="letter (1) of (world)" />.  You have to delete the "world" so that there is a blank slot where you need it to be.</div>
		</div>

		
		</div>

		<p>You can already learn some things about the data you have collected by using the <code>keep</code> and <code>length</code> blocks. For example, you might want to know how many students that you surveyed study more than 5 hours a week.
		<div class="todo">
<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/length-of-keep-reporting.png" alt="length of (keep items (( ) > (5)) from (responses to question (2) from (my survey))) reporting 2" title="length of (keep items (( ) > (5)) from (responses to question (2) from (my survey))) reporting 2" /></div>
			(You can use <code>responses to question</code> to select the data for one question, then use <code>keep</code> to select responses meeting a certain criteria.)</p>
			<p>The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/length-list.png" alt="length of 'list input slot'" title="length of 'list input slot'" /> block takes a list as input and reports the length of that list.</p>
		<div class="endnote">
			If the input to <code>length of list</code> is a list of lists, it will report the number of lists in the list. If you want to know the length of one of your lists inside the list, you first need to select the data you want to ask the length of by using <code>responses to question</code>.
		</div>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>Review <code>keep</code> then use it for what's the average GPA for students who study more than 10 hours a week? What's the average GPA for students who study less than 10 hours per week?</p>
			<p>Also: What's the maximum GPA for students in your group? What's the maximum number of hours studied?</p>
