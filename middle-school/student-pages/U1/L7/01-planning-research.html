		<h2>Planning Your Survey</h2>
		<div class="learn">
			<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will design a more sophisticated research question on a topic that interests you, and you will create tools to gather data and analyze the results.</p>
			<p><strong>In this activity,</strong> you will choose a research question and design and set up your survey.</p>

		<h3>Designing Your Research Plan</h3>
		<p>In <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U1/L3/01-gathering-data.html?topic=middle-school%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 3: Dealing with Data">Lab 3: Dealing with Data</a>, you created a survey with one question and collected data about one variable such as favorite ice cream flavor, music genre, fruit, sport, pizza topping, etc., and you created a pictograph of the results.</p>
		<p>You've learned a lot since then, and you can now research a topic that will require multiple survey questions to investigate how <em>two</em> (or more) variables are related. And you can use Snap<em>!</em> to process the results for you.</p>

				<li>
					Design a research question to investigate the relationship between two (or more) variables, and design your survey questions. Your survey should:
					<ol>
						<li>Have one question to collect data about each variable you are investigating</li>
						<li>Take numbers as responses to at least one question</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="endnote" style="clear: both;">
						<p>
							<em>Example Research Question:</em> Do people stick with some sports longer than other sports?
							<ul>
								<li><em>Possible Variables:</em> sport played, years spent playing sport</li>
								<li><em>Possible Survey Questions:</em>
									<ul>
										<li>What sport do you practice most?</li>
										<li>How many years have you been practicing that sport?</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
							<!--<li>
								<em>Do students do more extracurricular activities in certain grades?</em>
								<ul>
									<li>You could survey people about <em>how many extracurricular activities people do</em> and <em>what grade they are in</em>.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								<em>How does time it takes to get to school impact when people wake up?</em>
								<ul>
									<li>You could survey people about <em>how long it takes them to get to school</em> and <em>what time they wake up</em>.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>-->
						<p>
							<em>Example Research Question:</em> Do people who have practiced music longer listen to more music?
							<ul>
								<li><em>Possible Variables:</em> years spent playing music, hours spent listening to music each day</li>
								<li><em>Possible Survey Questions:</em>
									<ul>
										<li>How many years have you been playing music?</li>
										<li>How many hours do you listen to music each day?</li>

			In upcoming activities, you will learn about and create tools that allow Snap<em>!</em> to:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Process only data matching a certain condition (such as if a response equals a certain value or is greater than or less than some value)<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/keep-soccer.png" alt="keep items (() = soccer) from 'list input slot'" title="keep items (() = soccer) from 'list input slot'" />

The <code>or</code> block checks both conditions.-->
					The <code>is survey (my survey) not set up?</code> block takes a list as input and reports true if <em>either</em> of the following are true:
					<ul>
						<li>The value stored in <var>my survey</var> is <em>not</em> a list</li>
						<li>The value stored in <var>my survey</var> is an <em>empty</em> list</li>

					The <code>make survey with questions</code> block takes a set of questions as input and reports a list containing one item: the list of questions. So, it sets up a table for the survey data as a list with one row containing the list of questions.

				<p>Like the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join.png" alt="join () ()" title="join () ()" /> and <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/list-full-size.png" alt="list ()" title="list ()" /> blocks, you can add an input slot to <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/make-survey.png" alt="make survey with questions ()" title="make survey with questions ()" /> by clicking the right-facing triangle at the end (▸).</p>

						<p>The <code>reset survey</code> block takes a survey as input. If the response to "Are you sure" is "yes," then everything in the survey is deleted. Otherwise (that is, if there is any other response to the question), the sprite says "Survey not changed."</p>
