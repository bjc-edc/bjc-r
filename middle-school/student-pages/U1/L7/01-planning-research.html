		<h2>Planning Your Survey</h2>
		<div class="learn">
			<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will design a more sophisticated research question on a topic that interests you, and you will create tools to gather data and analyze the results.</p>
			<p><strong>In this activity,</strong> you will choose a research question and design and set up your survey.</p>

		<h3>Designing a Research Plan</h3>
		<p>In <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U1/L3/01-gathering-data.html?topic=middle-school%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 3: Dealing with Data">Lab 3: Dealing with Data</a>, you created a survey with one question and collected data about one variable such as favorite ice cream flavor, music genre, fruit, sport, pizza topping, etc., and you created a pictograph of the results.</p>
                <div class="comment">Do middle schoolers learn the terminology of "single-variable" vs "multi-variable" statistics/charts? I didn't think they did, and I'm concerned that the use of the term variable here might be overly confusing, especially when we introduce another meaning of variable soon. (And yes the terms are related, but I find they are different enough that I usually don't try hard to connect the math term to the programming term). What about a term like question, answer, option, etc? - PF 11/27</div>

		<p>You've learned a lot since then, and you can now research a topic that will require multiple survey questions to investigate how <em>two</em> (or more) variables are related. And you can use Snap<em>!</em> to process the results for you.</p>

					Design a research question to investigate the relationship between two (or more) variables, and design your survey questions. Your survey should:
					<ol>
						<li>Have one question to collect data about each variable you are investigating</li>
						<li>Take numbers as responses to at least one question</li>

		<h3>Designing a Data Processing Strategy</h3>
		<p>
			In upcoming activities, you will learn about and create tools that allow Snap<em>!</em> to:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Process only data matching a certain condition (such as if a response equals a certain value or is greater than or less than some value)<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/keep-soccer.png" alt="keep items (() = soccer) from 'list input slot'" title="keep items (() = soccer) from 'list input slot'" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/keep-gt3.png" alt="keep items (() > 3) from 'list input slot'" title="keep items (() > 3) from 'list input slot'" />
				</li>
				<li>
					Find the length of a list, the sum or average of a list's values, or the maximum or minimum value in a list:<br />
					<img class="smallindent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/length-list.png" alt="length of 'list input slot'" title="length of 'list input slot'" />
					<img class="smallindent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/sum-of-list.png" alt="sum of 'list input slot'" title="sum of 'list input slot'" />

				</li>
			</ul>
                        <div class="comment">I'm a little confused seeing the length block here, since it's different from the built-in length block. Perhaps that will be cleared up in a future activity (perhaps a "list" is more than just a Snap list). -PF 11/27</div>

					Come up with an overall strategy for using those Snap<em>!</em> blocks to investigate your question. 
					If you realize your survey questions can't be researched using those blocks, you should redesign your survey before you go on.

	        <div class="comment">I wonder if students will get confused between "research question" and "survey questions" here, since they're both "questions". I don't have a clearer wording suggestion however, just noting that it could happen. I suspect "research question" will be fuzzier in their head. - PF 11/27</div>
