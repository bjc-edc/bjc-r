		<h2>Visualizing and Reflecting on Your Results</h2>
		<div class="learn"><p>In this activity, you'll see what other questions you can explore about your investigation topic, create a visualization, and reflect on your results.</p></div>
		
		<h3>Asking Additional Questions</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Review what you have learned about your investigation and see if you can generate any other interesting questions to explore using the functions you've explored Snap<em>!</em>.</li>
				<li>Open your "Data Dos" project if it isn't open already. Then answer your additional questions using Snap<em>!</em>.</li>				 
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Importing Blocks from Another Project</h3>
		<p>
			In Snap<em>!</em>, you can use blocks that you've created in previous projects. For example, these data visualization tools from your first data project might be useful:
			<ul>
				<li>
					The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab03/count-data.png" alt="count data 'list input slot'" title="count data 'list input slot'" /> block counts the number of times each word appears in a list. You can use it to count the number of each type (category) of response to a question.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/count-data-reporting.png" alt="count data: (responses to question (1) from survey (my survey)) reporting a table with two colums and two rows. Row 1 as the values 'soccer' and '2'. Row 2 as the values 'basketball' and '1'." title="count data: (responses to question (1) from survey (my survey)) reporting a table with two colums and two rows. Row 1 as the values 'soccer' and '2'. Row 2 as the values 'basketball' and '1'." />
				</li>
				<li>
					The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab03/sort-data.png" alt="sort data: 'list input slot' by: ('largest to smallest')" title="sort data: 'list input slot' by: ('largest to smallest')" /> block orders values from largest to smallest, smallest to largest values, or alphabetically.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/sort-data-reporting.png" alt="sort data: (count data: (responses to question (1) from survey (my survey))) by: ('alphabetical A-Z') reporting a table with two colums and two rows. Row 1 as the values 'basketball' and '1'. Row 2 as the values 'soccer' and '2'." title="sort data: (count data: (responses to question (1) from survey (my survey))) by: ('alphabetical A-Z') reporting a table with two colums and two rows. Row 1 as the values 'basketball' and '1'. Row 2 as the values 'soccer' and '2'." />
				</li>
				<li>
					The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab03/draw-pictograph.png" alt="draw pictograph with emoji: () title: () counts: ()" title="draw pictograph with emoji: () title: () counts: ()" /> block takes an emoji, title, and list of category counts as input and draws a pictograph of the category count data using the emoji as the picture and putting the title on the vertical axis.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/draw-pictograph-example.png" alt="draw pictograph with emoji: ('soccer ball emoji') title: ('favorite sports') counts: (sort data: (count data: (responses to question (1) from survey (my survey))) by: ('alphabetical A-Z'))" title="draw pictograph with emoji: ('soccer ball emoji') title: ('favorite sports') counts: (sort data: (count data: (responses to question (1) from survey (my survey))) by: ('alphabetical A-Z'))" />
					<img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/soccer-pictograph.png" alt="pictograph with soccer balls; the vertical axis is labeled 'favorite sports' and the categories along on the horizontal axis are 'basketball' showing 1 soccer ball, and 'soccer' showing 2 soccer balls" title="pictograph with soccer balls; the vertical axis is labeled 'favorite sports' and the categories along on the horizontal axis are 'basketball' showing 1 soccer ball, and 'soccer' showing 2 soccer balls" />
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>To use blocks from another project, you must first export them from the project where you built them and then import them into your current project.</p>
	
		<div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="3">
				<li>
					<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/export-blocks-dialog-box.png" alt="Export blocks' dialog box showing four blocks: draw pictograph with emojis: () title: () counts: 'list input slot'; count data 'list input slot'; split lines (); and sort data 'list input slot' by (). All blocks have a checkmark beside them except for split lines (). There are 'OK' and 'Cancel' buttons at the bottom." title="Export blocks' dialog box showing four blocks: draw pictograph with emojis: () title: () counts: 'list input slot'; count data 'list input slot'; split lines (); and sort data 'list input slot' by (). All blocks have a checkmark beside them except for split lines (). There are 'OK' and 'Cancel' buttons at the bottom." />
					Export the blocks from your previous project.
					<ol>
						<li>Save any changes to your "Data Dos" project, and open your "Visualizing Data" project.</li>
						<li>Choose "Export blocks..." from the Snap<em>!</em> file menu (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
                            <li>Deselect any block(s) you don't need such as the <code>split lines</code> block. </li>
                            <li>Click "OK." An XML file will download to your computer.</li>
					</ol>
                </li>
                <li>
					Import these blocks into your current project.
					<ol>
						<li>Open your "Data Dos" project again.</li>
						<li>Drag the XML file that downloaded into the Snap<em>!</em> window to import it.</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="endnote">
						<p>If you see a message when you try to import that asks "Replace the current project with a new one?" it means that you exported a whole project instead of just its blocks. Click "No," and try exporting from "Data Dos" again.</p>
                		<p>It won't happen here, but if you ever see <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/obsolete.png" alt="obsolete" title="obsolete" /> inside an imported block, it means a required block is missing. Delete the imported block, open the original project, and export again selecting all the blocks used inside the block you want.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					Select a survey question for your pictograph, and use <code>count data</code> together with <code>draw pictograph</code> to create your visualization.
					<div class="endnote">If your <var>my survey</var> watcher is in the way of your pictograph, you can move it, shrink it by dragging its lower right corner, or hide it by deselecting its checkbox in the palette on the left of the Snap<em>!</em> window.</div>
				</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Is there anything new that you notice looking at your data in this format?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        

		<h3>Reflecting on Your Results</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">

						<li>Who might benefit from this information?</li>
						<li>What other questions did your research raise about this topic?</li>
						<li>How would your analysis change if you could survey 10,000 people with these questions?</li>
						<li>What other Snap<em>!</em> tools could you build that would be helpful to research?</li>
						<li>What other kinds of graphs would help visualize your data?</li>
						<li>What other topics would you like to research in the future?</li>

            <p>In this activity, you expanded your data investigation by asking additional questions, imported visualization tools from your prior data project, and discussed possible extensions to your research.</p>
