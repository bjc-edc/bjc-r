		<h2>Setting Up Your Survey</h2>
		<div class="learn">
            <p>In this activity, you will begin creating your survey in Snap<em>!</em> by adding your questions.</p>

					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/initialize-survey.png" alt="if (survey (my survey) is not set up?) {
	set (my survey) to (make survey with questions ())

			<p>A <strong>variable</strong> is like a box that can store a value, such as a word, a number, or a list.</p>
			<p>In Snap<em>!</em>, a <strong>table</strong> is a list of lists (a list with lists inside it).</p>

			This script:

				<li>Uses a variable called <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/my-survey.png" alt="my survey" title="my survey" /> to store survey questions and responses</li>
				<li>Checks whether <var>my survey</var> is already set up so it doesn't erase a survey you've already started </li>
				<li>Sets up a <em>table</em> with the questions as the first row if <var>my survey</var> is <em>not</em> set up</li>
			</ul>

					The <code>survey () is not set up?</code> block takes a list as input and reports true if <em>either</em> of the following are true:
					<ul>
						<li>The value stored in <var>my survey</var> is <em>not</em> a list</li>
						<li>The value stored in <var>my survey</var> is an <em>empty</em> list</li>

					The <code>make survey with questions</code> block takes a set of questions as input and reports a list containing one item: the list of questions. So, it sets up a table for the survey data as a list with one row containing the list of questions.
				</p>
				<p>Like the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join.png" alt="join () ()" title="join () ()" /> and <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/list-full-size.png" alt="list ()" title="list ()" /> blocks, you can add an input slot to <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/make-survey.png" alt="make survey with questions ()" title="make survey with questions ()" /> by clicking the right-facing triangle at the end (▸).</p>

						<p>The <code>reset survey</code> block takes a survey as input. If the response to "Are you sure" is "yes," then everything in the survey is deleted. Otherwise (that is, if there is any other response to the question), the sprite says "Survey not changed."</p>
						<p>You'll need to drag the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/my-survey.png" alt="my survey" title="my survey" /> variable out of the palette on the left and into the empty input slot.</p>

				<p>A <strong>watcher</strong> is a window that lets you see what value is stored in a variable.</p>

			On the Snap<em>!</em> stage, you will see your questions appear as the first row of a table in a <em>watcher</em> for the <code>my survey</code> variable. As you add responses to your survey, they will appear as additional rows in the table.<br />
