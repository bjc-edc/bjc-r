		<h3>Designing Your Research Plan</h3>
		<p>
			In <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U1/L3/01-gathering-data.html?topic=middle-school%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 3: Dealing with Data">Unit 1 Lab 3: Dealing with Data</a>, you created a survey with one question and created a pictograph of the results.

			You've learned a lot since then, and you are now prepared to create a survey with <em>multiple</em> questions and to use Snap<em>!</em> to process the results for you.
		</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<div class="todo">Make a little worksheet to go along with this.</div>
				<li>
					Decide on a research question that you can investigate by surveying your classmates on a topic that interests you. 
					<div class="takeNote">For everyone's privacy, don't choose a research question that will require asking for identifying information that would tell you who answered what on the survey such as name, address, phone number, birthday, student ID number, Snap<em>!</em> username, etc.</div>

Here are some ideas:
							<ul>
								<li>How many favorite musical artist do people have?</li>
								<li>How long have people practiced their favorite sports?</li>
								<li>Do students do more extracurricular activities at certain age?</li>
								<li>How long does it take people to get to school?</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<div class="sidenoteBig">Remember, your survey should be anonymous; it should not collect any personal information.</div>
				<li>
					Design a survey to answer your question. Your survey should:
					<ol>
						<li>Have more than one question</li>
						<li>Take numbers as responses to at least one question</li>

But it's possible that <var>my survey</var> <em>has</em> been set up as a list of lists and then emptied of all it's data (using a <code>reset survey</code> block), so if <var>my survey</var> is an <em>empty</em> list, then <code>is survey (my survey) not set up?</code> should report true in that case too.

								The expression <code>is survey (my survey) not set up?</code> takes a list as input and reports true if either of the following are true:

		<h3><code>Keeping</code> Specific Items from Your List</h3>
		<p>You can already learn some things about the data you have collected by using the <code>keep</code> and <code>length</code> blocks. For example, you might want to know how many students that you surveyed study more than 5 hours a week.
		<div class="todo">
<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/length-of-keep-reporting.png" alt="length of (keep items (( ) > (5)) from (responses to question (2) from (my survey))) reporting 2" title="length of (keep items (( ) > (5)) from (responses to question (2) from (my survey))) reporting 2" /></div>
			(You can use <code>responses to question</code> to select the data for one question, then use <code>keep</code> to select responses meeting a certain criteria.)</p>
			<p>The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/length-list.png" alt="length of 'list input slot'" title="length of 'list input slot'" /> block takes a list as input and reports the length of that list.</p>
		<div class="endnote">
			If the input to <code>length of list</code> is a list of lists, it will report the number of lists in the list. If you want to know the length of one of your lists inside the list, you first need to select the data you want to ask the length of by using <code>responses to question</code>.
		</div>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>Review <code>keep</code> then use it for what's the average GPA for students who study more than 10 hours a week? What's the average GPA for students who study less than 10 hours per week?</p>
			<p>Also: What's the maximum GPA for students in your group? What's the maximum number of hours studied?</p>

		<h3><code>Combining</code> Elements of a List</h3>
		<p>You can use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/combine.png" alt="combine 'list input slot' using 'reporter input slot'" title="combine 'list input slot' using 'reporter input slot'" /> to apply the <code>join</code> function to all the elements in a list.</p>
		
		
		<p> The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/combine.png" alt="combine 'list input slot' using 'reporter input slot'" title="combine 'list input slot' using 'reporter input slot'" /> block takes two inputs: a list and an operation <em>with two inputs</em>, and it reports the result of combining all the elements in the input list using the input operation. For example, the expression below reports: 0 + 1 + 2.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine-simple-example.png" alt="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3" title="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3" />
        </p>
        
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p><strong>You choose the operation, and <code>combine</code> performs that operation by <em>combining</em> all the items in the input list and then reports the result.</strong></p>
            <p>Notice that the function used to <em>combine</em> the list items always has two blank input slots. The <code>keep</code> block only needs one blank in its input function, but with <code>combine</code>, two are required.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p><code>Combine</code> is a <em>higher order function</em>; it is a function that takes a function as input.

			It can also be helpful to be able to find the maximum or minimum value in a list. You can use <code>combine</code> to do that, but you'll need to create these functions first:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/maximum.png" alt="maximum of () and ()" title="maximum of () and ()" />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/minimum.png" alt="minimum of () and ()" title="minimum of () and ()" /><br />
			These blocks should take two inputs, check which input value is greater (or lesser), and then decide report one of the two input values.

                            The function has to be <em>associative</em>, meaning that it can't matter what order you group the items in. For example, addition is associative: (7&thinsp;+&thinsp;8)&thinsp;+&thinsp;1 is the same as 7&thinsp;+&thinsp;(8&thinsp;+&thinsp;1) (work it out yourself), but subtraction is not: (7&thinsp;−&thinsp;8)&thinsp;−&thinsp;1 is different from 7&thinsp;−&thinsp;(8&thinsp;−&thinsp;1).
                            So expressions like <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine-minus.png" alt="combine with (-) items of (list 7 8 1)"> would be ambiguous.
