		<h3>Designing Your Research Plan</h3>
		<p>Discuss the general premise and how this lab differs from <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U1/L3/01-gathering-data.html?topic=middle-school%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html">1.3</a>.</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<div class="todo">Make a little worksheet to go along with this.</div>
				<li>
					Decide on a research question that you can investigate by surveying your classmates on a topic that interests you. 
					<div class="endnote">
						<p>Since <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U1/L3/01-gathering-data.html?topic=middle-school%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 3 Activity 1: Gathering Data">Lab 3</a>, you have developed stronger Snap<em>!</em> skills; so you can research a topic that will require multiple survey questions to investigate <em>and</em> you can use Snap<em>!</em> to do math for you. Here are some ideas:
							<ul>
								<li>How many favorite musical artist do people have?</li>
								<li>How long have people practiced their favorite sports?</li>
								<li>Do students do more extracurricular activities at certain age?</li>
								<li>How long does it take people to get to school?</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="takeNote">For everyone's privacy, don't choose a research question that will require asking for identifying information that would tell you who answered what on the survey such as name, address, phone number, birthday, student ID number, Snap<em>!</em> username, etc.</div>
				</li>
				<li>design a survey to answer your question. Your survey should:
					<ul>
						<li>have more than one question</li>
						<li>takes numbers for responses to at least one question</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="endnote">Your survey should be anonymous. That means it should not collect any personal information (such as names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.)</div>
				</li>
			</ol>

		<h3>Collecting and Storing Your Data</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">

		<h3>Accessing Data in a Table</h3>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll build code for blocks to help you access specific data from your table so that you can analyze it to answer your research questions.</div>
        <p>As you process the data you have collected, it will be helpful to have a way to separate the questions stored in the first row of the table from the survey responses in the rows below.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<div class="todo">Add examples</div>
				<li>
					The following two blocks are in your project, but they don't do anything yet. Edit them, and create code to make them work as described below.
					<ol>
						<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/questions-only.png" alt="questions only from survey 'list input slot'" title="questions only from survey 'list input slot'" /> should take survey data as input and report the first row of data in the table.</li>

		<h4>How to <code>Combine</code> Elements of a List</h4>
		<p>You can use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/combine.png" alt="combine 'list input slot' using 'reporter input slot'" title="combine 'list input slot' using 'reporter input slot'" /> to apply the <code>join</code> function to all the elements in a list.</p>
		
		
		<p> The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/combine.png" alt="combine 'list input slot' using 'reporter input slot'" title="combine 'list input slot' using 'reporter input slot'" /> block takes two inputs: a list and an operation <em>with two inputs</em>, and it reports the result of combining all the elements in the input list using the input operation. For example, the expression below reports: 0 + 1 + 2.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine-simple-example.png" alt="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3" title="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3" />
        </p>
        
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p><strong>You choose the operation, and <code>combine</code> performs that operation by <em>combining</em> all the items in the input list and then reports the result.</strong></p>
            <p>Notice that the function used to <em>combine</em> the list items always has two blank input slots. The <code>keep</code> block only needs one blank in its input function, but with <code>combine</code>, two are required.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p><code>Combine</code> is a <em>higher order function</em>; it is a function that takes a function as input. You've seen another higher order function already: <code>keep</code> (in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/5-keeping-list-items.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Keeping Items from a List">Unit 2 Lab 3</a>).</p>
            <p>
                Unlike <code>keep</code>, the <code>combine</code> function is only used with a few input functions.
                <a href="#hint-which-functions" data-toggle="collapse" title="Which functions?">Which functions?</a>
                <div id="hint-which-functions" class="collapse">
                    <p>
                        <code>Combine</code> is mostly used with <em>only these functions</em>:<br />

                        and the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/maximum.png" alt="maximum of () ()" title="maximum of () ()" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/minimum.png" alt="minimum of () ()" title="minimum of () ()" /> blocks you've just written yourself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#hint-3">Why so few?</a>
                        <div id="hint-3" class="collapse">
                            The function has to be <em>associative</em>, meaning that it can't matter what order you group the items in. For example, addition is associative: (7&thinsp;+&thinsp;8)&thinsp;+&thinsp;1 is the same as 7&thinsp;+&thinsp;(8&thinsp;+&thinsp;1) (work it out yourself), but subtraction is not: (7&thinsp;−&thinsp;8)&thinsp;−&thinsp;1 is different from 7&thinsp;−&thinsp;(8&thinsp;−&thinsp;1).
                            So expressions like <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine-minus.png" alt="combine with (-) items of (list 7 8 1)"> would be ambiguous.
