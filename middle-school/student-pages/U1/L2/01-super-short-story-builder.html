		<h3>Playing with a Story Builder</h3>

				<div class="todo">
					<p>We still need to Parsons-ize this XML and load it into /prog. (It needs <code>super short story</code>, all 7 red custom <code>random</code> blocks---including random animal---, <code>pick random</code>, <code>join</code>, and <code>join words</code>. ) --MF, 8/13/21</p>
					<p>The join words is a custom block, right? Should we call that out? Also, it has a huge unused part when you edit it, can we trash that so it's cleaner? -- PF 8/20/21</p>
				</div>
				<li>Open this <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=mfries&ProjectName=BJCMS%20-%20Super%20Short%20Stories%20(starter%20project)&editMode" title="Super Short Stories project" target="_blank">Super Short Stories</a> project.</li>
				<li>
					Click the <code>Super Short Story</code> block, and read the bubble that appears.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/super-short-story.png" alt="Super Short Story, feeling: (happy) job: (teacher) action: (jumps) place: (Central Park) action: (races) number: (7) color: (red) plural animal: (cats) food: (stir fry)" title="Super Short Story, feeling: (happy) job: (teacher) action: (jumps) place: (Central Park) action: (races) number: (7) color: (red) plural animal: (cats) food: (stir fry)" />
				</li>
				<li>Change some of the inputs to the <code>Super Short Story</code> block, and click it again.</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />What happens to the story reported in the bubble? </li><li>
					Find one of these <code>random</code> blocks in the palette on the left side of the screen, and click it several times.<br />

					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/random-job.png" alt="random job" title="random job" />

				<li>These blocks don't take any inputs, but since they are reporters, they still report an output. <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> The <code>super short story</code> block always reports the same thing if given the same inputs. What do these blocks report? </li>
				<li>
					Drag some of the <code>random</code> blocks into the <code>Super Short Story</code> block, and run the <code>Super Short Story</code> block a few times.<br />

		<h3>Editing a Block</h3>
		<p>Some blocks are built into Snap<em>!</em> and can't be changed, but Snap<em>!</em> programmers (including you!) can also make and edit their own custom blocks. The <code>random</code> blocks in this project are custom blocks that you can edit.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="9">
				<li>
					Choose one of the <code>random</code> blocks (<code>random feeling</code>, <code>random job</code>, <code>random action</code>, etc.), right-click it, and select "editâ€¦" from the menu that appears.
					<div class="endnote">
						<strong>Tips:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>On a Mac, you can right-click by pressing the 'control' key and clicking.</li>
							<li>
								<a href="#hint-edit" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an image that shows how to open the 'Block Editor.'">Click for an image that shows how to open the "Block Editor."</a>
								<div id="hint-edit" class="collapse"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/edit-block-in-dropdown.jpg" alt="'random feeling' block with right-click menu open and the 'edit...' option at the very bottom of the menu highlighted" title="'random feeling' block with right-click menu open and the 'edit...' option at the very bottom of the menu highlighted" /></div>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			This custom block reports a random item from a list of jobs.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/random-job-block-editor.png" alt="random job: {report (item (random) of (list (artist) (computer programmer) (cashier) (musician) (landscaper) (nurse) (plumber)))}" title="random job: {report (item (random) of (list (artist) (computer programmer) (cashier) (musician) (landscaper) (nurse) (plumber)))}" />
		</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="10">
				<li>
					Change some of the items in the list for the block you are editing. (That is, change some of the colors to other colors, some of the jobs to other jobs, or some of the places to other places, etc.)
					<div class="endnote"><strong>Tip:</strong> You can add additional items to the list or reduce the number of items in the list by clicking the arrows at the end of the list block (&#9668; &#9658;).</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					When you are finished, click the "OK" button, and try clicking the block that you edited several times to make sure that it reports a random item from the list you edited.
					<div class="endnote"><strong>Tip:</strong> If it doesn't work right, edit the block again and also edit another one of the <code>random</code> blocks at the same time. Compare the code for your edited <code>random</code> block that isn't working with the <code>random</code> block that is working.</div>
				</li>
				<li>Once you have a working revision to a <code>random</code> block, try it out in your <code>Super Short Story</code> block.</li>
				<li>Edit a few other <code>random</code> blocks to customize the story further.</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work" /></li>
			</ol>
