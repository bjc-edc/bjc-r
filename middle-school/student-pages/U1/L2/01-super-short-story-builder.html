		<h2>Super-Short Story Builder</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll use functions to write one-sentence stories.</div>
		
		<h3>Play with a Super-Short Story Builder</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Open this <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=mfries&ProjectName=BJCMS%20-%20Super%20Short%20Stories%20(starter%20project)&editMode" title="Super Short Stories project" target="_blank">Super Short Stories</a> project.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Every Snap<em>!</em> program is made up of <em>blocks</em>, and those blocks tell the computer what to do. There are lots of blocks in Snap<em>!</em>, and you can even make your own blocks. For this first project, we're hiding most of the blocks, but there is one already in the <em>Scripts</em> area (the central space of the Snap<em>!</em> window) for you to play with.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>
					Click the <code>Super Short Story</code> block, and read the bubble that appears.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/super-short-story.png" alt="Super Short Story, feeling: (happy) job: (teacher) action: (jumps) place: (Central Park) action: (races) number: (7) color: (red) plural animal: (cats) food: (stir fry)" title="Super Short Story, feeling: (happy) job: (teacher) action: (jumps) place: (Central Park) action: (races) number: (7) color: (red) plural animal: (cats) food: (stir fry)" />
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>There are multiple types of blocks in Snap. This <code>Super Short Story</code> block is a <em>reporter</em> block. That means that it does some sort of computation and then "reports" the result to the rest of the program. In Snap<em>!</em> reporter blocks are oval-shaped.</p>
		<p>
			When you click a block, the computer runs its code. You'll see the code behind this block in an upcoming activity. For now, notice that when you click the block, you see the reported result in a bubble, like this:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/super-short-story-reporting.png" alt="Super Short Story, feeling: (happy) job: (teacher) action: (jumps) place: (Central Park) action: (races) number: (7) color: (red) plural animal: (cats) food: (stir fry) reporting 'The happy teacher jumps through Central Park and races over 7 red cats eating stir fry.'" title="Super Short Story, feeling: (happy) job: (teacher) action: (jumps) place: (Central Park) action: (races) number: (7) color: (red) plural animal: (cats) food: (stir fry) reporting 'The happy teacher jumps through Central Park and races over 7 red cats eating stir fry.'" />
		</p>
		<p>Many blocks accept <em>input parameters</em> that customize what they compute, and those parameters show up as blank boxes. This block reports a story based on the input parameters (a feeling, a job, a verb, etc.). You can change the inputs to change the output (in this case, the story).</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>Change some of the input parameters to the <code>Super Short Story</code> block, and click it again.</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />What happens to the story in the bubble? </li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Snapping Blocks Together</h3>
		<p>
			Snap<em>!</em> is called Snap<em>!</em> because you can <em>snap</em> blocks together. Here a <code>random feeling</code> block that has been snapped into the <code>Super Short Story</code> block.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/super-short-story-random-feeling.png" alt="Super Short Story, feeling: (random feeling) job: (teacher) action: (jumps) place: (Central Park) action: (races) number: (7) color: (red) plural animal: (cats) food: (stir fry)" title="Super Short Story, feeling: (random feeling) job: (teacher) action: (jumps) place: (Central Park) action: (races) number: (7) color: (red) plural animal: (cats) food: (stir fry)" />
		</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>
					Find one of these random blocks in the palette on the left side of the screen, and click it several times.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/random-feeling.png" alt="random feeling" title="random feeling" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/random-job.png" alt="random job" title="random job" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/random-action.png" alt="random action" title="random action" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/random-place.png" alt="random place" title="random place" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/random-color.png" alt="random color" title="random color" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/random-food.png" alt="random food" title="random food" />
				</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> What was reported?</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>These blocks don't take any input parameters, but since they are reporters, they still report an output. You can use the output of one block as the input to another block.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="7">
				<li>Drag some of the <code>random</code> blocks into the <code>Super Short Story</code> block, and click the block a few times.</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> What happens to the story reported by the block?</li>
				<li>Make sure you are logged in to Snap<em>!</em> by checking that your name appears in the Snap<em>!</em> Cloud menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" alt="cloud menu button" title="cloud menu button" />).</li>
				<li>Save this project to your Snap<em>!</em> account by choosing "Save" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (it looks like a piece of paper with a corner folded: <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Be sure to save your projects after an important change to your project and, if you are using a shared computer, whenever you're done for the day.</p>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned how to run a block by clicking it and how to change a block's input parameters by typing different text into the input slots or by dragging other blocks into the input slots. You've seen that, either way, changing the inputs that are given to a function will change the output that it reports.</div>
