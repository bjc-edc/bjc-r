		<h2>Super Short Story Builder</h2>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>For next revision: consider making shorter stories with fewer inputs per teacher feedback on <a href="https://piazza.com/class/h8yx482idav52y?cid=3568" title="https://piazza.com/class/h8yx482idav52y?cid=3568" target="_blank">https://piazza.com/class/h8yx482idav52y?cid=3568</a>. --MF, 8/18/21</p>
			<p>Also, split this page into 2 pages, the next page into 3 pages, and the last into 2 pages ("Editing the Story Structure" and "Saving and Sharing Your Snap<em>!</em> Project"). We need to teach sharing early. --MF, 12/28/21</p>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll use functions to write one-sentence stories.</div>

				<li>These blocks don't take any inputs, but they are reporters, which means they still report an output.<div class="todo">Used to say "since they are reporters" -- I haven't looked at the TG. Do kids know what reporters are? Do teachers? The key word here is "since," which seems to imply we already know that they are. How would <em>novices</em> know? Since this is not a framework-driven course (like CSP), it would be nice if teachers could learn basically from the same curriculum that faces the kids, even though there will (and should) be PD. We want the kids and teachers to learn terms like "reporter," best done from use in context, but might need a bit more context to use them here. --P</div> <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> The <code>super short story</code> block always reports the same thing if given<div class="todo">"if given" -- I'm not an expert on ELs in middle school, but the curriculum should be read by someone who is. My guess is that the syntax (e.g., here with "if given") will be challenging. Some of the vocab will be too, of course, but we want students to learn that (and some will be equally new to all students). Just thinking about extra burdens for EL students. --P </div> the same inputs. What do these blocks report? </li>
				<li>
					Drag some of the <code>random</code> blocks into the <code>Super Short Story</code> block, and run the <code>Super Short Story</code> block a few times.<br />

		<h3>Editing a Block</h3>
		<p>Some blocks are built into Snap<em>!</em> and can't be changed, but Snap<em>!</em> programmers (including you!) can also make and edit their own custom blocks. The <code>random</code> blocks in this project are custom blocks that you can edit.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="9">
				<li>
					Choose one of the <code>random</code> blocks (<code>random feeling</code>, <code>random job</code>, <code>random action</code>, etc.), right-click it (or control-click it, if you're on a Mac), and select "editâ€¦" from the menu that appears.
					<div class="endnote">
						<strong>Tip:</strong>
 								<a href="#hint-edit" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an image that shows how to open the 'Block Editor.'">Click for an image that shows how to open the "Block Editor."</a>
								<div id="hint-edit" class="collapse"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab02/edit-block-in-dropdown.jpg" alt="'random feeling' block with right-click menu open and the 'edit...' option at the very bottom of the menu highlighted" title="'random feeling' block with right-click menu open and the 'edit...' option at the very bottom of the menu highlighted" /></div>
					</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			This custom block reports a random item from a list of jobs.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab02/random-job-block-editor.png" alt="random job: {report (item (random) of (list (artist) (computer programmer) (cashier) (musician) (landscaper) (nurse) (plumber)))}" title="random job: {report (item (random) of (list (artist) (computer programmer) (cashier) (musician) (landscaper) (nurse) (plumber)))}" />
		</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="10">
				<li>
					Change some of the items in the list for the block you are editing. (That is, change some of the colors to other colors, some of the jobs to other jobs, or some of the places to other places, etc.)
					<div class="endnote"><strong>Tip:</strong> You can also <em>add</em> more items to the list or reduce the number of items in the list by clicking the arrows at the end of the list block (&#9668; &#9658;).</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					When you are finished editing, click the "OK" button, and click the block that you edited several times to make sure that it reports a random item from the list you edited.
					<div class="endnote"><strong>Tip:</strong> If it doesn't work right, edit the block again and also edit another one of the <code>random</code> blocks at the same time. Compare the code for your edited <code>random</code> block that isn't working with the <code>random</code> block that is working.</div>
				</li>
				<li>Once you have a working revision to a <code>random</code> block, try it out in your <code>Super Short Story</code> block.</li>
				<li>Edit a few other <code>random</code> blocks to customize the story further.</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work" /></li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you used randomness to make a story more interesting and edited lists inside custom blocks.</div>
