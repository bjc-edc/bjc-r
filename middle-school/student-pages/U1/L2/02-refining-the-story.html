		<h2>Refining the Story</h2>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>There were a lot of fill-in-the-blank prompts in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12GtjpO8cawrWDrR-qTwy4kRTn3M4kF6WW-hW_x7JWtk/edit" title="Activity 2: Refining the Story Google Doc" target="_blank">Refining the Story Google Doc</a>. How are we going to handle that for the HTML version? --MF, 8/11/21</p>
		</div>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll use operator functions to generate random numbers and to join letters together to make new words to improve the story.</div>

		<h3>Using a Random Number</h3>
		<p>
			Notice that the input slot for numbers is a different shape. In Snap<em>!</em>, the shape of an input slot tells you what kind of input you can put in that slot. A rectangle will accept any kind of text (letters, numbers, punctuation, emojis, etc.), but an oval will only accept a number. <br />

		</p>
		<p>You've used special <code>random</code> blocks that were designed especially for this project to generate random feelings, jobs, actions, places, etc. Programming languages (like Snap<em>!</em>) have a built-in way to generate random numbers.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Log in to Snap<em>!</em> and open your "BJCMS - Super Short Stories" project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
				<li>Locate the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-1-to-10-full-size.png" alt="pick random (1) to (10)" title="pick random (1) to (10)" /> block in the Operators palette on the left hand side of the Snap<em>!</em> window, and click it a few times.</li>
				<li>Change the inputs to the <code>pick random number</code> block a few times and each time you do, click it a few times to see what happens.</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Describe what the pick random number block does.</li>
				<li>Drag the <code>pick random number</code> block into the <code>Super Short Story</code> block, and run that block a few times to verify that a random number is used in the story. If it isn't working right, work with another student to sort out the problem.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Editing the Inputs with <code>Join</code></h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="6">
				<li>If you haven't used the <code>random animal</code> block, try it in the <code>Super Short Story</code> block now. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair.png" alt="Talk with Another Pair" title="Talk with Another Pair" /> What is a potential problem with using this block in this story?</li>
				<li>Find the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join()().png" alt="join" title="join" /> block in the palette and drag it into the Scripts area. Click it, change the inputs, and click it again. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />What does the <code>join</code> block do?</li>
				<li>
					Drag the <code>random animal</code> block into the first slot of the <code>join</code> block and type an "s" in the second slot. Click it to test that it reports a plural animal, and then drag the entire <code>join</code> expression into the <code>Super Short Story</code> block.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/join-random-animal-s.png" alt="join (random animal) (s)" title="join (random animal) (s)" />
				</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work" /></li>
				<li>Share your project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>), selecting this project from the list, pressing "Share," and clicking "Cancel". Then copy the URL (web address) out of the location bar at the top of the window, and send it to your friends, family, and/or teacher.</li>
			</ol>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned how to generate random numbers and how to join strings of text to refine the story outputted by the <code>Super Short Story</code> block.</div>
