		<h2>Creating and Editing Blocks</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll edit the structure of the story itself to make it your own story.</div>

		<h3>Editing the Story Structure</h3>
		<p>The <code>join</code> block joins two strings of text into one (without a space), and you used to create a plural word. There is also a <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join-words().png" alt="join words ()" title="join words ()" /> block that joins strings of text <em>with</em> a space between them.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab02/join-short-story-reporting.png" alt="'join (short) (story)' reporting 'shortstory'" title="'join (short) (story)' reporting 'shortstory'" />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab02/join-words-short-story-reporting.png" alt="'join words (short) (story)' reporting 'short story'" title="'join words (short) (story)' reporting 'short story'" />
		</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em> and open your "Super Short Stories" project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
				<li>Right-click the <code>super short story</code> block, and select "editâ€¦" from the menu that appears.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			Just as in the <code>plural</code> block, the <code>super short story</code> hat block at the top shows you the structure of the block that will be visible from the outside, including the name of any inputs (<var>feeling</var>,  <var>job</var>, <var>action 1</var>, <var>place</var>, <var>action 2</var>, etc.).<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab02/super-short-story-block-editor.png" alt="Super Short Story, feeling: (feeling) job: (job) action: (action 1) place: (place) action: (action 2) number: (number #) color: (color) plural animal: (animals) food: (food): {report (join words ('The') (feeling) (job) (action 1) ('through') (place) ('and') (action 2) ('over') (number) (color) (animals) ('eating') (food))}" title="Super Short Story, feeling: (feeling) job: (job) action: (action 1) place: (place) action: (action 2) number: (number #) color: (color) plural animal: (animals) food: (food): {report (join words ('The') (feeling) (job) (action 1) ('through') (place) ('and') (action 2) ('over') (number) (color) (animals) ('eating') (food))}" /><br />
			As before, the code inside the <code>report</code> block controls what is reported when the block is run. These inputs have already been dragged into the code for the block.
		</p>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Local Variables</strong>
		  <p>Block inputs (such as <var>feeling</var>,  <var>job</var>, <var>action 1</var>, <var>place</var>, <var>action 2</var>, etc., in the <code>super short story</code> example) are called <strong>local variables</strong> because the value they report to <code>join words</code> <em>varies</em> based on what is typed into the input slots of <code>super short story</code>, but they only can be used in this <em>local</em> context (you can't drag them out of the block editor and expect them to work in other parts of your code).</p>
		  <div class="todo">Should this mention that block/script local is different from sprite local? -bh 2/6/22</div>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Discuss the code inside the <code>report</code> block and how it works to create the output of <code>super short story</code>.</li>
				<li>On paper, write out a single-sentence story, select several words to remove, and for each removed word, write the name of a category of words that could replace that word (for example, "feeling" could replace "happy" and "job" could replace "teacher"). Make a list of these categories so you have their names in order.</li>
				<div class="commentBig">This needs an animation; even a great picture really won't do it as well as an animation would. I need help here. :) --MF, 8/16/21
					<p>Can we just do a short movie? Animated GIFs aren't great usability wise since you can't replay/pause/etc. --PF 8/20/21</p>
					<p>We have a JS script so they can be paused. I'm not against movies in theory, and I can't recall exactly why we've opted against them, but it might have been usability. Videos have to be hosted somewhere, and if the school restricts domains, then the video might not be visible. Uploading elsewhere also recreates development overhead. That's acceptable when a video is really needed (like 1.1.1) but for something quick like this, a little animated GIF is easier to create and embed as an image. Just a few thoughts. We can discuss further if you like. --MF, 8/20/21
				</div>
				<li>
					Starting at the beginning of the <code>super short story</code> hat block, click each input label (for example, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab02/feeling-label.jpg" alt="'feeling:' label" title="'feeling:' label" />) and change it to your category name, and then click the variable name for that input (for example, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab02/feeling-variable.jpg" alt="'feeling' variable name" title="'feeling' variable name" />) and change that to the same category. Do this for each category in your list.
					<ul>
						<li>If you don't have as many categories as <code>super short story</code> did, click a label or variable and choose "Delete."</li>
						<li>If you have more categories, hold the mouse pointer after the last word in the hat block, and click the plus sign that appears. Then, add text for a label and click "Title text," or add text for a variable and choose "Input name."</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Change the inputs in the <code>join words</code> definition, to change the structure of the story so it matches your single-sentence story. Drag in the local variables where you need them. When you are finished, click "OK," and run the <code>super short story</code> block to test your work.</li>
			</ol>

		<div class="ifTime show">

				<li>
					<div class="comment">To make the color match, choose the "Lists" as the palette in the block editor.</div>
					Make your own <code>random</code> blocks by creating a new reporter block, editing an existing <code>random</code> block at the same time, and copying and changing the code.
					<div class="endnote"><strong>Tip:</strong> You can duplicate a block by right-clicking it, selecting the picture of the block in the menu that appears, and dropping the code attached to your mouse pointer in the desired location.</div>
					<div class="todo">This used to say "selecting 'duplicate,'" but that's true only if the block is the last one in its script.  I understand that that will be the case in these early functional examples, but imho we shouldn't teach wrong things and then have to unteach them later. If y'all agree you can delete this red box. -bh 2/6/22</div>
				</li>
			</ol>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you changed the labels and variables in the <code>super short story</code> block to match the categories in your own story and edited the structure of the story to make it your own.</div>
