		<h2>Creating and Editing Blocks</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll edit the structure of the story itself to make it your own story.</div>

		<h3>Editing the Story Structure</h3>
		<p>The <code>join</code> block joins two strings of text into one (without a space), and you used to create a plural word. There is also a <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join-words().png" alt="join words ()" title="join words ()" /> block that joins strings of text <em>with</em> a space between them.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/join-short-story-reporting.png" alt="'join (short) (story)' reporting 'shortstory'" title="'join (short) (story)' reporting 'shortstory'" />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/join-words-short-story-reporting.png" alt="'join words (short) (story)' reporting 'short story'" title="'join words (short) (story)' reporting 'short story'" />
		</p>
		<div class="comment"><p>The join words is a custom block, right? Should we call that out? Also, it has a huge unused part when you edit it, can we trash that so it's cleaner? -- PF 8/20/21</p></div>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em> and open your "Super Short Stories" project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
				<li>Right-click the <code>super short story</code> block, and select "editâ€¦" from the menu that appears.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			Like for the <code>plural</code> block, the <code>super short story</code> hat block at the top shows you the structure of the block that will be visible from the outside, including the name of any inputs (<var>feeling</var>,  <var>job</var>, <var>action 1</var>, <var>place</var>, <var>action 2</var>, etc.).<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/super-short-story-block-editor.png" alt="Super Short Story, feeling: (feeling) job: (job) action: (action 1) place: (place) action: (action 2) number: (number #) color: (color) plural animal: (animals) food: (food): {report (join words ('The') (feeling) (job) (action 1) ('through') (place) ('and') (action 2) ('over') (number) (color) (animals) ('eating') (food))}" title="Super Short Story, feeling: (feeling) job: (job) action: (action 1) place: (place) action: (action 2) number: (number #) color: (color) plural animal: (animals) food: (food): {report (join words ('The') (feeling) (job) (action 1) ('through') (place) ('and') (action 2) ('over') (number) (color) (animals) ('eating') (food))}" /><br />
			As before, the code inside the <code>report</code> block controls what is reported when block is run. These inputs have already been dragged into the code for the block.
		</p>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Local Variables</strong>
			<p>These inputs (<var>feeling</var>,  <var>job</var>, <var>action 1</var>, <var>place</var>, <var>action 2</var>, etc.) are called <strong>local variables</strong> because the value they report to <code>join words</code> <em>varies</em> based on what is typed into the input slots of <code>super short story</code>, but they only can be used in this <em>local</em> context (you can't drag them out of the block editor and expect them to work in other parts of your code).</p>
		</div>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Discuss the code inside the <code>report</code> block and how it words to create the output of <code>super short story</code>.</li>
				<li>On paper, write out a single-sentence story, select several words to remove, and for each removed word, write the name of a category of words that could replace that word (like how "feeling" could replace "happy" and "job" could replace "teacher). Make a list of these categories so you have their names in order.</li>
				<div class="comment">This needs an animation; even a great picture really won't do it as well as an animation would. I need help here. :) --MF, 8/16/21
					<p>Can we just do a short movie? Animated GIFs aren't great usability wise since you can't replay/pause/etc. --PF 8/20/21</p>
				</div>
				<li>
					Starting at the beginning of the <code>super short story</code> hat block, click each input label (for example, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/feeling-label.jpg" alt="'feeling:' label" title="'feeling:' label" />) and change it to your category name, and then click the variable name for that input (for example, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/feeling-variable.jpg" alt="'feeling' variable name" title="'feeling' variable name" />) and change that to the same category. Do this for each category in your list.
					<ul>
						<li>If you don't have as many categories as <code>super short story</code> did, click a label or variable and choose "Delete."</li>
						<li>If you have more categories, hold the mouse pointer after the last word in the hat block and add text for a label and click "Title text" or add text for a variable and choose "Input name."</li>
						<div class="todo"><p>Isn't it clicking, not holding? This sentence also feels run-on, maybe splice into 2? --PF 8/20/21</p></div>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Change the structure of the inputs to the <code>join words</code> block to change the structure of the story to match your single-sentence story, and drag in the local variables where you need them. When you are finished, click "OK," and run the <code>super short story</code> block to test your work.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="7">
				<li>
					<div class="comment">To make the color match, choose the "Lists" as the palette in the block editor.</div>
					Make your own <code>random</code> blocks by creating a new reporter block, editing an existing <code>random</code> block at the same time, and copying and changing the code.
					<div class="endnote"><strong>Tip:</strong> You can duplicate a block by right-clicking it, selecting "duplicate," and dropping the code attached to your mouse pointer in the desired location.</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you changed the labels and variables in the <code>super short story</code> block to match the categories in your won story and edited the structure of the story to make it your own.</div>
