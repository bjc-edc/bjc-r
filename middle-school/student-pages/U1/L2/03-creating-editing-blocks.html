		<h2>Creating and Editing Blocks</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll edit the structure of the story itself and create your own random blocks.</div>
		
		<h3>Editing a Block</h3>
		<p>Some blocks (like <code>join</code>) are built into Snap<em>!</em> and you can't change them, but Snap<em>!</em> programmers (like you!) can also make and edit their own custom blocks. The <code>random</code> item from a list blocks in this project are custom blocks that you can edit.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>
					Choose one of the <code>random</code> blocks, right-click it, and select "edit…" from the menu that appears.
					<div class="todo">An animation would be nice here when we have time. --MF, 8/11/21</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			This custom block reports a random item from a list of jobs.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/random-job-block-editor.png" alt="random job: {report (item (random) of (list (artist) (computer programmer) (cashier) (musician) (landscaper) (nurse) (plumber)))}" title="random job: {report (item (random) of (list (artist) (computer programmer) (cashier) (musician) (landscaper) (nurse) (plumber)))}" />
		</p>
		
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>Change some of the items in the list for the block you are editing. (That is, change some of the colors to other colors, some of the jobs to other jobs, or some of the places to other places, etc.)</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<p>You can add additional items to the list or reduce the number of items in the list by clicking the arrows at the end of the list block (&#9668; &#9658;).</p>
		
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>When you are finished, click the "OK" button, and try clicking the block that you edited several times to make sure that it reports a random item from the revised list. (If it doesn't work right, edit the block again and also edit another one of the <code>random</code> blocks at the same time. Compare the code for your edited <code>random</code> block that isn't working with the <code>random</code> block that is working.)</li>
				<li>Once you have a working revision to a <code>random</code> block, try it out in your <code>Super Short Story</code> block.</li>
				<li>Edit a few other <code>random</code> blocks to customize your project further.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Editing the Story Structure</h3>
		<p>The <code>join</code> block joins two strings of text into one (without a space), so you can use it to create a plural word. There is also a <c>join words</c> block that joins two strings of text into one <em>with</em> a space between them.</p>
		
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="6">
				<li>Right-click the <code>Super Short Story</code> block, and select "edit…" from the menu that appears.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			The hat block at the top shows you the structure of the block that will be visible from the outside, including the name of any input parameters (<var>feeling</var>,  <var>job</var>, <var>action 1</var>, <var>place</var>, <var>action 2</var>, etc.). The code inside the <code>report</code> block below controls what will be reported when the <code>Super Short Story</code> block is clicked. The input parameters can be dragged into the input slots to the code for the block, and the values that they each report to the <code>join words</code> block will vary based on what is typed into the input slots. These input parameters are called <em>local variables</em> because they vary, but they only can be used in this local context.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/super-short-story-block-editor.png" alt="Super Short Story, feeling: (feeling) job: (job) action: (action 1) place: (place) action: (action 2) number: (number #) color: (color) plural animal: (animals) food: (food): {report (join words ('The') (feeling) (job) (action 1) ('through') (place) ('and') (action 2) ('over') (number) (color) (animals) ('eating') (food))}" title="Super Short Story, feeling: (feeling) job: (job) action: (action 1) place: (place) action: (action 2) number: (number #) color: (color) plural animal: (animals) food: (food): {report (join words ('The') (feeling) (job) (action 1) ('through') (place) ('and') (action 2) ('over') (number) (color) (animals) ('eating') (food))}" />
		</p>
		
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="7">
				<li>Change the structure of the inputs to the <code>join words</code> block to change the structure of the story. When you are finished click "Apply" to save your changes, and click the <code>Super Short Story</code> block to test your work.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<div class="todo">
		<h3>Creating a Block</h3>
		
		Students will also explore creating their own random blocks. You can create one by right-clicking the background of the scripting area, naming a new reporter block, right-clicking to copy the contents of another random block, dragging it in, and editing the contents.
