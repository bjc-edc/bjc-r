					Discuss the growth mindset.<div class="comment">I think that developing/acquiring a growth mindset is enormously important and school often doesn't foster it. My experience in schools, though, is that <em>discussing</em> it becomes basically ritualized propaganda. Many (most?) teachers enter the profession with a fixed mindsetâ€”I was never good at math, that one has a mathematical mind, this one is a born artist. If you don't <em>have</em> a growth mindset yourself, you can't help students develop one, because you basically don't believe the propaganda yourself. Not sure what a <em>solution</em> to this problem is, but I think discussion are just treated by students as "more school blather."</div>
					<ul>
					    <li>When is a time when you used the growth mindset? How did it help you?</li>
						<li>When is a time you would have benefited from thinking with a growth mindset? what could you do differently in a situation like that next time?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Part of cultivating a growth mindset is creating a classroom culture that supports learning. Work with your class to develop a list of classroom norms by responding to these questions:
					<ul>
						<li>What makes it easier for you to learn?</li>
						<li>What gets in the way of your learning?</li>
						<li>What classroom norms could we create to facilitate your learning?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					All levels of computing experience are welcome in this class. To help your teacher understand your background, share your responses to these questions:
					<ul>
						<li>What is your computing experience?</li>
						<li>What do you want out of this course?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
