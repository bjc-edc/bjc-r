		<h2>Draw Like a Computer</h2>
		<div class="learn">
			<p><strong>In this activity,</strong> you will take turns pretending to be a programmer (giving drawing instructions), and a computer (whose job it is to follow the instructions precisely, but try to deviate from what you think they want you to draw).</p>
		</div>
		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
				<div class="sidenoteBig">Imagine the computer only knows how to draw:
					<ul>
						<li>a straight line</li>
						<li>a polygon (triangle, square, pentagon, etc.)</li>
						<li>a circle</li>
						<li>an arc (a part of a circle)</li>
					</ul>
					You can tell it how big to make things (e.g., 2 inches long) and at what angle things should be positioned (e.g., at a 45&deg; angle).
				</div>
				<li>Create a simple line-drawing that you think you could tell a computer how to draw, and <em>don't let anyone see it</em>...</li>
				<li>Then write a list of instructions for re-creating your drawing, being as precise as possible.</li>
				<li>
					With a partner, take turns being the programmer and being the computer: 
					<ul>
						<li>The programmer should provide the instructions (and <em>only</em> the instructions&mdash;no extra help or hints about what the drawing should look like) to the computer.</li>
						<li>The computer should follow the instructions as precisely as possible, <em>deliberately trying to take things very literally.</em></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Then, share the original drawings and compare them to the computer's interpretation. What instructions could the computer have given more precisely?</li>
				<div class="endnote">
					<h4><strong>For example...</strong></h4>
					<p>Here's  what might happen with the following instructions:
						<ul>
							<li>Draw a square in the middle of the page.</li>
							<li>Draw a horizontal line through the middle of the square.</li>
							<li>Draw a vertical line through the middle of the square.</li>
							<li>Draw three overlapping droplets with their points all touching the top of the vertical line.</li>

TG: learning objectives there are that you need precision to be able to describe something to a computer
	
By one way to make marching orders more interesting is to ask the students to come up with the picture that is supposed to be copied themselves, using only simple straight lines up down left right or 45° diagonal, circles, and arcs. Basically simple geometric sketches, nothing squiggly or anything. Those could all be collected and then reshuffled around the room in the standard marching orders way. That again could be a way to bring in their creativity into the classroom rather than have us give them the picture to be translated.

BUT then do this wonderful flip where we explain that the picture that they drew could also be thought of as coming from a function, like 2*(3+7). We’d show how that expression can be seen another way, as smaller one-task machines cascading into each other. I sometimes called the lower part of the picture below “funnel functions” because they look like funnels and return only one thing at the bottom and they are functions.



It could be a way to tell the students that this is a different kind of course with a different way of thinking, even more important when we are teaching teachers.



For example, I have a nice drawing of a smile, made up of a half circle for the mouth of smaller radius, a full circle for the Head, a smaller circle for the left eye with a Fill-in circle for the pupil, And this interesting idea of having the right Eye always be a mirror of the left Eye. (More on that later)

We could pause and see if students can get their friends to draw the smiley face as one of the examples of marching orders. We wouldn’t show the whole class the picture, we were just have copies of it given to half the people to see if they could get the other person to draw the face.

Then we can have a discussion that says here’s this magical circle “function”, what if you could train your friend to draw a circle with 4 “controlling inputs”: Center, size, fill, and arc. maybe there could even be a conversation with the class where these inputs somehow organically evolve as the most general way to describe a circle.



Then there’s the discussion where we ask the class, if we had this magical circle drawing function, could we use it to draw the face? The answer is yes! there are exactly 6 calls to circle with different inputs to get the face. So then could we actually think about the circle function somehow being called with six different input sets and generating a face? 

But wait, could drawing a face ALSO be a function? What would its inputs be? Again here we simply specify as center, size. And they would be six calls to circle inside. So this is where a whiteboard really helps, we can draw a really big funnel face function generator that has 6 Different Circle functions inside of it with different parameters, and all of that generating a face at the bottom.

Then we can ask would it be fun to make the face more general and be able to pass IN what the left eye looks like? So maybe we can make the picture that has the left eye be another input!  (With the idea that the right eye should be a LR symmetric version of the left eye.)



Now there are really only TWO calls to circle inside, for the outside face and the smile. The left eye gets somehow stamped on the left and then mirrored and stamped on the right. So we could actually set up the left eye as two calls to circle that somehow get combined together. We could come up with Inputs like size and where the corner of the pupil would be. Inside that block would be calls to two circles (one filled and one unfilled) but we know how to do that and that’s not a big deal. The important thing is the output is an eyeball picture, which gets fed into the rightmost input of “how to draw face”, the left eye.



I guess what came out of this whole thing is The fun of dynamically working with students. like white boarding with engineers where the black boxes might be for some new API. Or thinking about how services might talk to each other. We’re thinking about a picture and how to come up with interesting functions that can help us draw the picture, the output of the functions is always another picture, and we’re feeding them into each other in a very natural way. In the classroom this comes through a conversation where you interact with the students and helping guide the design of some things like the inputs to these functions. At no point are you really focusing on the fact that there’s a pen that Has to be picked up and put down etc. etc. it’s just thinking in a really abstract beautiful way about pictures being first class data and being able to be passed around without having to worry about how to actually specify this to somebody, the discussion moves beyond that.

In one fell swoop, the discussion with the students, or in our case for discussion with the teachers, emphasizes the beauty and joy of abstraction, we are treating pictures as data, creating functions on the fly that don’t exist, but pass around this beautiful idea of picture data back-and-forth, with the idea that we can eventually work with a program, (or another person) to generate whatever picture we want, as long as we (the speaker and the drawer) understanding of what these functions are and when to call them.

So basically it’s sweeping under the rug the idea of turtle graphics versus global specifications graphics and just thinking of a face as something that can be returned from a function. A circle is something that can be returned from a function. And you can use the circle function six different times to make the face function! Or two times to make an eyeball! And the eyeball can be passed into the face!

There is one final crescendo that’s perhaps more of a “if there is time kind of a activity”, in which you make a “big face” in which the eyes and nose are small faces. We tell the audience, how would we ever do this? And the answer is really simple: just called face one time for the big part In black, One more time with smaller parameters for the nose In orange, and the input to face is the left eye which is another call to face. So it’s not really recursion but the bigger face is a geometrically self similar shape so it looks really cool. And you reinforce this beautiful idea of abstraction that you could go bigger and bigger and bigger with these simple functions, in which you stop worrying about circles when you’re thinking about bigfaces.



So overall I’m proposing (1) let the students generate the initial marching orders picture (2) let them play the basic marching orders game, with a very short discussion afterwards about the importance of specifying things clearly to computers  (3) the students switch roles (drawer becomes speaker, speaker becomes drawer) to do the very simple face (4) and then having the teacher lead a class discussion about another way to think about problems, a very brief connection between the arithmetic expression and these funnel function diagrams, then a general group discussion where they group design the funnel function diagrams to make the face out of circles that I described above. (5) we end with a very brief discussion of how to make a big face out of smaller faces for eyes and nose is just the same idea they’ve been playing with all along… it’s just four calls to the face function!
