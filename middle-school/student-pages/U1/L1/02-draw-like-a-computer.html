		<h2>Draw Like a Computer</h2>
		<div class="learn">
			<p><strong>In this activity,</strong> you will take turns pretending to be a <em>programmer</em> (whose job it is to <em>give</em> drawing instructions), and a <em>computer</em> (whose job it is to <em>follow</em> the instructions precisely, but try to deviate from what is probably intended to be drawn).</p>
		</div>
		<div class="comment">I stopped doing activities like this when it became clear that, though the kids had fun and made a joke out of the abysmal failures, all they were learning was the failure of communication. And this isn't even a faithful experience of what Snap will be like. This is like programming in some old compiled language, where you hand over a list of code and only then find out what the computer thinks it means. One of the innovations of (now ancient) Logo was that, running in an interpreter, each command gave immediate feedback and so the kids could adjust and <em>make</em> the computer do what they wanted. It was constant success. Snap should be easier, and their first experience should be success, not failure, even if the failure is a joke. (I'm also a bit worried about the message that the computer is supposed to "follow the instructions preciesly but try to deviate...." Sounds like a devious computer, not a cooperative one.) And this is not functional-first. Why not start with Lab 2 the very first day?! If you are concerned about technical details, use a microworld to avoid having to teach UI and having kids distracted with a zillion primitives. And see BJC https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/2-gossip.html for another model. I've watched 6th graders who had ZERO prior programming experience do the gossip lesson on their first day and (some of them) move immediately into conjugating Spanish verbs (to show off to their Spanish teacher!) the second day. It could be even better now that we have microworlds available to help deal with presenting the blocks to kids.--PG</div>

				<div class="sidenoteBig">Imagine the computer (here, a person) only knows how to draw:
					<ul>
						<li>a straight line</li>
						<li>a polygon (triangle, square, pentagon, etc.)</li>
						<li>a circle</li>
						<li>an arc (a part of a circle)</li>
					</ul>
			    You can tell the computer how big to make things (e.g., 2 inches long) and at what angle things should be positioned (e.g., at a 45&deg; angle). </div>
				<li><strong>Using no more than a handful</strong> of the basic drawing elements from the list to the right (line, polygon, circle, and arc), create a simple drawing that you want the computer  to draw, and <em>don't let anyone see it</em>...</li>
				<li>Then write a list of instructions for re-creating your drawing, being as precise as possible.</li>
				<li>
					With a partner, take turns being the programmer and being the computer: 
					<ul>
						<li>The programmer should provide the instructions (and <em>only</em> the instructions—no extra help or hints about what the drawing should look like) to the computer. Don't peek at what the drawing  looks like until the end!</li>
						<li>The computer should follow the instructions as precisely as possible, <em>deliberately trying to take things very literally.</em></li><div class="comment">Again, from the world of computing from <em>our</em> youth, not the present. Yes, Snap does take each command very literally—and, ultimately, we <em>want</em> computers to do what we ask for, not what they think we should have asked for—but many advances in programming are aimed at making it easier for humans to communicate what they want without being computers, themselves. And, again, the Snap world lets you know <em>immediately at each command</em> what it thinks you wanted; it isn't waiting for you to commit to a total failure. --PG</div>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Then, share the original drawings and compare them to the computer's interpretation.&nbsp;</li>
				<ul>
			         <li>If the drawings match, the programmer has "won".&nbsp;</li>
				     <li>If the drawings don't match at all, the computer has "won".&nbsp;</li>
				</ul>
				<li>What instructions could the programmer have given more precisely?</li>
				<div class="endnote">
					<h4><strong>For example...</strong></h4>
					<p>Here's  what might happen with the following instructions:
						<ul>
							<li>Draw a square.</li>
							<li>Draw a two lines, each connecting the midpoints of opposite sides.</li>
							<li>Draw three overlapping droplets with their points all touching the top of the vertical line.</li>
						</ul>

						</div>
					</div>
					<p>Note that the programmer wasn't specific when describing the square's size, orientation, place on the page, or bow, and look what resulted! In a sense, the computer "won" this game, since the image was different from the original.
