		<h2>Draw Like a Computer</h2>
		<div class="learn">
			<p><strong>In this activity,</strong> you will take turns pretending to be a programmer (giving drawing instructions), and a computer (whose job it is to follow the instructions precisely, but try to deviate from what you think they want you to draw).</p>
		</div>
		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
				<div class="sidenoteBig">Imagine the computer only knows how to draw:
					<ul>
						<li>a straight line</li>
						<li>a polygon (triangle, square, pentagon, etc.)</li>
						<li>a circle</li>
						<li>an arc (a part of a circle)</li>
					</ul>
					You can tell it how big to make things (e.g., 2 inches long) and at what angle things should be positioned (e.g., at a 45&deg; angle).
				</div>
				<li>Create a simple line-drawing that you think you could tell a computer how to draw, and <em>don't let anyone see it</em>...</li>
				<li>Then write a list of instructions for re-creating your drawing, being as precise as possible.</li>
				<li>
					With a partner, take turns being the programmer and being the computer: 
					<ul>
						<li>The programmer should provide the instructions (and <em>only</em> the instructions&mdash;no extra help or hints about what the drawing should look like) to the computer.</li>
						<li>The computer should follow the instructions as precisely as possible, <em>deliberately trying to take things very literally.</em></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Then, share the original drawings and compare them to the computer's interpretation. What instructions could the computer have given more precisely?</li>
				<div class="endnote">
					<h4><strong>For example...</strong></h4>
					<p>Here's  what might happen with the following instructions:
						<ul>
							<li>Draw a square in the middle of the page.</li>
							<li>Draw a horizontal line through the middle of the square.</li>
							<li>Draw a vertical line through the middle of the square.</li>
							<li>Draw three overlapping droplets with their points all touching the top of the vertical line.</li>
						</ul>
