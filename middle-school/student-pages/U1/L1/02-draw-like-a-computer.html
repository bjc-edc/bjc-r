		<h2>Draw Like a Computer</h2>
		<div class="learn">
			<p><strong>In this activity,</strong> you will take turns pretending to be a <em>programmer</em> (whose job it is to <em>give</em> drawing instructions), and a <em>computer</em> (whose job it is to <em>follow</em> the instructions precisely, but try to deviate from what is probably intended to be drawn).</p>
		</div>
		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
				<div class="sidenoteBig">Imagine the computer (here, a person) only knows how to draw:
					<ul>
						<li>a straight line</li>
						<li>a polygon (triangle, square, pentagon, etc.)</li>
						<li>a circle</li>
						<li>an arc (a part of a circle)</li>
					</ul>
			    You can tell the computer how big to make things (e.g., 2 inches long) and at what angle things should be positioned (e.g., at a 45&deg; angle). </div>
				<li><strong>Using no more than a handful</strong> of the basic drawing elements from the list to the right (line, polygon, circle, and arc), create a simple drawing that you want the computer  to draw, and <em>don't let anyone see it</em>...</li>
				<li>Then write a list of instructions for re-creating your drawing, being as precise as possible.</li>
				<li>
					With a partner, take turns being the programmer and being the computer: 
					<ul>
						<li>The programmer should provide the instructions (and <em>only</em> the instructionsâ€”no extra help or hints about what the drawing should look like) to the computer. Don't peek at what the drawing  looks like until the end!</li>
						<li>The computer should follow the instructions as precisely as possible, <em>deliberately trying to take things very literally.</em></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Then, share the original drawings and compare them to the computer's interpretation.&nbsp;</li>
				<ul>
			         <li>If the drawings match, the programmer has "won".&nbsp;</li>
				     <li>If the drawings don't match at all, the computer has "won".&nbsp;</li>
				</ul>
				<li>What instructions could the programmer have given more precisely?</li>
				<div class="endnote">
					<h4><strong>For example...</strong></h4>
					<p>Here's  what might happen with the following instructions:
						<ul>
							<li>Draw a square.</li>
							<li>Draw a two lines, each connecting the midpoints of opposite sides.</li>
							<li>Draw three overlapping droplets with their points all touching the top of the vertical line.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

							<img class="inline noshadow" style="width:100px;" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab01/draw-like-computer-02.png" alt="a line-drawing that doesn't look like a gift: a square with a horizontal line through the middle, a vertical line through the middle, and a set of three overlapping droplets of different sizes hanging down from the top center of the square" title="a line-drawing that doesn't look like a gift: a square with a horizontal line through the middle, a vertical line through the middle, and a set of three overlapping droplets of different sizes hanging down from the top center of the square" />
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>Note that the programmer wasn't specific when describing the square's size, orientation, place on the page, or bow, and look what resulted! In a sense, the computer "won" this game, since the image was different from the original.
