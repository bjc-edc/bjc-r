		<h2>Say Hello to Snap<em>!</em></h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll play greet the user in various langauges and with fancy text.</div>
		
		<h3>Loading a Snap project</h3>
		<p>For each lab, we'll provide you with starter projects that you can save to your account.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Open this <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/prog/say-hi-to-snap.xml" title="Say Hi To Snap">Say Hi To Snap</a> project.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		
		<h3>Saying Hi</h3>
		<p>
			When you open the project, you'll see this single block in the <em>Scripts</em> area (the central space of the Snap<em>!</em> window):<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/say-hello.png" alt="say hello to () in ('English')" title="say hello to () in ('English')" />
		</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>Type your name in the blank slot, and click the block to see what happens. Did you see a bubble pop-up?</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Every Snap<em>!</em> program is made up of blocks, and those blocks tell the computer what to do. The job of this block is to say hello to the name entered.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>Choose a different language from the dropdown that says "English" and click the block again. What changed about the bubble this time?</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>You just saw how changing the inputs to a block changed its output. Now let's introduce some terminology.</p>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Reporters</strong> and <strong>Inputs</strong>
			<div class="todo">Some of this is redundant with content on the next page, I think we should cut this down using the language on the next page. --MF, 8/13/21</div>
			<ul>
    			<li>
					There are multiple types of blocks in Snap. This <code>say hi</code> block is a <strong>reporter</strong>. That means that it does some sort of computation and then "reports" the result to the rest of the program. When you click the block, you see the reported result in that bubble, like this:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/say-hello-with-inputs-reporting.png" alt="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'ol√° Ana'" title="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'ol√° Ana'" /><br />
					There can be infinitely many reporter blocks in the universe, since there are so many things that we can compute. This particular block reports a personal greeting, by combining your name with a translation of the word "hello" in the specific language. The output of this block is text, but other blocks might output numbers, lists, tables, or even images.
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Many blocks accept <strong>inputs</strong> that customize what they compute. The "say hi to" block accepts two inputs, your name and a language. If it didn't know your name, then it would only be able to translate a greeting, not personalize it. üòü The more inputs a block accepts, the more its output can be customized. </p>
					<p>If you've ever been to a sandwich shop and answered questions like "what kind of cheese?", "what kind of sauce?", "extra toppings?", it's a lot like that. The more questions the shop asks you, the more you get to customize your sandwich!</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
			
		<h3>Fancy More Blocks?</h3>
		<p>There are lots of blocks in Snap, and you can even make your own blocks (which you'll do very soon). For this project, we're only showing a few blocks and have hidden the rest.</p>
		<p>You should see a "fancy" block in the left sidebar: <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/fancy.png" alt="fancy ()" title="fancy ()" /></p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>Drag the fancy block into the Scripts area, under the <code>say hello</code> block from earlier.</li>
				<li>Type your name into the fancy block and click the block to see the output. Does it look‚Ä¶ ∆ë·µÉùêçùì¨—É?</li>
				<li>
					Now drag that <code>fancy</code> block into the first input of the say hello block, replacing your name from before, and click the block to see the output. If all went as planned, you should see a personalized greeting to a fancified version of your name in the chosen language.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/say-hello-fancy-with-inputs-reporting.png" alt="say hello to (fancy('Ana') in ('Cantonese') reporting 'n√©ih h√≥u ùïíÔºÆùïí'" title="say hello to (fancy('Ana') in ('Cantonese') reporting 'n√©ih h√≥u ùïíÔºÆùïí'" />
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>That's the power of reporter blocks! You can take the output from one block and use it as the input of another block, making a chain of computation.</p>

		<h3>Saving Your Project</h3>
		<div class="todo">The rest of this page is also redundant with the next, and the two must be reconciled. --MF, 8/13/21</div>

		<p>We recommend saving projects to your Snap<em>!</em> account so that you can find them later. Even if you didn't make many changes to this project, you might want to access it later.</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="7">
				<li>To save, open the File menu and select "Save as‚Ä¶". Once you click "OK," a copy of our project will be saved in your account, and you can make whatever changes you'd like.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>Make sure to always save your projects after a big change or when you're done for the day!</p>
		
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned to run a block by clicking it, you changed the inputs to the <code>say hello</code> and <code>fancy</code> blocks and observed their outputs, and you dragged the <code>fancy</code> block into the <code>say hello</code> block so that the output of one block could be used as the input of the other.</div>
