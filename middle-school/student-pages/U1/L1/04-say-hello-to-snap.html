		<h2>Say Hello to Snap<em>!</em></h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll play greet the user in various languages and with fancy text.</div>

		<h3>Loading a Snap project</h3>
		<p>For each lab, we'll provide you with starter projects that you can save to your account.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Open this <a class="js-run-v7 snap-project" href="/bjc-r/middle-school/prog/U1/lab01/say-hi-to-snap.xml" title="Say Hi To Snap - Snap! project">Say Hi To Snap</a> project.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>


		<h3>Saying Hi</h3>
		<p>
			When you open the project, you'll see this single <em>block</em> in the "Scripts" area (the central space of the Snap<em>!</em> window):<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab01/say-hello.png" alt="say hello to () in ('English')" title="say hello to () in ('English')" />
		</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>Type a name in the blank slot, and click the block to see what happens. Did you see a bubble pop-up?</li>
				<li>Change the name, and click the block again.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Every Snap<em>!</em> program is made up of blocks like <code>say hello</code> that tell the computer what to do. This block says hello to someone in a specified language.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>Choose a different language from the dropdown menu that says "English," and click the block again. What changed about the bubble this time?</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>You just saw how changing the inputs to a block changed its output. Now let's introduce some terminology.</p>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Reporters</strong> and <strong>Inputs</strong>
			<ul>
    			<li>
					There are multiple types of blocks in Snap. This <code>say hello</code> block is a <strong>reporter</strong> block. That means that it does some sort of computation and then "reports" the result. When you click it, the computer runs its code, and you see the reported result in a bubble, like this:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-with-inputs-reporting.png" alt="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'ol√° Ana'" title="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'ol√° Ana'" /><br />
				</li>
				<li>Many blocks, like <code>say hello</code>, accept <strong>inputs</strong> that customize what they do, and those inputs show up as spaces you can edit. The <code>say hello</code> block accepts two inputs, a name and a language. You can change the inputs to change the output (in this case, the reported greeting).</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3>Blocks Within Blocks</h3>
		<p>There are lots of blocks in Snap<em>!</em>, and you can even make your own. For this first project, most of the blocks are hidden, but you should see a <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab01/fancy.png" alt="fancy ()" title="fancy ()" /> block in the palette on the left.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>Drag the <code>fancy</code> block somewhere below the <code>say hello</code> block in the Scripts area.</li>
				<li>Type a name into the <code>fancy</code> block, and click it to see the output. Does it look‚Ä¶ ∆ë·µÉùêçùì¨—É?</li>
				<li>
					Snap<em>!</em> is called Snap<em>!</em> because you can <em>snap</em> blocks together. Drag that <code>fancy</code> block into the first input slot of the <code>say hello</code> block, replacing the name from before, and click the block to see the output.</li>
					<div class="endnote">
						<strong>Tip:</strong> You can tell where the block you are dragging will drop when you let it go because the input slot where it will land will be marked with a white box. <a href="#hint-drop" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a picture of how to know where a block you are dragging will drop">Click for a picture.</a>
						<div id="hint-drop" class="collapse"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab01/drag-and-drop.jpg" alt="image of Snap! 'Scripts' area with the 'fancy('Huan')' block being dropped into 'say hello to ('Huan') in ('Cantonese')'. There is a white box around the 'Huan' in the 'say hello to ('Huan') in ('Cantonese')' block showing where 'fancy('Huan')' will land." title="image of Snap! 'Scripts' area with the 'fancy('Huan')' block being dropped into 'say hello to ('Huan') in ('Cantonese')'. There is a white box around the 'Huan' in the 'say hello to ('Huan') in ('Cantonese')' block showing where 'fancy('Huan')' will land." /></div>
					</div>

					<li>You should see a personalized greeting to a fancy version of the input name in the chosen language.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-fancy-with-inputs-reporting.png" alt="say hello to (fancy('Huan') in ('Cantonese') reporting 'n√©ih h√≥u ·ïº‡∏¢ùïíÔºÆ'" title="say hello to (fancy('Huan') in ('Cantonese') reporting 'n√©ih h√≥u ·ïº‡∏¢ùïíÔºÆ'" />
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>That's the power of reporter blocks! You can use the output of one block as the input to another block, making a chain of computation.</p>

		<h3>Saving Your Project</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="9">
				<li>Make sure you are logged in to Snap<em>!</em> by checking that your name appears in the Snap<em>!</em> Cloud menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" alt="cloud menu button" title="cloud menu button" />), and logging in if necessary.</li>
				<li><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work" /> Save this project to your Snap<em>!</em> account by choosing "Save" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (it looks like a piece of paper with a corner folded: <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Be sure to save your projects after an important change and, if you are using a shared computer, whenever you're done for the day.</p>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned to run a block by clicking it, you changed the inputs to the <code>say hello</code> and <code>fancy</code> blocks and observed their outputs, and you dragged the <code>fancy</code> block into the <code>say hello</code> block so that the output of one block could be used as the input of the other.</div>
