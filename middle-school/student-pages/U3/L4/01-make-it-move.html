		<h2>Make It Move</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll learn about servo motors, how to connect one to your micro:bit, and use MicroBlocks to control its movement.</div>

		<h3>Collect Materials</h3>
		<p>For each activity, we'll provide you with a list of materials to gather and some suggested materials.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ul>
				<li>micro:bit</li>
				<li>USB cable</li>
				<li>Crazy Circuits Bit Board</li>
                <li>Servo motor</li>
                <li>General craft supplies (see <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U3/L2/01-pet-inventor.html">L2: Interactive Pet</a>)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3>Get Started and Set Up</h3>
		<p>Motors are one way to add movement to your projects. There are many different types of motors, including one called a <i>servo motor.</i> </p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
			<p>A <strong>servo motor</strong> provides position control, so it can be told to move into an exact spot. Its position can be selected from 0 to 180 degrees.</p>
        </div>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Insert your micro:bit into the Bit Board, pins facing down.</li>
                <li>Connect a servo to the pins on the Bit Board, making note of which pins.</li>
                <li>Add the servo library in MicroBlocks by selecting Library, and then Servo.ubl.</li>
			</ol>			
		</div>

		<h3>Make a Servo Move</h3>
        <p>Control the servo motor by using the servo motor blocks. After adding the servo library, you'll have the following blocks available:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>set servo to degrees</code></li> <p>Moves the servo arm to a particular position in degrees. The range of -90 to 90 degrees is equivalent to 180 degrees. Be sure to address the right servo (check your Bit Board to see which port your servo is connected to, and use the following chart as reference for determining servo position in degrees.</p>

            <li><code>set servo to X speed</code></li>
        </ul>
