        <h2>Paper Story</h2>
        <div class="learn">In this activity, you'll make your own paper creation that uses programmed lights to tell a story.</div>

        <h3>Plan Your Project</h3>
        <p>Brainstorm what story to tell using paper and lights. Use a pencil and sketch what it will look like.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Think first on your own and then discuss with a partner:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What story do you want to tell? What materials do you need to create your story?</li>
                        <li>Where will the micro:bit go? Where will the copper tape and LEDs go?</li>
                        <li>What pattern will the LEDs display? Will they use an input?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li> 
                <li>
                    <p>Place your micro:bit on a piece of paper and draw in pencil where to place your copper tape and LEDs. Take a look at the tips below for how to add multiple LEDs and how to layer pieces of copper tape. In this drawing, the lines are copper tape placements and the dots are LED locations.</p>
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L5/paper-sketch.png" alt="pencil drawing of paper of the copper tape paths and LED placement" title="sketch of copper tape and LED placement" width="250" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add copper tape and LEDs. Check that your LEDs are placed in the correct orientation (positive leg on the pin side, negative leg on the GND side).</p>
                    <div class="endnote">
                        <strong>Tip:</strong> It's okay to add more than one LED to a piece of copper tape. Note that both LEDs touch the copper tape that's attached to GND. 
                    </div>
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L5/paper-layout.png" alt="design now with copper tape and LEDs" title="copper tape and LEDs" width="250" />
                </li>             
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>Create with Code and Paper</h3>
        <p>After planning, start building your project both in MicroBlocks and out of paper.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="4">
                <li>
                    <p>Write the code that will control the LEDs. In this example, the <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B buttons</strong> are used to control each individual LED, as well as together when both buttons are pressed.</p>
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L5/paper-code.png" alt="code to control the A and B buttons" title="control A and B buttons" width="600" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use paper and any other materials to communicate your story.</p>

                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>


        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiple LEDs, Same Pin</strong></li>
            <p>It's okay to have multiple LEDs attached to the same copper tape. This type of circuit design is called <strong>parallel circuit</strong>.</p>
            <div class="vocabFullWidth">
                <p>A <strong>parallel circuit</strong> has multiple branches and allows for easier addition of multiple LEDs. In parallel, the LEDs retain most of their brightness.</p>
    
                <p>A <strong>series circuit</strong> has all elements in a chain, one after another and makes a complete circle. In series, the more LEDs added, the dimmer they become. </p>
            </div>
            <p>In this example, three LEDs are all attached to the same pin. This design works well for LEDs that all use the same code. If you want to control LEDs individually, attach them to separate pins.</p>

            <li><strong>Multiple LEDs, Different Pins</strong></li>
            <p>In this example, three LEDs are connected to three different pins. This allows for each LED to be programmed individually.</p>

            <div class="endnote">
                <strong>Tip:</strong> It's okay to have pieces of copper tape cross over one another. The key is to place something in between the two pieces of copper tape, like paper or clear tape.
