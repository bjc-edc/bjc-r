		<h3>LEDs and Circuits</h3>
		<p>
			In this activity, we'll explore programmable light by using LEDs. 
		</p>  
		<div class="vocabFullWidth">
			<p>An <strong>LED</strong> contains a light emitter inside of a plastic bulb. This light emitter can be made from different materials, and when electricity runs through it, it shines different colors. However, electricity can only flow in one direction, and the name for electronic parts with this quality is called a diode. Thus, an LED stands for "light-emitting diode."</p>
        </div>
		<p>
			An LED only works when oriented in one direction (it's not reversible), so it's important to be familiar with its structure. LEDs have two legs with different lengths. The long leg is the positive side of the LED, and the short leg is the negative side.
		</p>
		<img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L5/led-diagram.png" alt="LED labeled with positive and negative leg" title="LED Diagram" width="350" />
		<p>
			First, we will illuminate an LED with only a battery (no code). The simplest way is to place the positive (+) side of your LED on the positive side of the battery. 
		</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>
					Grab an LED and a coin cell battery. Place the long leg on the positive (+) side of the battery, and the short leg on the negative side (-) of the battery ].
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			Next, we'll walk through how to make a circuit on a piece of paper.
		</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>Recreate this drawing on a quarter sheet of paper. The circles are created by tracing a coin cell battery twice in the corner of the piece of paper. The dashed line is where the paper folds. Take note of where the positive (+) and negative (-) signs are located.</li>
				<img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L5/circuit-sketch.png" alt="a paper with diagram to reproduce, including directional (+) and (-) signs" title="Circuit Diagram" width="400" />
				<li>Use copper tape to cover the drawn path, leaving a gap in the middle. Careful to use one continuous piece of tape, if possible, as the underside of the tape is less conductive and may lead to the light not turning on.</li>

			</ol>
		</div> 

		<div class="endnote">
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Use this folding technique to make corners with copper tape. 
		</div>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>Place the coin cell battery face up so that it's on top of the (-) circle.<li>Place your LED onto the copper strips in the correct (+)/(-) orientation, and your light should illuminate.</li>
			</ol>
