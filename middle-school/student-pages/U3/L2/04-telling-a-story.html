		<h2>Telling a Story</h2>
		<div class="todo">Add documentation standard? --MF, 3/16/22</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll bring your pet to life using cardboard, paper, and code.</div>

        <p>Now that you've made your interactive pet, document its interactions so that a classmate can know how to interact with it.</p>
        <div>
            <p>Describe your pet, how you interact with it (the inputs and outputs), and a story about your pet.</p>
            <p><i>Example: Meet Orange! Heâ€™s a very vocal cat. When the A button is pressed, he meows loudly. When the B button is pressed, he purrs softly.</i></p>

                It's helpful to share your designs with others for design feedback, to share ideas, and to test that your project works as intended. Share your pet with a partner by telling its story of how to interact with it. If something doesn't work as intended, make your desired changes to your design.
