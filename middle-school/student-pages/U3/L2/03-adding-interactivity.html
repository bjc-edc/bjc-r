		<h2>Adding Interactivity</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll bring your pet to life with code.</div>
		<div class="todo">Mary stopped reviewing here for now. --MF, 3/15/22</div>

		<p>To make your pet interactive, you will need to use at least two different <strong>inputs</strong> that cause at least two different <strong>outputs</strong>.</p>

        <div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Input and Output</strong>
			<p>In computing, the <strong>input</strong> is the action that tells the computer to do something. The <strong>output</strong> is the resulting action that occurs after the input command is received.</p>
            <p>The micro:bit has different types of inputs: light (bright or dark), button pressed, or certain movement. The output we're currently exploring is displaying a picture on the LED display.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Consider the following inputs and decide which one to use to enhance your pet’s personality or story.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>light level</code> (like from Lab 1)</li>
            <li><code>button A</code> or <code>button B</code></li>
            <li><code>tilt x</code> or <code>tilt y</code> or <code>tilt z</code></li>
        </ul>

				<div class="todo">Need to include link to MicroBlocks again. copy from L1. --MF, 3/16/22 
					<p>Open <a class="" href="https://microblocks.fun/run/microblocks.html" title="MicroBlocks" target="_blank">MicroBlocks</a> in a Chrome browser.</p>
					Also, are we having them create a new project? I think we should, and if so, we should tell them. Will they need to load the libraries again? --MF, 3/16/22</div>
				<li>
					Use a <code>when</code> block to start your script.<br />

				</li>
                <li>
					Select an input for your interactive pet. Note that you'll need to include an inequality with <code>light level</code> and <code>tilt x</code>. Experiment with different values to trigger the script (100 may not be the right value). For a reminder about inequalities, check out 1.6.2, 1.6.3, and 1.7.<br />

					Create an animation using the <code>LED display</code>, <code>wait</code>, and <code>repeat</code> blocks.<br />
