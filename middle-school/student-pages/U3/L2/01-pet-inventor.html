		<h3>Get Started</h3>
		<p>Imagine a pet that you would like to create. This can be a real, fictional, or entirely new creature. Your pet will respond to your touch using micro:bit’s sensors and inputs, and the LED display will add to your creature’s personality. Think about how it spends its day or activities it enjoys doing.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>
					Brainstorm what creature you would like invent. Use a pencil and sketch what it will look like<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L2/cat-brainstorm.png" alt="sketch of a cat with different mouth shapes for micro:bit" title="Pet Brainstorm" width="500" />
				</li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Think first on your own and then discuss with a partner: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>What will its body look like? What materials do you need?</li>
                    <li>Where will the micro:bit go? How will it be used to enhance the pet?</li>
                    <li>What will be shown on the LED display?</li>
                </ul>

				<li>	
					Your pet will also become interactive in (at least) one of these ways: press a button, tilt the micro:bit, or change in light level (see <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U3/L1/01-get-ready.html">L1: Meet micro:bit</a>). Start thinking about how to incorporate on of these <strong>inputs</strong> into your interactive pet.
				</li>
			</ol>			
		</div>
		<p>Once you have a pet in mind, start building it with the suggested supplies as well as other available materials. When ready, start making your interactive component. </p>
