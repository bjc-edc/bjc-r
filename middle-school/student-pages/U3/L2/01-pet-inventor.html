		<h2>Pet Inventor</h2>
		<div class="todo">I propose the activity name: "Designing Your Pet." Thoughts? --MF, 3/15/22</div>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll design an interactive, imaginary creature that uses the micro:bit LED display.</div>

		<h3>Collect Materials</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<img class="inline noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/gather-materials.png" alt="Gather Materials" title="Gather Materials" />
					<ul>
						<li>micro:bit</li>
						<li>USB cable</li>
						<li>battery pack (optional)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<div class="todo">Deanna, I moved the materials that aren't used until the next activity into the next activity. --MF, 3/15/22</div>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3>Plan Your Pet</h3>
		<p>Your pet can be real, fictional, or an entirely new creature of your own creation. It will detect its environment using micro:bitâ€™s sensors and inputs, and the LED display will let your pet respond. </p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>
					Brainstorm your creature. Think about how it spends its day or the activities it enjoys doing. Use a pencil and sketch what it will look like.<br />

				</li>
				<div class="todo">Hi Deanna, I restructured this a bit. LMK what you think. --MF, 3/15/22</div>
                <li>
					Write some notes about how your pet will look and behave:
					<ul>
						<li>What will its body look like? What materials do you need?</li>
						<li>Where will the micro:bit go? How will it be used to enhance the pet?</li>
						<li>What will be shown on the LED display?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>	
					Your pet should respond to at least one of these interactions:
					<ul>
						<li>Pressing a button</li>
						<li>Tilting the micro:bit</li>
						<li>Changing the light level (see <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U3/L1/01-get-ready.html">L1: Meet micro:bit</a>)</li>
					</ul>
					Write some notes about how your pet will be respond to your actions.
				</li>
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> 
					Share your ideas with a partner.
				</li>
			</ol>			
		</div>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>I think we should take out the following because this is stuff that happens on the next page. --MF, 3/15/22</p>
			<p>Once you have a pet in mind, start building it with the suggested supplies as well as other available materials. When ready, start making your interactive component. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you decided on a pet to create and thought about how to make it interactive using micro:bit.</div>
