		<title>Unit 3 Lab 1: Introduction to micro:bit</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h2>Introduction to micro:bit</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this lab, you'll write a Snap<em>!</em> program in MicroBlocks to interact with a micro:bit.</div>

		<h3>Collect Materials</h3>
		<p>For each lab, we'll provide you with a list of materials to gather and some suggested materials.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ul>
				<li>micro:bit</li>
				<li>USB cable</li>
				<li>Battery pack (optional)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3>Set Up MicroBlocks</h3>
		<p>For this unit, you'll use a program called MicroBlocks, a Snap<em>!</em> programming language designed to control tools like micro:bit.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>
					Open <a class="" href="https://microblocks.fun/run/microblocks.html" title="MicroBlocks">MicroBlocks</a> in either a Chrome, Firefox, Edge browser.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/MicroBlocks.png" alt="MicroBlocks logo" title="MicroBlocks logo" width="250" />
				</li>
				<li>
					Connect your micro:bit to your computer with a USB cable. Select your board from the browser dialog box, then click Connect. <br/>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/browser-connect-dialog.png" alt="dialog box to connect micro:bit" title="browser connect dialog" width="300" />
				</li>

				<li>	
					A green circle will automatically appear behind the USB icon, showing that the micro:bit is connected. If not, ask your teacher for help.<br/>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/connected.png" alt="green circle around a USB cable" title="connected" width="250" />
				</li>
			</ol>			
		</div>
		<p>Your micro:bit is now connected, but you'll need to add more blocks to program it. You'll do this by adding a couple of libraries to MicroBlocks.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>
					Click the + symbol next to Libraries.</br>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/add-library.png" alt="plus sign next to Libraries circled" title="add library" width="350">
				</li>
				<li>
					Select Basic Sensors.ubl and then click open. Do the same for LED Display.ubl.<br/>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/select-libraries.png" alt="plus sign next to Libraries circled" title="add library" width="350">
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3>Make a Smiley Face</h3>
		<p>
			One block that's unique to micro:bit is the <code>display</code> block. It's designed to look like the grid of LEDs on one side of the board. There are 25 LEDs that you can turn on and off individually.  
		</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="6">
				<li>Drag the <code>display</code> block into the Scripts area. Design your own face by clicking the LED rectangles to turn them on or off.</li>
				<li>
					Click on the block once and a smiley face will appear on your micro:bit.<br/>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/smiley-1.jpg" alt="smiley face on a micro:bit next to computer code" title="smiley face test" width="350">
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3>Animate Your Face</h3>
		<p>
			Bring your face to life by adding a second <code>display</code> with another expression.
			<div class="endnote">
				<strong>Tip:</strong> Animations are a rapid sequence of images displayed sequentially. To bring your face to life, you'll need to switch between <code>display</code> blocks quickly, but not too quickly. To achieve this, use a <code>wait</code> block after each <code>display</code>. Play with the amount of time until you find one that you like.
			</div>
		</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="8">
				<li>Make a second expression using another <code>display</code> block.</li>
				<li>
					Create a loop to cycle through both expressions.<br/>

					<img src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/smile-loop-code.png" alt="code to create smiley loop" title="smiley loop code" height="200">
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3>Make an Interactive Face</h3>
		<p>So far, your face changes on its own, but you can control when it changes between faces. One way to do this is to use the light sensor on the micro:bit. It can detect different levels of light, so you can change your micro:bit face whether its bright or dark (by covering the micro:bit with your hand).</p>
		<div class="endnote">
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Light levels vary greatly depending on the room that you're in, so you'll need to experiment with values for what's considered bright or dark. One way to do this is to use the <code>say</code> block. <a href="#hint-drop" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a picture of how to know where a block you are dragging will drop">Click for a picture.</a>
			<div id="hint-drop" class="collapse"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/light-level.png" alt="code for detecting the light level, using a say block and light level" title="light level" width="250"/></div>
		</div>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="10">
				<li>
					Use an <code>if</code> statement and <code>light level</code>to change the micro:bit's facial expression.<br/>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/smiley-2.gif" alt="animation of two expressions on micro:bit" title="smiley loop" height="200">
					<img src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/smiley-code-2.png" alt="code to create smiley loop" title="smiley loop code" height="200">
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3>Take It Further</h3>
		<p>Use these ideas as a starting point to make your own animated faces. What other expressions can you try? How many "frames," or <code>display</code> blocks, can you incorporate to make a more detailed animation?</p>

		<div class="learn">In this lab, you learned how to set up a coding environment for micro:bit, you used a <code>display</code> block to make create an image on a micro:bit using LEDs, and you created an animation using loops.</div>
