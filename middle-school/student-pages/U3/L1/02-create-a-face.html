        <h2>Face Creator</h2>
        <div class="learn">In this activity, you'll write a script to make an animated face. </div>

		<h3>Animate Your Face</h3>
		<p>
			In the activity, you made a face using the <code>display</code> block appear on your micro:bit. We'll start with this block and build from it.
		</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Make a your own face design on the <code>display</code> block by clicking on individual rectangles. When they are red, the light corresponding LED will illuminate on the micro:bit.</li>
				<li>
					Create a loop to cycle through both expressions.<br/>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/smile-loop.gif" alt="animation of two expressions on micro:bit" title="smiley loop" height="300">

				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="endnote">
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Animations are a rapid sequence of images displayed sequentially. To bring your face to life, you'll need to switch between <code>display</code> blocks quickly, but not too quickly. To achieve this, use a <code>wait</code> block after each <code>display</code>. Play with the amount of time until you find one that you like.
		</div>

		<h3>Make an Interactive Face</h3>
		<p>So far, your face changes on its own, but you can control when it changes between faces. One way to do this is to use the light sensor on the micro:bit. It can detect different levels of light, so you can change your micro:bit face whether its bright or dark (by covering the micro:bit with your hand).</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>
					Use an <code>if</code> statement and <code>light level</code> to change the micro:bit's facial expression.<br/>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/smiley-2.gif" alt="animation of two expressions on micro:bit" title="smiley loop" height="350">
					<img src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/smile-light.png" alt="code to create smiley loop" title="smiley loop code" height="350">
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="endnote">
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Light levels vary greatly depending on the room that you're in, so you'll need to experiment with values for what's considered bright or dark. One way to do this is to use the <code>say</code> block. <a href="#hint-drop" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a picture of how to know where a block you are dragging will drop">Click for a picture.</a>
			<div id="hint-drop" class="collapse"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/light-level.png" alt="code for detecting the light level, using a say block and light level" title="light level" width="250"/></div>
		</div>

		<div class="ifTime show"> Use these ideas as a starting point to make your own animated faces. What other expressions can you try? How many "frames," or <code>display</code> blocks, can you incorporate to make a more detailed animation?</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you used a <code>display</code> block to make create an image on a micro:bit using LEDs, and you created an animation using loops.</div>
