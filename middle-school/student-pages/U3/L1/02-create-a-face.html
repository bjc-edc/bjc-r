        <h2>Create a Face</h2>
        <div class="learn">In this activity, you'll design your own face to appear on your micro:bit in MicroBlocks. Then, you can experiment with making your face interactive using the light sensor.</div>

		<h3>Animate Your Face</h3>
		<p>
			Bring your face to life by adding a second <code>display</code> with another expression.
			<div class="endnote">
				<strong>Tip:</strong> Animations are a rapid sequence of images displayed sequentially. To bring your face to life, you'll need to switch between <code>display</code> blocks quickly, but not too quickly. To achieve this, use a <code>wait</code> block after each <code>display</code>. Play with the amount of time until you find one that you like.
			</div>
		</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Make a second expression using another <code>display</code> block.</li>
				<li>
					Create a loop to cycle through both expressions.<br/>

		</div>

		<h3>Make an Interactive Face</h3>
		<p>So far, your face changes on its own, but you can control when it changes between faces. One way to do this is to use the light sensor on the micro:bit. It can detect different levels of light, so you can change your micro:bit face whether its bright or dark (by covering the micro:bit with your hand).</p>
		<div class="endnote">
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Light levels vary greatly depending on the room that you're in, so you'll need to experiment with values for what's considered bright or dark. One way to do this is to use the <code>say</code> block. <a href="#hint-drop" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a picture of how to know where a block you are dragging will drop">Click for a picture.</a>
			<div id="hint-drop" class="collapse"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/light-level.png" alt="code for detecting the light level, using a say block and light level" title="light level" width="250"/></div>
		</div>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>
					Use an <code>if</code> statement and <code>light level</code>to change the micro:bit's facial expression.<br/>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L1/smiley-2.gif" alt="animation of two expressions on micro:bit" title="smiley loop" height="200">

				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3>Take It Further</h3>
		<p>Use these ideas as a starting point to make your own animated faces. What other expressions can you try? How many "frames," or <code>display</code> blocks, can you incorporate to make a more detailed animation?</p>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned how to set up a coding environment for micro:bit, you used a <code>display</code> block to make create an image on a micro:bit using LEDs, and you created an animation using loops.</div>
