        <h2>Face Creator</h2>
        <div class="learn">In this activity, you'll write a script to make an animated face. </div>
		<div class="todo">In the future, I wonder if this activity could be lightly rewritten to allow for students to animate between <em>any</em> two designs to provide a little additional agency/opportunity to customization. The face could remain as the example though because it's super cute. --MF, 1/28/22</div>


		<h3>Animate a Face</h3>
		<div class="todo">Deanna, do you have a plan for saving projects and creating accounts with MicroBlocks (e.g. Creating a Snap<em>!</em> Account on <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U1/L1/03-creating-snap-account.html?topic=middle-school%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" target="_blank">1.1.3</a> or Loading and Saving on <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U1/L1/04-say-hello-to-snap.html?topic=middle-school%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" target="_blank">1.1.4</a>)? That should added early in U3 (e.g., on 3.1.1). Then we can use the similar naming/saving/opening language as in other units. I also think we should include a link to MicroBlocks at the start of the page. --MF, 1/28/22</div>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If it isn't already, open <a class="" href="https://microblocks.fun/run/microblocks.html" title="MicroBlocks" target="_blank">MicroBlocks</a>, and connect your micro:bit.</li>

				<div class="endnote">
					<strong>Tip:</strong> Animations are a rapid sequence of images displayed in a row. To bring your face to life, you'll need to switch between <code>display</code> blocks quickly, but not too quickly. To achieve this, use a <code>wait</code> block after each <code>display</code>. Adjust with the amount of time the program waits to what you like.
				</div>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3>Make an Interactive Face</h3>
		<p>So far, the face changes on its own, but you can control when it changes&mdash;for example, by using the micro:bit's light sensor. The light sensor can detect different levels of light, and you can program the micro:bit to change the face depending on how much light the sensor detects.</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>
					Use an <code>if</code> block together with a <code>light level</code> block to change the micro:bit's facial expression based on the light it detects.<br/>
					<div class="comment">Students will need some instructions about using this IF block block because it's not like the IF ELSE that they are used to. Same remark about the WHEN STARTED as above. Also, I recall that we discussed agreeing to use IF ELSE and not IF ELSEIF here, which is good because we haven't taught IF ELSEIF yet. --MF, 1/28/22</div>

				<div class="endnote">
					<strong>Tip:</strong> Light levels vary greatly depending on the room that you're in, so you'll need to experiment with values for your program considers bright or dark, and you may need to change it later for a different room. One way to do this is to use the <code>say</code> block. <a href="#hint-drop" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a picture of how to know where a block you are dragging will drop">Click for a picture.</a>

		<div class="ifTime show">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>Make a more complicated animation. What other blocks can you try?</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you used <code>display</code> blocks together with <code>forever</code>, <code>wait</code>, and <code>light level</code> to create animations controlled by pauses and by light.</div>
