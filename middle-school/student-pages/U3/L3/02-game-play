		<h2>Game Play</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll start to make an interactive, imaginary creature that uses the micro:bit LED display.</div>

		<h3>Collect Materials</h3>
		<p>For each activity, we'll provide you with a list of materials to gather and some suggested materials.</p>

		<h3>Get Started</h3>
		<p>Imagine a pet that you would like to create. This can be a real, fictional, or entirely new creature. Your pet will respond to your touch using micro:bit’s sensors and inputs, and the LED display will add to your creature’s personality. Think about how it spends its day or activities it enjoys doing.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>
					Brainstorm what creature you would like invent. Use a pencil and sketch what it will look like<br />

				</li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Think first on your own and then discuss with a partner: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>What will its body look like? What materials do you need?</li>
                    <li>Where will the micro:bit go? How will it be used to enhance the pet?</li>
                    <li>What will be shown on the LED display?</li>
                </ul>

				<li>	
					Your pet will also become interactive in (at least) one of these ways: press a button, tilt the micro:bit, or change in light level (see Lab 3 Activity 2). Start thinking about how to incorporate on of these <strong>inputs</strong> into your interactive pet.
				</li>
			</ol>			
		</div>
		<p>Once you have a pet in mind, start building it with the suggested supplies as well as other available materials. When ready, start making your interactive component. </p>

					Click the + symbol next to Libraries.</br>

			One block that's unique to micro:bit is the <code>display</code> block. It's designed to look like the grid of LEDs on one side of the board. There are 25 LEDs that you can turn on and off individually.  
		</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Drag the <code>display</code> block into the Scripts area. Design your own face by clicking the LED rectangles to turn them on or off.</li>
				<li>
					Click on the block once and a smiley face will appear on your micro:bit.<br/>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned how to set up a coding environment for micro:bit and made a face display on the micro:bit LED display.</div>
