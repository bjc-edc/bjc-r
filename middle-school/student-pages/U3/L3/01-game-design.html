		<h2>Game Design</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll start making a game (or reimagine an existing one) that uses micro:bit using light level, buttons, or tilt to be played either individually or with others.</div>

		<h3>Collect Materials</h3>
		<p>For each activity, we'll provide you with a list of materials to gather and some suggested materials.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ul>
				<li>micro:bit</li>
				<li>USB cable</li>
				<li>General craft supplies (see <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U3/L2/01-pet-inventor.html">L2: Interactive Pet</a>)</li>
				<li>Homemade switch materials (optional)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Aluminum foil</li>
						<li>Alligator clip wires</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3>Get Started</h3>
		<p>Think of a game you've played many times, and imagine how adding code could enhance the experience. You'll make a game that uses the micro:bit only or uses the micro:bit as a part to the game alongside other general craft materials. </p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Brainstorm the game that you would like to bring to life. Use micro:bit inputs and outputs that you know to incorporate into game play, such as:</p>
					<strong>Inputs:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Light level</li>
						<li>A or B button</li>
						<li>Tilt x, y, or z</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Outputs:</strong> LED display</p>
				</li>
				
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Think first on your own and then discuss with a partner: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are the rules to the game?</li>
                    <li>How will the game start? How will players know when it ends?</li>
                    <li>Is it single player, or can it be played collaboratively?</li>
                </ul>
			</ol>			
		</div>
		<p>
			Before building, decide whether you would like your game to be played with the micro:bit only or if you want to include additional materials.
		</p>
		<h3>Example 1: micro:bit only</h3>
		<strong>Fast Click</strong>
		<p>
			In this game, players click the A and B buttons as quickly as they can. After the micro:bit displays ”GO”, Player A and B will try to click their respective buttons as fast as possible. The player able to click their button 10 times the fastest wins. The LEDs will then display the letter of which player (A or B) won the round.
