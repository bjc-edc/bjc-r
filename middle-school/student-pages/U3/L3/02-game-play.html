		<h2>Game Play</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll build your game and play it with classmates.</div>

		<p>
			In the previous activity, you were introduced to a game that uses the micro:bit only. The following is an example game that uses additional materials. We'll introduce read analog pin, a new input type, and use the <code>read analog pin</code> blocks to determine whether an action has occurred or not using a switch.
		</p>

		<div class="vocabFullWidth">
			<p>An <strong>analog input pin</strong> can read a voltage level that ranges of voltages provided to your micro:bit. </p>

			<p>A <strong>switch</strong> is an electronic device that disconnects or connects and electrical path, resulting in a circuit turning off or on. </p>
        </div>

		<p>Make a switch using your micro:bit by connecting alligator clip wires to Pin 0 and GND. Start by connecting these two alligator clips together and you've got a switch! Use another conductive material like aluminum foil to add more complex shapes to your game design.</p>

		<h3>Example 2: micro:bit + materials</h3>
		<strong>Tube Ball</strong>
		<p>A toilet paper tube transforms into a basket for catching a ball. Alligator clips to make a homemade switch, so when the ball is inside the tube, it completes the circuit. I really like this technique and hope we can use it more! I'm also using a counter to keep track of every time the ball goes in the hole. To reset the game, press the A button.</p>

		<div class="ifTime show">
			After playing your game with classmates, ask them for feedback on your game. Was it easy to play? Did the rules make sense? Consider their feedback and make appropriate changes to you game design.
		</div>

		<div class="ifTime show">
			If you have completed your game early, make a game of the opposite type. For example, if you made a micro:bit only game, make a game that uses additional materials or visa versa.

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you built your own game and tested it with classmates.</div>
