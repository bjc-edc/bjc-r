		<h2>Interactive Communication</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you and your partner will make a project that uses two micro:bits in communication with one another.</div>

        <p>Now you can use radio to communicate between two micro:bits and make an interactive project. Here are two different pathways to consider when making a collaborative project with your partner.</p>

        <h3>Remote Controller</h3>
		<p>Use one micro:bit as a remote control that takes different <strong>inputs</strong> like button, tilt, light, or pin. Then use a second micro:bit to control <strong>outputs</strong> like LED display, servo motors, LEDs, and music. This drawing machine uses one micro:bit to control two servo motors attached to a second micro:bit which make marks on a piece of paper. Refer back to <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U3/L4/01-make-it-move.html">Lab 4: Marvelous Movements</a> for a refresh on how to control servo motors.</p>

        <h3>Two Player Game</h3>
		<p>Consider using each micro:bit as a controller for playing a two-person game. In this example, the game Rock Paper Scissors is made into a physical game using copper tape like in Lab 6: Paper Stories. Each of the three pins on the micro:bit are used as the three options in the game. The copper tape is used to make small switches to indicate the player's selection. Radio communication between micro:bits determines if the player wins, loses, or draws.</p>

        <div>
			<h3>Create a Custom Message</h3>
			<p>Now that you've successfully sent a message, craft your own with a partner.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />First think on your own and then discuss with a partner:
					<ul>
						<li>What message do you want to send?</li>
						<li>What input will send your message? Buttons pressed, tilt, light levels, or something else?</li>
						<li>What will be your output when a message is received? Text, servo motor moves, light illuminates, or something else?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Create your messages and send them back and forth.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="ifTime show">
			<p>Select a new group radio channel with more than two students and think of messages to send that would work for a larger group. Consider using other physical outputs like you used in Lab 4 or Lab 5.</p>
