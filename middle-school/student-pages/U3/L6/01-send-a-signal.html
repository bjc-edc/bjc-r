		<h2>Send a Signal</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you and a partner will connect your micro:bits and send messages back and forth.</div>

		<p>A micro:bit can use <strong>radio waves</strong> to wirelessly communicate to another micro:bit. One micro:bit can send transmit or a message, the other will receive and can then be programmed to send a message back.</p>

		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Radio Communication</strong>
			<p><strong>Radio</strong> is a way of transmitting and receiving information over a distance.</p>
        </div>

		Many micro:bits in the same room can cause interference and confusion when sending and receiving messages. To avoid this, pick a group that you and your partner will join that's unique from other groups. Start by sending a message back and forth with a partner, but know that you can add more than two micro:bits to a group for communication.
