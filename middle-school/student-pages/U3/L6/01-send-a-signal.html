		<h2>Send a Signal</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you and a partner will connect your micro:bits and send messages back and forth.</div>

		<p>A micro:bit can use <strong>radio waves</strong> to wirelessly communicate to another micro:bit. One micro:bit can send transmit or a message, the other will receive and can then be programmed to send a message back.</p>

		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Radio Communication</strong>
			<p><strong>Radio</strong> is a way of transmitting and receiving information over a distance.</p>
        </div>

		<p>Many micro:bits in the same room can cause interference and confusion when sending and receiving messages. To avoid this, pick a group that you and your partner will join that's unique from other groups. Start by sending a message back and forth with a partner, but know that you can add more than two micro:bits to a group for communication.</p>

		<h3>Text Messaging</h3>

		<p>Together with a partner, follow along with this example and then make your own.</p>
		
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Add the radio communication library by choosing <strong>Library</strong>, then <strong>Radio</strong> and <strong>Scroll Text</strong>.</li>
				<li>Both partners will create messages to send. It's important that these messages are different from one another to start, but this can be changed later on.</li>
				<li><strong>Both Partners</strong>: Add your group number to the <code>when started</code> block. The smiley face is a visual check for you to see that you are ready to receive radio messages. </li>
				<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L6/radio-when-started.png" alt="when started, set the radio group number" title="When Started with Radio" width="350"/>
				<li><strong>Each Partner</strong>: Pick a unique word or phrases to send to your partner. You can use the examples below as a test. In this case, one partner has the message of <strong>beep</strong> on their micro:bit and the other has the message <strong>boop</strong>.</li>
				<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L6/beep.png" alt="unique message 1: beep" title="Beep" width="300"/>
				<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L6/boop.png" alt="unique message 1]2: boop" title="Beep" width="300"/>
				<li><strong>Both Partners</strong>: Add this final script that checks for whether your micro:bit has received a message. To create it, start with the <code>when</code> block and ,<code>radio last received?</code> by dragging it on top of the green toggle.</li>
				<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L6/message-received.png" alt="when message received" title="Message Received" width="350"/>
				<li>Start the project by pressing the green play button in the top right hand corner. The new <code>when radio last received?</code> block should illuminate.</li>
				<img class="inline noshadow" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U3/L6/highlight.png" alt="highlight message after starting project" title="Message Received Highlighted" width="350"/>
				<li>Test out your code by pressing the <strong>A button</strong> on each micro:bit and see your message scroll by.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Create a Custom Message</h3>
			<p>Now that you've successfully sent a message, craft your own with a partner.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="8">
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />First think on your own and then discuss with a partner:
					<ul>
						<li>What message do you want to send?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
