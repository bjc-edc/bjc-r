					Create an eCard that meets all of the following specifications:
					<ol>
						<li>Has a message for the viewer (such as "Happy New Year," "Happy Birthday," "Get Well Soon," etc.)</li>
						<li>Has a theme (such as holiday, sports, TV show, a photo, original art, etc.)</li>
						<li>Has stage and sprite costumes</li>
						<li>Works properly (is not buggy)</li>
						<li>
							Includes a custom block. This can be either:
							<ul>
								<li>A <code>start over</code> block that resets the eCard to the beginning (resets pen, stage, and sprites) OR</li>
								<li>Another custom block containing at least 3 blocks (this could move a sprite, change the background, etc.)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Uses a loop (such as <code>repeat until</code> or <code>for</code>)</li>
						<li>Lets the user interact (e.g., by clicking a sprite, pressing a key, or moving the mouse)</li>
						<li>
							Includes one additional feature. For example, you can choose
							<ul>
								<li>Sounds or music (using the play block and/or the "Sounds" tab)</li>
								<li>The <code>random</code> block</li>
							</ul>
							<div class="endnote"><strong>Note: Sound files</strong> can be imported into Snap! projects, but which media types work depends on the local computer's browser and security settings. Regarding file size, there is no fixed limit, but large files and limited bandwidth situations can slow or timeout file transfers. Classrooms with limited bandwidth connections may opt to avoid sound importing altogether.
