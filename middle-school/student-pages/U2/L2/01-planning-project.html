		<h2>Planning Your Project</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will think about the kind of interactive project you want to create.</div>
		
		<img class="imageRight" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/leader-follower-animation.gif" alt="animation of a cartoon tiger chasing a cartoon bat that is following the mouse pointer" title="animation of a cartoon tiger chasing a cartoon bat that is following the mouse pointer"/>
		<p>You'll create characters or objects that move around (<em>sprites</em>) on top of a background image (the Snap<em>!</em> <em>stage</em>), and you'll control how they look by changing their <em>costumes</em>.</p>
		
		<div class="vocabFullWidth">
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong>stage</strong> is the big white rectangle in the upper right corner of your Snap<em>!</em> window. It's what users of your project see, and it's where your characters and objects (your <em>sprites</em>) live.</li> 
				<li>A <strong>sprite</strong> is like an actor on the stage who can do many different things, such as walk, talk, and whatever else you program it to do!</li>
				<li>A <strong>costume</strong> is a picture that can be "worn" by a sprite.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<h3>New Snap<em>!</em> Skills</h3>
		<p>
			You're going to create an interactive project (such as a poster, a card, or a cartoon) using each of the following new skills you will build:
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Costumes:</strong> You can use the ones built-in to Snap<em>!</em>, import pictures from the Internet, or draw your own.</li>
				<li><strong>Animation:</strong> You'll make your sprites move around the stage, say things, and change costumes.</li>
				<li><strong>Importing Code:</strong> You'll incorporate blocks from prior projects.</li>
				<li><strong>Sounds:</strong> You'll add or create audio recordings.</li>
				<li><strong>Events:</strong> You'll make your code respond to user clicks (such as on a sprite) by playing a sound, moving, or writing something for the user to read.</li>
				<li><strong>Hot Spots:</strong> You'll create <em>special areas</em> on the stage where clicking produces a special effect.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<div class="todo">
			<p>The <strong>Stage</strong> is what users of your project see. One or more <em>sprites</em> (characters) live on and can talk and move around on the stage. Sprites begin with an arrowhead costume (as shown in the picture of the Snap<em>!</em> interface), but you can change a sprite's costume (the picture that it wears) by choosing "Costumes..." the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</p>
		</div>
		
	
		<h3>Making your Plan</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<div class="todo">Maybe make a worksheet for this. --MF, 3/29/22</div>
			<ol>
				<li>Decide on the <em>purpose</em> of your interactive project. Will it serve as a poster, a greeting card, a cartoon, or something else? Who is it for? Is it for fun or for learning?</li>
				<div class="todo">
				<p>Todo: add an animation of each type (poster, a greeting card, a cartoon). --MF, 3/29/22</p>
				<div class="endnote">
					<p><a href="#hint-project-examples" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for some examples of interactive projects.">Click for some examples.</a></p>
					<div id="hint-project-examples" class="collapse">
						<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/" alt="" title="" />
						<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/" alt="" title="" />
						<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/" alt="" title="" />
					</div>
				</div>
				</div>
				<li>Your project should use each of the six new skills you will learn in this lab (costumes, animation, importing code, sounds, events, and hot spots). Review what these are by looking back at the "New Snap<em>!</em> Skills" section above, and decide how your project will demonstrate each new skill you learn.</li>
				<div class="ennote">It's normal to change your plans as you start creating, but it's helpful to have a plan before you start!</div>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, planned your interactive project including how you will use each of the new skills you will learn in this lab.</div>
