		<h2>Planning Your Project</h2>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you plan to develop an interactive Snap<em>!</em> project.</div>
		
		<p>You'll create characters or objects that move around (<em>sprites</em>) on top of a background image (the Snap<em>!</em> <em>stage</em>). You'll control how the sprites look by changing their <em>costumes</em>, and you'll control how the stage looks by changing its <em>background</em>. </p>
		
		<div class="vocabFullWidth">
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong>stage</strong> is the rectangle in the upper right of the Snap<em>!</em> window. It's what users of your project see, and it's where your sprites live.</li> 
				<li>A <strong>sprite</strong> is like an actor on the stage who can do many different things, such as walk, talk, and whatever else you program it to do!</li>
				<li>A <strong>costume</strong> is a picture that can be "worn" by a sprite.</li>
				<li>A <strong>background</strong> is a picture that can be "worn" by the stage.</li>

It has a background called Brick Wall 1. Here are two sprites: The first one has no costume (all sprites start out looking like an arrowhead). The second one has a costume called girl3 basketball.'" title="image of the Snap! stage with two sprites and the text: 'This is the Snap! stage. It has a background called Brick Wall 1.

			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="endnote">You first learned about sprites, costumes, and the Snap<em>!</em> stage in <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U1/L4/03-investigating-and-storing-images.html?topic=middle-school%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 4 Activity 3: Investigating and Storing Images">Unit 1 Lab 4 Activity 3: Investigating and Storing Images</a>.</div>

		
		<h3>New Snap<em>!</em> Skills</h3>

		<p>
			You're going to create an interactive project (such as a poster, a card, or a cartoon) using each of the following new skills you will build in this lab:
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Costumes and Backgrounds:</strong> You can use the ones built-in to Snap<em>!</em>, import pictures from the Internet, or draw your own.</li>
				<li><strong>Animation:</strong> You'll make your sprites move around the stage, say things, and change costumes.</li>
				<li><strong>Importing Code:</strong> You'll incorporate blocks from prior projects.</li>
				<li><strong>Sounds:</strong> You'll add or create audio recordings.</li>
				<li><strong>Events:</strong> You'll make your code perform certain actions (such as playing a sound or moving) when certain things happen (such as when the user clicks a sprite or when something else has finished happening).</li>
				<li><strong>Hot Spots:</strong> You'll create special areas on the stage where the user can click to produce an specific action.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
	
		<h3>Making Your Plan</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Decide on the <em>purpose</em> of your interactive project. Will it serve as a poster, a greeting card, a cartoon, or something else? Who is it for? Is it for fun or for learning? Is there a theme (holiday, sports, TV show, etc.)?</li>
				<div class="todo">
				<p>Todo: add an animation of each type (poster, a greeting card, a cartoon). --MF, 3/29/22</p>
				<div class="endnote">
					<p><a href="#hint-project-examples" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for some examples of interactive projects.">Click for some examples.</a></p>
					<div id="hint-project-examples" class="collapse">
						<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/" alt="" title="" />
						<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/" alt="" title="" />
						<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/" alt="" title="" />
					</div>
				</div>
				</div>
				<li>Your project should use each of the six new skills you will learn in this lab (costumes, animation, importing code, sounds, events, and hot spots). Review what these are by looking back at the "New Snap<em>!</em> Skills" section above, and decide how your project will demonstrate each new skill you learn.</li>
				<div class="endnote">It's normal to change your plans as you start creating, but it's helpful to have a plan before you start!</div>
				<li><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Share the purpose and plan for your interactive project with other people and ask for their feedback. What could make the project more fun, more useful, or easier to use?</li>
				<div class="todo">I'm trying to get at "2-AP-15: Seek and incorporate feedback from team members and users to refine a solution that meets user needs." Is this the working? If not, is it salvageable? --MF, 4/4/22</div>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, planned your interactive project including how you will use each of the new skills you will learn in this lab.</div>
