		<h2>Programming Styles</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll learn about the difference between programming by nesting blocks inside each other and programming by stacking blocks top to bottom.</div>
                <div class="comment">Okay, I think I actually suggested "nesting blocks" as the way to phrase it, but when this follows from the repeat-blocks lesson, that immediately made me think of nesting blocks inside the repeat blocks. My current vote for an accurate contrast is "nesting reporter blocks inside each other and programming by stacking command blocks top to bottom". I can't think of another verb to describe the contrast. -PF 2/10/22</div>

		<h3>Commands Versus Reporters</h3>
		<p>Before this unit, you've been nesting blocks inside each other so that the output reported by one block becomes the input to another. This style of programming is known as <em>functional programming</em>, and in Snap<em>!</em>, it primarily uses <em>reporter</em> blocks. A reporter computes a value and reports it (to you or to other blocks).<br />
                <div class="comment">Is "primarily" needed? I think technically true FP is entirely reporter blocks, no? -PF 2/10/22</div>

		</p>
		<p>In this unit, you've been stacking one atop the other blocks that change things. This style of programming is called <em>imperative programming</em>. In Snap<em>!</em>, imperative programming uses <em>command</em> blocks. A command tells the computer to do something, (play a sound, draw, move, change something, etc.). Commands have effects.</p>
                <div class="comment">I'm having trouble parsing "stacking one atop the other blocks that change things", I suspect there's a missing word? -PF 2/10/22</div>

				A <strong>reporter</strong> block does a calculation and reports the result. Reporters have an oval shape. <br />

				A <strong>predicate</strong> is a special kind of reporter that asks a true/false question and reports either true or false. Predicates have a hexagon shape.<br />

				A <strong>command</strong> block tells the computer to do something <em>without reporting a value</em>. Commands have a puzzle shape and can be snapped together one after another. <br />

		<h3>Creating a Command Block</h3>
		<p>You've created a reporter block before. You can create a command block in almost exactly the same way.</p>
