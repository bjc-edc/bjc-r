		<h2>Programming Styles</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll learn about the difference between programming by nesting reporter blocks inside each other and programming by stacking command blocks top to bottom.</div>

		<h3>Commands Versus Reporters</h3>
		<p>Before this unit, you nested blocks inside each other so that the output reported by one block became the input to another. That style of programming is known as <em>functional programming</em>, and in Snap<em>!</em>, it uses <em>reporter</em> blocks. A reporter computes a value and reports it (to you or to other blocks).<br />

		</p>
		<p>
			In this unit, you've been stacking blocks that carry out <em>actions,</em> such as playing a note. This style of programming is called <em>imperative programming</em>. In Snap<em>!</em>, imperative programming uses <em>command</em> blocks. A command tells the computer to do something, (play a sound, draw, move, change something, etc.). Commands have <em>effects.</em><br />

				A <strong>reporter</strong> block does a calculation and reports the result. Reporters have an oval shape. <br />

			<p>
				A <strong>predicate</strong> is a special kind of reporter that asks a true/false question and reports either true or false. Predicates have a hexagon shape.<br />

			</p>
			<div class="sidenote">You'll use commands much more in Unit 2.</div>
			<p>
				A <strong>command</strong> block tells the computer to do something <em>without reporting a value</em>. Commands have a puzzle shape and can be snapped together one after another. <br />

			<div class="endnote" style="clear: right;">Unlike reporters, a command block doesn't report anything, so you can't use its result as the input to another block&mdash;its result is an action, not a value!</div>

		<h3>Creating a Command Block</h3>
		<p>You've created a reporter block before. You can create a command block in almost exactly the same way.</p>

						  I'm confused by this red box comment.  Each attribute of a block has a <em>meaning</em> and a visual <em>representation.</em>  So:<br />
 color : palette :: shape : report behavior<br />
						  You seem happy to use the representation as the name for Shape, so why not be consistent and use the representation for Color too?  Or else change both of them (after inventing a good name for the meaning of the shape; mentally I call it "range" as in "domain and," but that's a stretch. -bh 2/15/22<br /><br />
P.S.  Apparently all this time Jens (following Scratch usage) uses "Palette" to mean that whole left column of the screen, all colors, and uses "Category" to mean what I've been calling the palette.  I don't know why he didn't tell me that right at the beginning!  My feeling is that changing our vocabulary is too horrible to contemplate.  Oh well.
</div>
						<li>Type the title (name) for your block: <code>mystery song</code>.</li>
						<li>Select the shape for your block: Command.</li>

		<p>When you create a reporter, the block editor opens with <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/report.png" alt="report" title="report" /> attached to the hat block, and whatever input you give to <code>report</code> will be the value reported by the new reporter. When you create a command, the block editor opens with only the hat block, and the blocks attached below it will run (in order) when the new command is run.</p>
