		<h2>Visualizing Loops</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will experiment with <em>loops</em> and see how they control the order in which the commands are run.</div>

		<h3>Using Visible Stepping</h3>
		<p>Snap<em>!</em> has a tool called <strong>Visible Stepping</strong> that allows you to watch Snap<em>!</em> process the blocks of your code in order. </p>
		<div class="todo">Add a little animated gif here.</div>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Open this <a class="js-run-v7 snap-project" href="/bjc-r/middle-school/prog/U2/lab01/sample-song-player.xml" title="Sample Song Player - Snap! project" target="_blank">Sample Song Player</a>, click the Visible Stepping button (<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/visible-stepping.png" alt="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" title="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" />), click the script to play the song, and watch how the Visible Stepping shows how the program moves through the nested repeat blocks.</li>
				<li>Click the Visible Stepping button (<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/visible-stepping.png" alt="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" title="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" />), and play your song to see Snap<em>!</em> run each block one at a time.</li>
				<div class="endnote">Visible Stepping can be useful when reading code because you can see what block is running.</div>
				<div class="vocab">
					<p>Repeating the same set of commands (such as with <code>repeat</code> or <code>forever</code>) is called <strong>iteration</strong>.</p>
				</div>
				<li>If you haven't already, try using the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="repeat () {}" title="repeat () {}" /> block to repeat a note or a sequence of notes in a song. Play your song with Visible Stepping turned on.</li>
				<li>
					You can even even <em>nest</em> one <code>repeat</code> inside another. Try it.
					<div class="todo">Add a clickable example image that opens in Snap<em>!</em> here.</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					Try using a <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever-full-size.png" alt="forever" title="forever" /> block to repeat a command (or group of commands) forever, and play your song with Visible Stepping on.
                    <div class="narrower" style="clear: right;">The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you stop it. You can <strong>click the red stop sign</strong>, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="red stop button" title="red stop button"/>, to stop your code from running.</div>
				</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" /></li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<div class="learn">In this activty, you used command blocks to tell the computer which notes to play, sequencing to order the command blocks, and <em>iteration</em> to repeat the commands.</div>
