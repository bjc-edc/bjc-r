		<h2>Visualizing Loops</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will experiment with <em>loops</em> and see how they control the order in which the commands are run.</div>

		<h3>Using Visible Stepping</h3>
		<p>Snap<em>!</em> has a tool called <strong>Visible Stepping</strong> that allows you to watch Snap<em>!</em> process the blocks of your code in order. </p>

					Discuss what happens when the script is run. How does Snap! implement the commands? Why does the song sound the way it does?

				<li>
					Now, open your "Song Player" project from the previous activity page, click the Visible Stepping button, and play your song.

		<div class="endnote">Visible Stepping (<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/visible-stepping.png" alt="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" title="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" />) can be useful when reading code because you can see what block is running.</div>
		
		<h3>Looping Your Song</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<div class="vocab">
					<p>Repeating the same set of commands (such as with <code>repeat</code> or <code>forever</code>) is called <strong>looping</strong> or <strong>iteration</strong>.</p>
				</div>
				<li>If you haven't already, try using the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="repeat () {}" title="repeat () {}" /> block to repeat a note or a sequence of notes in a song. Play your song with Visible Stepping turned on.</li>
				<li>Try nesting one <code>repeat</code> inside another as in the "Für Elise" example above.</li>
				<li>
					Try using a <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever-full-size.png" alt="forever" title="forever" /> block to repeat a command (or group of commands) forever, and play your song with Visible Stepping on.
                    <div class="narrower" style="clear: right;">The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you stop it. You can <strong>click the red stop sign</strong>, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="red stop button" title="red stop button"/>, to stop your code from running.</div>
				</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" /></li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you used command blocks to tell the computer which notes to play, sequencing to order the command blocks, and <em>iteration</em> to repeat the commands.</div>
