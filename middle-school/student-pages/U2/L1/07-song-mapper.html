		<h2>Song <code>Map</code>per</h2>
		<p>Another advantage of using a list to store your notes rather than a long set of <code>play ♪</code> blocks is that you can use higher order functions to process your list.</p>
		<p>In music, notes are part of a scale, and a song can be played higher up a scale or lower down a scale. So if someone naturally has a deep voice, they can sing Twinkle, Twinkle at an octave lower than usual, or if someone has a high voice, they can sing at an octave higher than usual.</p>
		<p>Each octave is 12 notes higher than the previous octave, since there are 12 notes in a scale. So we can add 12 to each note to find the higher version of the note, or subtract 12 to find the lower.</p>
		<p>This is a perfect opportunity to use the <code>map</code> block. It's a block that operates on lists, applying an operation to each item in a list, and reporting back a list with the transformed items.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="1">
				<li>Drag the <code>map</code> block into the main area. Drag one of your note sequence lists into the list icon on the block, so the <code>map</code> block knows what list it's transforming.</li>
				<li>
					Now the question is, how do you want to transform each note? You can put any operation in the first blank, anything that reports a value. I suggest either a <code>+</code> block or <code>-</code> block. Leave one of the blanks empty and put 12 in the other blank. Something like this:<br />

				</li>
				<li>Finally, drag this whole map block into one of the play line blocks. Click the block to hear what happens. Change the + to a -, or change the amount being added/subtracted, and click again to hear the difference. Try it with your other songs too!</li>

		<h2>Coordinating Data</h2>
		
		<div class="todo">Maybe do transpose before the ADT and then let the ADT stuff be optional pages because it gets complex with the transpose mixed in.</div>
		<p>You've used the <code>for each</code> block to traverse a list and to <code>play ♪</code> for each note in a list, but it would be nice to be able to control the number of <var>beats</var> for which each note plays.</p>
		<p>You can use the <code>note beat</code> block to store a bunch of notes and beats together and
