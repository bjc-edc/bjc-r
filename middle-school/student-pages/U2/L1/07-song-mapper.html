		<h2>Song <code>Map</code>per</h2>
		<div class="todo">MARY TODO: add a reminder about how the blank in the functional input to MAP works. --MF, 2/27/22</div>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will use the <code>map</code> block to transpose (shift) all the pitches in your song.</div>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>Pamela, I debated whether to teach the ADT first so they can traverse a 2D list or to show them how to use MAP to transpose first. I went with MAP first and letting 2D lists/ADTs be a later optional page (perhaps not even to be written now or perhaps just a "Take It Further" on the last page) since the goal of the course is functional, and MAP would align with that. There is no real need to teach ADTs although the context does naturally inspire it. --MF, 2/12/22</p>
		</div>
		<div class="todo"><p>When transposing a song, it's	especially important not to call MIDI note numbers "pitch."  The actual pitches are in a geometric progression, not a linear one, and when you transpose by <i>n</i> steps you're actually <em>multiplying</em> the pitches by <span class="katex">(\sqrt[12]{2})^n</span>. --bh 3/3/22</p><p>I agree to rename the variable for next year. --MF, 3/6/22</p></div>

			Another advantage of using a list to store your notes is that you can use higher order functions to process your list. You can use <code>map</code> to play a song higher or lower than the original pitches.<br />

			If you store the list of pitches in a variable, you can use <code>play song</code> together with <code>map</code> to play the same song several times in different ways.<br />

		<p>The <code>map</code> block takes two inputs: a function (in this case <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/plus-3.png" alt="( ) + (3)" title="( ) + (3)" />) and a list, applies the function to each item in the list, and reports a new list of the results.</p>
