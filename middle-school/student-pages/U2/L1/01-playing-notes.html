2-AP-14
Create procedures with parameters to organize code and make it easier to reuse.
Students should create procedures and/or functions that are used multiple times within a program to repeat groups of instructions. These procedures can be generalized by defining parameters that create different outputs for a wide range of inputs. For example, a procedure to draw a circle involves many instructions, but all of them can be invoked with one instruction, such as “drawCircle.” By adding a radius parameter, the user can easily draw circles of different sizes.
Practice(s): Developing and Using Abstractions: 4.1, 4.3

		<div class="learn">In this lab, you'll teach the computer to play some simple songs and move those songs up and down the musical scale.</div>
		<h3>Playing singles notes</h3>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>First download the starter project: <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=pamelafox-ucb&ProjectName=Song%20Player&editMode" title="" target="_blank">Song Player</a>.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Snap provides a built-in block for playing notes, the <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/play-note-60-for-0.5-beats.png" alt="play note (60) for (0.5) beats" title="play note (60) for (0.5) beats" /> block.</p>
		<p>
			This block takes two input parameters:
			<ul>
				<li>The first input parameter is the note to play, a number from 0 to 127. If you're familiar with music, the number 60 represents the Middle C. When you click on the number in the block, a little piano will actually pop up and you can select a note that way.</li>
				<li>The second input parameter is how long to play the note for. It defaults to 0.5 beats, but you can increase it or decrease it however you'd like.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<div class="endnote">Tip: You can also right click the block and select "help" to see an explanation of how to use built-in blocks.</div>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>Play around with the parameters, clicking the block each time to see how the note changes. What happens if you pick a really small number, like 0? What about a big number like 127?</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	

		<h3>Command blocks</h3>
		<p>In the first lab, we mentioned that there are multiple kinds of blocks in Snap. We've mostly been using reporter blocks so far, blocks that compute some value and report it back. The <code>play note</code> block is an example of a command block, a block that commands the computer to do something. In this case, it commands the computer to play a sound. In other cases, command blocks command the computer to draw something on the screen.</p>
		<p>In either case, a command block does <em>not</em> report anything back, so we can't use the result of a command block as the input to another block. There is no result!</p>
