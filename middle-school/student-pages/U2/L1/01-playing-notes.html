				If we teach both of the above blocks as FYTD and also these two and the concept of sampling rate, we'll be in better shape for sound generator...<br /><code>samples of sound</code>, <code>new sound rate</code>

				<li>Open this <a class="js-run-v7 snap-project" href="/bjc-r/middle-school/prog/U2/lab01/song-player.xml" title="Song Player - Snap! project" target="_blank">Song Player</a> project, and save it to your account. It includes a <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-emoji-note.png" alt="play ♪ pitch: () beats: ()" title="play ♪ pitch: () beats: ()" /> <em>command</em> block that takes two inputs: a note to play (<var>pitch</var>) and how long to play it (<var>beats</var>).</li>
                                <div class="todo">
									<p>It took me longer to find this block since it was a custom block at the end of the palette. Is the only reason you made a wrapper block so that you could rename pitch to note? Feels confusing how similar it is to the built-in block, which is also revealed in the palette, so I did a double take deciding which to use. -PF 2/10/22</p>
									<ul><li>Ugh, yes. This was one of the many things that has delayed this lab. ;) The problem was how to set up the ADT when the note has two parts, one of which is also called note. I've hidden the original <code>play note</code> block. --MF, 2/10/22</li></ul>
                                	<p><strong>Latest update:</strong> At the second focus group, teachers expressed enthusiasm for the microworld style (with the limited palette). Since we've offered a good bit of the sound palette here, I've updated the XML with more of the blocks suggested on this page <em>showing in the scripting area</em>. What do you think of this model? --MF, 2/11/22</p>
								</div>
				<div class="endnote" style="clear: right;">
					<p>The <var>pitch</var> tells the computer which note to play. It can be any whole number from 0 to 127. The number 60 represents the note known as <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_C" title="middle C" target="_blank">middle C</a>. If you click the triangle, a piano menu will open, and you can hear the note you are selecting.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-emoji-note-piano-menu.png" alt="image of 'play note (60) for (0.5) beats' block with piano menu open for first input slot and middle C selected and labeled 'C(60)'" title="image of 'play note (60) for (0.5) beats' block with piano menu open for first input slot and middle C selected and labeled 'C(60)'" />
					</p>
					<p>The number of <var>beats</var> tells the computer how long to play the note. By default, Snap<em>!</em> plays 60 beats per minute (bpm), so playing a note for 1 beat takes 1 second. You can change the number of beats per minute by using <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-tempo.png" alt="set tempo to () bpm" title="set tempo to () bpm" />.</p>
				</div>
				<li>Change the inputs to the <code>play ♪</code> block and then click it, and then change the inputs and click it again to see how the note changes.</li>
				<div class="sidenote"><strong>Tip:</strong> Right click a block and select "help" to see an explanation of how to use it.</div>
				<li>Attach several <code>play ♪</code> blocks together one after another to begin creating a song. 
					<ul>
						<li>You can use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/rest.png" alt="rest for () beats" title="rest for () beats" /> to create breaks in your song.</li>
						<li>You can use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="repeat () {}" title="repeat () {}" /> block to repeat any command (or group of commands) a specific number of times. Any code you put inside the C-shape of the <code>repeat</code> block will be repeated. Anything above it will happen before; anything below will happen after. </li>
						<div class="todo">Did an earlier lab already give repeat a thorough introduction? I was surprised to see it so casually introduced, since looping is usually A Big Deal when I teach it in text-based coding classes. It's certainly easier in block-based, but I feel like it warrants its own section, so that you can talk about what goes in the loop vs. out of the loop (i.e. set-instrument can just be outside the loop, no need to repeat it twice). -PF 2/10/22<p>This is here on the principle of "experience before formality."  The idea is that they have the opportunity (not required) to play with it and try to see what it does before it is formally thought. I thought that might work well with REPEAT since it does exactly what is says. ;) I added a little extra text to help. We can ask teacher for feedback about it... <strong>(Mary TODO)</strong> Does that seem sensible? What do you think, Brian? --MF, 2/10/22</div>
						<li>You can also use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-instrument-to.png" alt="set instrument to (1)" title="set instrument to (1)" /> to change the instrument, <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-tempo.png" alt="set tempo to () bpm" title="set tempo to () bpm" /> to change the tempo (beats per minute), or <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-volume-to-100.png" alt="set volume to () %" title="set volume to () %" /> to change the volume. Wherever you put one of these blocks, the sound will change from that point on.</li>
