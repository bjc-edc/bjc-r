				If we teach both of the above blocks as FYTD and also these two and the concept of sampling rate, we'll be in better shape for sound generator...<br /><code>samples of sound</code>, <code>new sound rate</code>

				<div class="vocabBig"><p>A <strong>command</strong> block tells the computer to do something <em>without reporting a value</em>.</p></div>
				<div class="comment">Is it worth pointing out the visual difference between command blocks and reporter blocks, the borders/snap tab thingies? Maybe we did that earlier already? -PF 2/10/22</div>
                                <div class="comment">This XML opened with a non-unified palette for me. - PF 2/10/22</div>
				<li>Open this <a class="js-run-v7 snap-project" href="/bjc-r/middle-school/prog/U2/lab01/song-player.xml" title="Song Player - Snap! project" target="_blank">Song Player</a> project, and save it to your account. It includes a <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-emoji-note.png" alt="play ♪ pitch: () beats: ()" title="play ♪ pitch: () beats: ()" /> <em>command</em> block that takes two inputs: a note to play (<var>pitch</var>) and how long to play it (<var>beats</var>).</li>
                                <div class="comment">It took me longer to find this block since it was a custom block at the end of the palette. Is the only reason you made a wrapper block so that you could rename pitch to note? Feels confusing how similar it is to the built-in block, which is also revealed in the palette, so I did a double take deciding which to use. -PF 2/10/22</div>
				<div class="endnote" style="clear: right;">
					<p>The <var>pitch</var> tells the computer which note to play. It can be any whole number from 0 to 127. The number 60 represents the note middle C. If you click the triangle, a piano menu will open, and you can hear the note you are selecting.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-emoji-note-piano-menu.png" alt="image of 'play note (60) for (0.5) beats' block with piano menu open for first input slot and middle C selected and labeled 'C(60)'" title="image of 'play note (60) for (0.5) beats' block with piano menu open for first input slot and middle C selected and labeled 'C(60)'" />
					</p>
                                        <div class="comment">Will 'middle C' be a familiar phrase to everyone? I remember learning about 'C' as a kid but I forget about middle C. I'm really bad at music. I wonder if it'd be kinder to music newbies to say 'the note known as middle C' with a newbie-friendly link that explains notes? - PF 2/10/22</div>
					<p>The number of <var>beats</var> tells the computer how long to play the note. The values work just like in music: 1 beat is a whole note, 0.5 beats is a half note, 0.25 beats is a quarter note, etc.</p>
					<div class="todo">Brian is not sure this last sentence is correct, but I don't quite understand the concern. --MF, 1/21/22<br>My partner agrees, since he says that notes are in relation to the segmentation of musics into bars, whereas our beats are in relation to the BPM. Maybe we just say "there are 60 beats per minute (by default), so writing 1 would mean that the note takes 1 second." </div>


				</div>
				<li>Change the inputs to the <code>play ♪</code> block and then click it, and then change the inputs and click it again to see how the note changes.</li>
				<div class="sidenote"><strong>Tip:</strong> Right click a block and select "help" to see an explanation of how to use it.</div>
				<li>Attach several <code>play ♪</code> blocks together one after another to begin creating a song. 
					<ul>
						<li>You can use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/rest.png" alt="rest for () beats" title="rest for () beats" /> to create breaks in your song.</li>
						<li>You can use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="repeat () {}" title="repeat () {}" /> block to repeat any command (or group of commands) a specific number of times. </li>
						<div class="comment">Did an earlier lab already give repeat a thorough introduction? I was surprised to see it so casually introduced, since looping is usually A Big Deal when I teach it in text-based coding classes. It's certainly easier in block-based, but I feel like it warrants its own section, so that you can talk about what goes in the loop vs. out of the loop (i.e. set-instrument can just be outside the loop, no need to repeat it twice). -PF 2/10/22</div>
						<li>You can also use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-instrument-to.png" alt="set instrument to (1)" title="set instrument to (1)" /> to change the instrument, <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-tempo-to-60-bpm.png" alt="set tempo to () bpm" title="set tempo to () bpm" /> to change the tempo (pace), or <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-volume-to-100.png" alt="set volume to () %" title="set volume to () %" /> to change the volume. Wherever you put one of these blocks, the sound will change from that point on.</li>
                                        <div class="comment">Instead of pace, how about "beats per minute"? It seems useful to write out the bpm acronym somewhere just in case its not obvious. -PF 2/10/22</div>
