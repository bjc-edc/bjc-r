				If we teach both of the above blocks as FYTD and also these two and the concept of sampling rate, we'll be in better shape for sound generator...<br /><code>samples of sound</code>, <code>new sound rate</code>

		<h3>Sequencing Commands</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/headphones.png" alt="Set Up Your Headphones or Speakers" title="Set Up Your Headphones or Speakers" /></li>
				<div class="vocabBig"><p>A <strong>command</strong> block tells the computer to do something <em>without reporting a value</em>.</p><div class="todo">Brian doesn't want these in the middle school course. We should discuss as a group. --MF, 1/21/22</div></div>
				<li>Open this <a class="js-run-v7 snap-project" href="/bjc-r/middle-school/prog/U2/lab01/song-player.xml" title="Song Player - Snap! project" target="_blank">Song Player</a> project, and save it to your account. It includes a <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-emoji-note.png" alt="play ♪ pitch: () beats: ()" title="play ♪ pitch: () beats: ()" /> <em>command</em> block that takes two inputs: a note to play (<var>pitch</var>) and how long to play it (<var>beats</var>).</li>
				<div class="endnote" style="clear: right;">
					<p>The <var>pitch</var> tells the computer what note to play. It can be any whole number from 0 to 127, where 60 represents the note middle C. If you click the triangle, a little piano menu will open, and you can hear the note you are selecting.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-emoji-note-piano-menu.png" alt="image of 'play note (60) for (0.5) beats' block with piano menu open for first input slot and middle C selected and labeled 'C(60)'" title="image of 'play note (60) for (0.5) beats' block with piano menu open for first input slot and middle C selected and labeled 'C(60)'" />
					</p>
					<p>The number of <var>beats</var> tells the computer how long to play that note. The values work just like in music: 1 beat is a whole note, 0.5 beats is a half note, 0.25 beats is a quarter note, etc.</p>
					<div class="todo">Brian is not sure this last sentence is correct, but I don't quite understand the concern. --MF, 1/21/22</div>

				</div>
				<li>Change the inputs to the <code>play ♪</code> block and then click it, and then change the inputs and click it again to see how the note changes.</li>
				<div class="vocabBig">
					<p>Connecting several blocks together one after another is called <strong>sequencing</strong>.</p>
				</div>
				<li>Attach several <code>play ♪</code> blocks together one after another to begin creating a song. 
					<ul>
						<li>You can use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/rest.png" alt="rest for () beats" title="rest for () beats" /> to create breaks in your song.</li>
						<li>You can use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="repeat () {}" title="repeat () {}" /> block to repeat any command (or group of commands) a specific number of times. </li>
						<li>You can also use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-instrument-to.png" alt="set instrument to (1)" title="set instrument to (1)" /> to change the instrument, <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-tempo-to-60-bpm.png" alt="set tempo to () bpm" title="set tempo to () bpm" /> to change the tempo (pace), or <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-volume-to-100.png" alt="set volume to () %" title="set volume to () %" /> to change the volume. Wherever you put one of these blocks, the sound will change from that point on.</li>
