			If we teach both of the above blocks as FYTD and also these two and the concept of sampling rate, we'll be in better shape for sound generator...<br /><code>samples of sound</code>, <code>new sound rate</code>

Lesson Plan
[10 minutes] Playing single notes & Command blocks
[10 minutes] Playing note sequences
[15 minutes] Making a new command block
[15 minutes] Transforming sequences

	<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll teach the computer to play some simple songs and move those songs up and down the musical scale.</div>
		
		<h3>Sequencing Commands</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
				<div class="todo">Need to test all XMLs once working</div>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/headphones.png" alt="Set Up Your Headphones or Speakers" title="Set Up Your Headphones or Speakers" /></li>
				<div class="vocab"><p>A <strong>command</strong> block tells the computer to do something <em>without reporting a value</em>.</p></div>
				<li>Open this <a class="js-run-v7 snap-project" href="/bjc-r/middle-school/prog/U2/lab01/song-player.xml" title="Song Player - Snap! project" target="_blank">Song Player</a> project, and save it to your account. It includes a <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/play-note-60-for-0.5-beats.png" alt="play note (60) for (0.5) beats" title="play note (60) for (0.5) beats" /> <em>command</em> block that takes two inputs: a <var>note</var> to play and how many <var>beats</var> to play it. Change the inputs to the <code>play note</code> block, and then click it to see how the note changes.
				</li>
				<div class="endnote" style="clear: right;">
					<p>The <var>note</var> can be any whole number from 0 to 127, where 60 represents the note middle C. If you click the triangle, a little piano menu will open, and you can hear the note you are selecting.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-note-piano-menu.png" alt="image of 'play note (60) for (0.5) beats' block with piano menu open for first input slot and middle C selected and labeled 'C(60)'" title="image of 'play note (60) for (0.5) beats' block with piano menu open for first input slot and middle C selected and labeled 'C(60)'" />
					</p>
					<p>The number of <var>beats</var> tells the computer how long to play that note. The values work just like in music: 1 beat is a whole note, 0.5 beats is a half note, 0.25 beats is a quarter note, etc.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="vocabBig">
					<p>Connecting several blocks together one after another is called <strong>sequencing</strong>.</p>
				</div>

				<li>Attach several <code>play note</code> blocks together one after another to begin creating a song. 
					<ul>
						<li>You can use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/rest.png" alt="rest for () beats" title="rest for () beats" /> to create breaks in your song.</li>
						<li>You can use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="repeat () {}" title="repeat () {}" /> block to repeat any command (or group of commands) a specific number of times. </li>
						<li>You can also use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-instrument-to.png" alt="set instrument to (1)" title="set instrument to (1)" /> to change the instrument, <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-tempo-to-60-bpm.png" alt="set tempo to () bpm" title="set tempo to () bpm" /> to change the tempo (pace), or <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-volume-to-100.png" alt="set volume to () %" title="set volume to () %" /> to change the volume. Wherever you put one of these blocks, the sound will change from that point on.</li>

					</ul> 
					<div class="endnote"><a class="js-run-v7 snap-project" href="/bjc-r/middle-school/prog/U2/lab01/sample-song-player.xml" title="Sample Song Player - Snap! project" target="_blank">Click for an example in Snap<em>!</em>.</a></div>
				<div class="todo">Need to fix XML file here.</div>
