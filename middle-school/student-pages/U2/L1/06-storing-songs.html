			In the <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U1/L2/03-creating-editing-blocks.html?topic=middle-school%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 2: Super Short Stories, Activity 3: Creating and Editing Blocks" target="_blank">Super Short Stories</a> lab, you began using <em>local variables</em> to access the inputs to a block you were editing. Those variables were only available within that block.<br />

			When you need a variable to be available <em>anywhere</em> in your project, you can use a <em>global variable</em>.

        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Global Variable</strong>
            <p>A <strong>global variable</strong> is a variable that is usable by all scripts in the program.</p>
        </div>
		<p>
			For example, you can use a global variable to store the pitches of a song.<br />

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your latest project isn't open already, log in to Snap!, and open your "Song Player" project.</li>
				<li>
					Create a global variable to store your song. Here's how...
					<div class="narrower">
						<h4><strong>Making a Global Variable</strong></h4>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Click <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/make-a-variable.png" alt="make a variable button" title="make a variable button" />  in the Variables palette.  (It's not a block; you can't drag it into the scripting area.)</li>
							<li>Type the title for your variable. (Use the name of the song or something else to help you remember it.)</li>
							<li>Click "OK."</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					Set your global variable to store your song. Here's how...
					<div class="narrower">
						<h4><strong>Setting a Global Variable</strong></h4>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Drag the <code>set variable</code> block out of the Variables palette and into the scripting area.</li>
							<li>In the first input slot, select the name of your global variable.</li>
							<li>Drag the <code>list</code> block with your song pitches into the second input slot.</li>
							<li>Click the <code>set variable</code> block to run it.</li>
							<li>Notice that a watcher containing the pitches to your song appears on the Snap<em>!</em> stage. <div class="todo">Add a stage PNG here. --MF, 2/21/22</div></li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					Use your global variable in your <code>play song</code> block.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-song-mary-lamb.png" alt="play song (Mary Had a Little Lamb)" title="play song (Mary Had a Little Lamb)" />
				</li>
				<li>Create another global variable and make it store a different song.<div class="todo">Add a second image just for fun. --MF, 2/21/22</div></li>
				<li>Try out both of your variables in your <code>play song</code> block, and make sure that they work.</li>
				<li>Your global variables will appear as a watcher on the Snap<em>!</em> stage. You can use the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/show-variable-full-size.png" alt="show variable" title="show variable" /> and <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/hide-variable-full-size.png" alt="hide variable" title="hide variable" /> blocks to control whether any one of your variables shows on the stage. Try showing and hiding your variables.</li>				
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you stored notes in variables and used your <code>play song</code> block to play them.</div>
