			<p>Pamela, you might like to skim around. I'm debating whether to teach the ADT first so they can traverse a 2D list or to show them how to use MAP to transpose first. I'm leaning toward MAP first and letting 2D lists/ADTs be a later optional page (perhaps not even to be written now or perhaps just a "Take It Further" on the last page) since the goal of the course is functional, and MAP would align with that. There is no real need to teach ADTs although the context does naturally inspire it. --MF, 2/12/22</p>

Those variables were only available within that block. When you need a variable to be available anywhere in your project, you can use a <em>global variable</em>.<br />
