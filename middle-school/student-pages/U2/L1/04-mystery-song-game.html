		<h2>Mystery Song Game</h2>
		<div class="todo">Dan wants a "Guess the song" activity. Maybe even a song player that plays any number of songs and then you guess what it was. --MF, 1/4/22</div>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will create a game where the user has to guess the name of the song played.</div>
		
		<div class="learn">In this activity, </div>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Play your song for someone else, and see if they can guess what it is; guess the song for someone else.</li>

		<div class="todo">Have them use command <code>ask</code> and command <code>if</code> together with <code>say</code> to test the user's guess.

			There are command block versions of two blocks you've already seen:
			<ul>
				<li>
					You've used the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" /> reporter. Snap<em>!</em> also 	has a built-in command version: 
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if-else-full-size.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then 'C-shaped input slot' else 'C-shaped input slot'" title="if 'predicate input slot' then 'C-shaped input slot' else 'C-shaped input slot'" />
					<div class="endnote">
						<a href="#hint-if" data-toggle="collapse" title="Learn more about the difference between the reporter IF THEN ELSE and the command IF ELSE.">Learn more about the difference between the reporter <code>if then else</code> and the command <code>if else</code>.</a>
						<div id="hint-if" class="collapse">

								In <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U1/L6/02-l33t-text.html?topic=middle-school%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 6 Activity 2: L33t Text">Unit 1 Lab 6 Activity 2: L33t Text</a>, you used <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" /> to decide what the computer should <em>report</em>. You can use the command version to decide what the computer should <em>do</em>. Like the reporter version, the command <code>if else</code> block takes three inputs:
								<ol>
									<li>A testing condition (such as <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/answer-equals-stronger.png" alt="(answer) = ('Stronger')" title="(answer) = ('Stronger')" />)</li>
									<li>What to do if it's true</li>
									<li>What to do if it's false</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
							<p>The command block, however, performs a set of <em>commands</em> depending on the result of the condition rather than <em>reporting</em> an output.</p>

					You've used the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/ask.png" alt="ask ()" title="ask ()" /> reporter. Snap<em>!</em> has a built-in command version:
