		<h2>Mystery Song Game</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will use your <code>mystery song</code> block to create a game.</div>
		
		<div class="todo">I'm debating whether the following two yellow boxes should actually <em>not</em> be hidden behind a click and just be visible yellow boxes. Thoughts? --MF, 2/10/22</div>
		<p>
			There are command block versions of two blocks you've already seen:
			<ul>
				<li>
					You've used the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" /> reporter. Snap<em>!</em> also 	has a built-in command version: 
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if-else-full-size.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then 'C-shaped input slot' else 'C-shaped input slot'" title="if 'predicate input slot' then 'C-shaped input slot' else 'C-shaped input slot'" />
					<div class="endnote">
						<a href="#hint-if" data-toggle="collapse" title="Learn more about the difference between the reporter IF THEN ELSE and the command IF ELSE.">Learn more about the difference between the reporter <code>if then else</code> and the command <code>if else</code>.</a>

You can use the command version to decide what the computer should <em>do</em>. Like the reporter version, the command <code>if else</code> block takes three inputs:
								<ol>
									<li>A testing condition (such as <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/answer-equals-stronger.png" alt="(answer) = ('Stronger')" title="(answer) = ('Stronger')" />)</li>
									<li>What to do if it's true</li>
									<li>What to do if it's false</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
							<p>The command block, however, performs a set of commands depending on the result of the condition rather than reporting an output.</p>

				</li>

					You've used the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab07/ask.png" alt="ask ()" title="ask ()" /> reporter. Snap<em>!</em> has a built-in command version: 
					<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/ask-empty-full-size.png" alt="ask () and wait" title="ask () and wait" />, which uses 
					<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/answer-full-size.png" alt="answer" title="answer" /> to report the user's response.

To use Snap<em>!</em>'s built-in version, first use the command <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/ask-empty-full-size.png" alt="ask () and wait" title="ask () and wait" /> to ask the user your question and then use the reporter <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/answer-full-size.png" alt="answer" title="answer" /> to access the answer stored the last time <code>ask and wait</code> was run.

					Create a script that plays your mystery song, asks the user what song they think it is, and then tells them whether they are right or wrong.
					<div class="todo">I think this is a little tricky. How's the following for scaffolding? At the last focus group, we got the message that some kids do better with more scaffolding than we are giving <em>and</em> that teachers' CS goals for middle school prioritize engagement over formal CS content which will occur in HS if we hook them now. They were convincing, and I added a final hint here.  --MF, 2/11/22</div>

						<p>You can use <code>ask and wait</code> to ask the user a question (and store their response), and you can use <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-empty-full-size.png" alt="say () for () secs" title="say () for () secs" /> to tell the user something without collecting or storing any response.</p>

								The script for your game needs to do three things:

		<div class="todo">We haven't been doing that many TIFs, but I thought of this one, and I made it a TIF because I think it's a bit of a stretch. --MF, 2/11/22</div>

			<ol type="A">
				<li>If you created two mystery songs, you could make a new command block that randomly chooses which one to play by using <code>random</code> together with <code>if else</code>. </li>
				<div class="todo">I like this idea, but I don't see a way to do more than two mystery songs with the blocks they know at this point. Am I missing anything? --MF, 2/10/22</div>
