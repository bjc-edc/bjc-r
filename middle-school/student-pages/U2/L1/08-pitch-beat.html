		<h2>Songs with Pitches <em>and</em> Beats</h2>
		
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will learn to store and play songs with both pitch and length of each note.</div>
		<p>
			So far, you've been using a <code>play song</code> block that only lets you control the pitch of each note (by giving it a list of pitches as input). The number of beats was the same based on whatever you typed into the <code>play ♪</code> block inside your <code>play song</code> block (for example, 0.5 in the image below).<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-song-definition.png" alt="play song (pitches) {
	for each (pitche) in (pitches) {
		play ♪ pitch: (pitch) beats: (0.5)
	}
}" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			You can use a table to store both pieces of data for each note and then use the <code>play song with pitches and beats</code> block, which expects music data <em>in a table</em>.<br />

		<div class="todo">Pamela, I'm leaning toward dropping the <code>play ♪</code> block. Not only is it easily confused with the <code>play ♪ pitch: () beats: ()</code> block (which I've been calling <code>play ♪</code>), but also, it obscures understanding of what's going with the processing of the table. What do you think of that and the following yellow box? --MF, 2/24/22</div>
		<div class="endnote">
			<p><a href="#hint-play-beats" data-toggle="collapse" title="How does the PLAY SONG WITH PITCHES AND BEATS block work?">How does the <code>play song with pitches and beats</code> block work?</a></p>
			<div id="hint-play-beats" class="collapse">
				<p>
					This block takes a table of pitch and beat values as input, and for each note in the song, it plays the pitch and beat values for that note:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-song-beats-definition.png" alt="play song with pitches and beats (song) {
	for each (♪) in (song) {
		play ♪ pitch: (pitch from ♪ (♪)) beats: (beats from ♪ (♪))
	}
}" title="play song with pitches and beats (song) {
	for each (♪) in (song) {
		play ♪ pitch: (pitch from ♪ (♪)) beats: (beats from ♪ (♪))
	}
}" />
				</p>
				<p>
					The data about each note is loaded in to the table using the <code>♪ pitch beats</code> block, which takes a pitch and number of beats as input and reports a list with those two values:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/note-pitch-beats-definition.png" alt="♪ pitch: (pitch) beats: (beats) {
		report (list (pitch) (beats))
	}" title="♪ pitch: (pitch) beats: (beats) {
		report (list (pitch) (beats))
	}" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/note-pitch-beats-reporting.png" alt="♪ pitch: (64) beats: (0.25) reporting the list 64, 0.25" title="♪ pitch: (64) beats: (0.25) reporting the list 64, 0.25" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Each note (<var>♪</var>) in the song now has both pitch and beat information, and <code>play ♪</code> needs to receive those data in separate input slots. The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/pitch.png" alt="pitch from ♪" title="pitch from ♪" /> and <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/beats.png" alt="beats from ♪" title="beats from ♪" /> blocks each take a note (<var>♪</var>) as input and report only one piece of information to the <code>play ♪</code> block.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/pitch-definition.png" alt="pitch (♪) {
		report (item (1) of (♪))
	}" title="pitch (♪) {
