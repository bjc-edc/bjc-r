		<h2>Songs with Pitches <em>and</em> Beats</h2>
		
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will learn to store and play songs with both pitch and length of each note.</div>
		<p>
			So far, you've been using a <code>play song</code> block that only lets you control the pitch of each note (by giving it a list of pitches as input). The number of beats was the same based on whatever you typed into the <code>play ♪</code> block inside your <code>play song</code> block (for example, 0.5 in the image below).<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-song-definition.png" alt="play song (pitches) {
	for each (pitche) in (pitches) {
		play ♪ pitch: (pitch) beats: (0.5)
	}
}" title="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-song-definition.png" alt="play song (pitches) {
	for each (pitche) in (pitches) {
		play ♪ pitch: (pitch) beats: (0.5)
	}
}" />
		</p>
		<p>
			You can use a table to store both pieces of data for each note and then use the <code>play song with pitches and beats</code> block, which expects music data <em>in a table</em>.<br />

		<div class="todo">Pamela, I'm leaning toward dropping the <code>play ♪</code> block from the XML files. Not only is it easily confused with the <code>play ♪ pitch: () beats: ()</code> block (which I've been calling <code>play ♪</code> in the text), but also, it obscures understanding of what's going with the processing of the table, which I'm explaining in the yellow box below. What do you think of this plan? --MF, 2/24/22</div>
		<div class="todo"><strong>This block is not in any of the XML files yet</strong>. I need to do that and give it help text. In the meantime, you can review by seeing what it is supposed to be in the yellow box below. (It takes a while to update all the XML files, and since I want to hear from you, Pamela, before I cut the <code>play ♪</code> block, I'm going to wait and do the next round of XML edits at once.) --MF, 2/27/22 
			<p>NOTE TO MARY: when I add the block, I should take it from the MARIO MAPPED EXMAPLE because that version has the help text as a comment on the hat block. --MF, 2/27/22</p></div>

					This block takes a table of pitch and beat values as input, and for each note in the song, it plays the pitch and beat values for that note:<br />

					The data about each note is loaded in to a table using the <code>♪ pitch beats</code> block, which takes a pitch and number of beats as input and reports a list with those two values:<br />

				<p>
					Each note (<var>♪</var>) in the song now has both pitch and beat information, and <code>play ♪</code> needs to receive those data in separate input slots. The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/pitch.png" alt="pitch from ♪" title="pitch from ♪" /> and <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/beats.png" alt="beats from ♪" title="beats from ♪" /> blocks each take a note (<var>♪</var>) as input and report only one piece of information to the <code>play ♪</code> block.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/pitch-definition.png" alt="pitch (♪) {
		report (item (1) of (♪))
	}" title="pitch (♪) {
		report (item (1) of (♪))
	}" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/beats-definition.png" alt="beats (♪) {
		report (item (2) of (♪))
	}" title="beats (♪) {
		report (item (2) of (♪))
	}" />
				</p>
				<p>
					So, <code>play song with pitches and beats</code> takes a table of song data with pitches and beats as input (<code>song</code>), and it plays each note (<var>♪</var>) at the specified pitch for the specified number of beats.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-song-beats-definition.png" alt="play song with pitches and beats (song) {

	for each (♪) in (song) {
