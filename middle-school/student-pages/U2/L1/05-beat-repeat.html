		<p>Using the <code>repeat</code> block strategically can make your code shorter and easier to read. It's generally a good idea to write shorter code that is easier to read because when something isn't working right, it's easier to find and fix the problem, or when you want to change it later or have someone else read it, that's easier too.</p>

			Another way to simplify writing a song is to use a list to store the notes and then play each note in the list. You can use <code>for each</code> to run a command (or group of commands) for each item in a list. For example: <br />
			<a class="js-run-v7 snap-project" href="/bjc-r/middle-school/prog/U2/lab01/example-for-each.xml" title="Example of For Each - Snap! project" target="_blank"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/example-for-each.png" alt="for each (pitch) in (list (60) (60) (67) (67) (69) (69) (67) (0) (65) (65) (64) (64) (62) (62) (60) (0)) {
	play ♪ pitch: (pitch) beats: (0.5)
}" title="for each (pitch) in (list (60) (60) (67) (67) (69) (69) (67) (0) (65) (65) (64) (64) (62) (62) (60) (0)) {
	play ♪ pitch: (pitch) beats: (0.5)
}" /></a>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>
					Create a simple song using <code>for each</code>.
					<ol>
						<li>Drag a <code>for each</code> block into the scripting area.</li>
						<li>Drag a <code>play ♪</code> block inside it.</li>
						<li>
							Rename the <var>item</var> variable to <var>pitch</var> by clicking it, typing the new name, and clicking "OK."
							<div class="todo">An animation would be nice here one day. --MF, 2/11/22</div>
						</li>
						<li>Drag the <var>pitch</var> variable into the first input of the <code>play ♪</code> block. Dragging will make a copy of <var>pitch</var>, so you should see <var>pitch</var> in both places</li>
						<li>
							Drag a <code>list</code> block into the list input slot of the <code>for each</code> block, add some notes, and click the script to test out your song as you build it.
							<div class="todo">An animation here too would be nice here one day. --MF, 2/11/22</div>
						</li>
						<div class="endnote">If you want to add or remove a pitch from your list, you don't have to move the other numbers around. To add a new slot, right-click the place where you want it to appear, and select "insert a slot." To remove a slot, right-click it, and select "delete slot." </div>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Create a new command block called <code>play song</code> that takes a list of notes as input and plays each note in the list.<div class="todo">I still need to add some scaffolding here about using the FOR EACH code they already have, removing the existing list, and dragging in the local var. --MF, 2/12/22</div></li>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you used <code>for each</code> to play each pitch in a list.</div>
