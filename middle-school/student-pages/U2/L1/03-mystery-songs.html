		<h2>Mystery Songs</h2>
		<div class="todo">Dan wants a "Guess the song" activity. Maybe even a song player that plays any number of songs and then you guess what it was. --MF, 1/4/22</div>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will create a game where the user has to guess the name of the song played.</div>
		<h3>Commands Versus Reporters</h3>
		<p>
			Before this unit, you mostly used <em>reporter</em> blocks to compute a value and report it (either to you or to another block). The blocks you've been using in this lab are <em>command</em> blocks; they tell the computer to do something, (play a sound, draw, move, change something, etc.).<br />

				A <strong>reporter</strong> block does a calculation and reports the result. Reporters have an oval shape. <br />

			<p>
				A <strong>predicate</strong> is a special kind of reporter that asks a true/false question and reports either true or false. Predicates have a hexagon shape.<br />

			<div class="sidenote">You'll use commands much more in Unit 2.</div>
			<p>
				A <strong>command</strong> block tells the computer to do something <em>without reporting a value</em>. Commands have a puzzle shape and can be snapped together one after another. <br />

			There are command block versions of two blocks you've already seen:
			<ul>
				<li>
					You've used the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" /> reporter. Snap<em>!</em> also 	has a built-in command version:

You can use the command version to decide what the computer should <em>do</em>. Like the reporter version, the command <code>if else</code> block takes three inputs:
								<ol>
									<li>A testing condition (such as <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/answer-equals-stronger.png" alt="(answer) = ('Stronger')" title="(answer) = ('Stronger')" />)</li>
									<li>What to do if it's true</li>
									<li>What to do if it's false</li>
								</ol>

							<p>The command block, however, performs a set of <em>commands</em> depending on the result of the condition rather than <em>reporting</em> an output.</p>
