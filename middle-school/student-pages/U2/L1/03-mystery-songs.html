		<h2>Programming Styles</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll learn about the difference between programming by nesting blocks inside each other and programming by stacking blocks top to bottom.</div>

		<h3>Commands Versus Reporters</h3>
		<div class="todo">Share with Pamela and Brian for review.</div>
		<p>Before this unit, you've been nesting blocks inside each other so that the output reported by one block becomes the input to another. This style of programming is known as <em>functional programming</em>, and in Snap<em>!</em>, it primarily uses <em>reporter</em> blocks. A reporter computes a value and reports it (to you or to other blocks).<br />

		</p>
		<p>In this unit, you've been stacking one atop the other blocks that change things. This style of programming is called <em>imperative programming</em>. In Snap<em>!</em>, imperative programming uses <em>command</em> blocks. A command tells the computer to do something, (play a sound, draw, move, change something, etc.). Commands have effects.</p>

				A <strong>reporter</strong> block does a calculation and reports the result. Reporters have an oval shape. <br />

			<p>
				A <strong>predicate</strong> is a special kind of reporter that asks a true/false question and reports either true or false. Predicates have a hexagon shape.<br />

			</p>
			<div class="sidenote">You'll use commands much more in Unit 2.</div>
			<p>
				A <strong>command</strong> block tells the computer to do something <em>without reporting a value</em>. Commands have a puzzle shape and can be snapped together one after another. <br />

			<div class="endnote" style="clear: right;">Unlike reporters, a command block doesn't report anything, so you can't use its result as the input to another block&mdash;there is no result!</div>

		<h3>Creating a Command Block</h3>
		<p>You've created a reporter block before. You can create a command block in almost exactly the same way.

You can use the command version to decide what the computer should <em>do</em>. Like the reporter version, the command <code>if else</code> block takes three inputs:

									<li>What to do if it's true</li>
									<li>What to do if it's false</li>

							<p>The command block, however, performs a set of <em>commands</em> depending on the result of the condition rather than <em>reporting</em> an output.</p>
