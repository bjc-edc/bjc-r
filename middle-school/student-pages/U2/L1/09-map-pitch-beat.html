		<h2><code>Map</code>ping over Pitches and Beats</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will learn how to transpose data in a song that is stored in a table.</div>

		<p>
			You've learned how to use <code>map</code> to transpose (shift) all the pitch values in a song where each note plays for the same length, and you've learned how to use a table to store both pitch and beat values for the notes in a song. You can also transpose the pitch values stored in a table.<br />

			This code is a bit complicated. Notice that it plays a version of <var>Mario Theme</var> that has gone through the <code>map</code> block. So the question is: What does this <code>map</code> block do?
		</p>
		<div class="todo">Obviously, this whole page a bit of a reach, but I feel like the question will arise for some kids of how to do this, and so I want to offer something for them (even if they just read it on their own time). In the TG, this will be listed as optional. Any suggestions for improving this presentation? --MF, 2/27/22</div>

			Recall that <code>play song with pitches and beats</code> expects a table of song data as input, <code>map</code> works through every item in a list, and every item in the table of pitches and beats is one note. So, <code>map</code> applies a function to every note in the <var>Mario Theme</var> and  outputs a table of notes (pairs of pitches and beats).<br />

			In order for <code>map</code> to output a table of pitches and beats, it needs to apply a function that outputs pairs of pitches and beats. So the code should a play version of <var>Mario Theme (with beats)</var> that has gone through a <code>map</code> block to apply a function that outputs pitches and beats. So the code needs a structure like this:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-song-beats-mario-map01.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			What function outputs pitches and beats? The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/note-pitch-beats.png" alt="♪ pitch () beats ()" title="♪ pitch () beats ()" /> block. So the code needs a structure like this:<br />
			<div class="comment">Needs alt-title text. --MF, 2/27/22</div>
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-song-beats-mario-map02.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>But remember that the inputs that end up in the blank spots of the function in the <code>map</code> block each time it applies the function are the items in the input list, which in this case are the notes (pitches and beats from <var>Mario Theme (with beats)</var>).</p>
		<p>
			So, to get a beats value in the beats slot, we need to use the <code>beats from ♪</code> block, which takes a note (with a pitch and a beat) and reports just the beat.<br />

			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/play-song-beats-mario-map03.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			And to get a pitch value in the pitch slot, we need to use the <code>pitches from ♪</code> block, and we need to add our shift value to do the transpose.<br />

							<strong>Tip:</strong> shifts of 5, 7, and 12 sound good together. <a href="#hint-music-theory" data-toggle="collapse" title="Who do shifts of 5, 7, and 12 sound good together?">Why?</a>
							<div id="hint-music-theory" class="collapse"><p>There is a music theory reason for this: 12 works well because shifts of 12&mdash;either added or subtracted&mdash;shift the pitches up or down an octave; 7 works well because shifting up 7 pitches makes a perfect fifth; and 5 works well because 12 - 7 = 5, and so that's a perfect fifth also.</p></div>

						<p>I don't know that I'm more musical, but this "tip" led me to expect that the transposed song would be played <em>in parallel with</em> the original, to make chords.  Playing them in sequence is much less dependent on picking a simple interval. --bh 3/3/22</p>

				<li>
					Do you have an idea for a different way to transpose a song that has both pitch and beat information? Try to build it. If it works, explain how it works to someone else. If it doesn't work, talk with someone else and figure out why it doesn't work.

I would go through the whole curriculum, find all of these, and remove them. --bh 3/3/22</div>
Understanding why code you thought would work doesn't actually work is an important part of programming.</div>
