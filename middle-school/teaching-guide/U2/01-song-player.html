		<h2>Lab 1: Song Player</h2>
		<p>After Unit 1 introduced programming in the functional style (using procedures that report values rather than <em>change</em> variables' values, and using procedures themselves as data), Unit 2 introduces imperative programming (using procedures that produce effects&mdash;sounds, movement on the Stage, and other changes to the state of the program). Lab 1 uses the sequential nature of music as a context for learning about iteration (repetition), visible stepping (a Snap<em>!</em> debugging tool), creating command blocks (blocks with effects), exploring the command versions of blocks of which students have already used reporter versions: <code>if else</code> and <code>ask and wait</code> (and its pair <code>answer</code>), and list traversal. Along the way, students review use of the higher order function <code>map</code> and gain informal experience with the abstract data type, <var>♪</var> (pronounced "note"), which contains both a pitch and a beat for any note in a song.</p> 
		<div class="endnote">
            <p>This curriculum focuses on giving students an engaging, strong foundation in programming without formalizing all ideas presented. Students don't need to learn this, but teachers may find it useful to know that an <strong>abstract data type (ADT)</strong> is a custom data type that's meaningful within a program.</p>
			<p>An ADT is not built into the language (like common data types such as "number", "text", or "list"); the programmer develops it as they code. An abstract data type may include a constructor (such as <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/note-pitch-beats.png" alt="♪ pitch: () beats: ()" title="♪ pitch: () beats: ()" />), which constructs one instance of the data structure, and one or more selectors (such as <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/pitch.png" alt="pitch from ♪" title="pitch from ♪" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab01/beats.png" alt="beats from ♪" title="beats from ♪" />), which each select one piece of the data structure. The constructor and selector(s) together implement the abstract data type. </p>
			<p>You can learn more about the ADT used in this project in <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U2/L1/08-pitch-beat.html?topic=middle-school%2F2-sequencing-iteration.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Activity 9: Mapping over Pitches and Beats">Activity 9: <code>Map</code>ping over Pitches and Beats</a> in the box labeled "How does the <code>play song with pitches and beats</code> block work?"</p>
		</div>
		<p>This lab can be presented without <em>any</em> formal teaching. Students can work directly from the activity pages with the teacher walking around asking and answering questions. If you choose to bring the class together to present or discuss some idea, consider waiting until after students have gained some hands on experience and perhaps even constructively struggled with the concept first.</p>

						<li>Use the Snap<em>!</em> debugging tool Visible Stepping.</li>
						<li>Use and nest loops to control the sequence of commands.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Using Visible Stepping: Students explore and discuss Snap<em>!</em>'s Visible Stepping tool and try it out with their own Snap<em>!</em> song project. (5-10 minutes)</li>
						<li>Looping Your Song: Students use the <code>repeat</code> and <code>forever</code> blocks to loop one or more pieces of their song and even explore nesting one <code>repeat</code> block inside another like the example provided on the activity page. (5-10 minutes)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>When learning the <code>forever</code> block, there is always a chance that some student will struggle to stop the loop. As the text on the student activity page describes, they can either click the red stop sign (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="red stop button" title="red stop button"/>) to stop all scripts or click the script that is running to stop it.</li>

					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Use a conditional together with a predicate to test whether the user's answer is correct.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students read about the reporter versions of the <code>if</code> and <code>ask</code> blocks and then learn about the command versions of these blocks. They create a script to play a mystery song, accept a guess from the user, and confirm whether the user's guess is correct. (10-20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Optionally, students can add additional <code>if else</code> blocks to offer users credit for alternative spellings. This is a good differentiation task for students moving through the material more quickly. (5-10 minutes, if used)</li>
						<li>Optionally, students can take on a more challenging exercise: randomly choosing which mystery song to play. This is minimal guidance provided for this exercise, and it is suggested for a more intrepid programmer. (10-20 minutes, if used)</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>

				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students first read a detailed passage describing code for mapping over a table of song data. (5-10 minutes)</li>
						<li>They then reread and discuss the passage with a partner (5-10 minutes) before building their own version and using it to create a more complex song with the same musical sequence repeated a different pitches. (5-10 minutes)</li>
						<li>Optionally, students who may be skeptical that this complex process is necessary are invited to investigate their own approach, and students are invited to try adjusting the beats instead of only the pitches in their song. (5-30 minutes)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>After students complete the activity page, consider doing one or more of the following:

				<li><strong>2-AP-11: Create clearly named variables that represent different data types and perform operations on their values.</strong> A variable is like a container with a name, in which the contents may change, but the name (identifier) does not. When planning and developing programs, students should decide when and how to declare and name new variables. Students should use naming conventions to improve program readability. Examples of operations include adding points to the score, combining user input with words to make a sentence, changing the size of a picture, or adding a name to a list of people. </li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-12: Design and iteratively develop programs that combine control structures, including nested loops and compound conditionals.</strong> Control structures can be combined in many ways. Nested loops are loops placed within loops. Compound conditionals combine two or more conditions in a logical relationship (e.g., using AND, OR, and NOT), and nesting conditionals within one another allows the result of one conditional to lead to another. For example, when programming an interactive story, students could use a compound conditional within a loop to unlock a door only if a character has a key AND is touching the door. </li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-13: Decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs.</strong> Students should break down problems into subproblems, which can be further broken down to smaller parts. Decomposition facilitates aspects of program development by allowing students to focus on one piece at a time (e.g., getting input from the user, processing the data, and displaying the result to the user). Decomposition also enables different students to work on different parts at the same time. For example, animations can be decomposed into multiple scenes, which can be developed independently.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-14: Create procedures with parameters to organize code and make it easier to reuse.</strong> Students should create procedures and/or functions that are used multiple times within a program to repeat groups of instructions. These procedures can be generalized by defining parameters that create different outputs for a wide range of inputs. For example, a procedure to draw a circle involves many instructions, but all of them can be invoked with one instruction, such as “drawCircle.” By adding a radius parameter, the user can easily draw circles of different sizes.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-19: Document programs in order to make them easier to follow, test, and debug.</strong> Documentation allows creators and others to more easily use and understand a program. Students should provide documentation for end users that explains their artifacts and how they function. For example, students could provide a project overview and clear user instructions. They should also incorporate comments in their product and communicate their process using design documents, flowcharts, and presentations.</li>
