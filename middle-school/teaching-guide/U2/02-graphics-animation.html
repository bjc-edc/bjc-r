		<h2>Lab 2: Graphics and Animation</h2>
		<p>After exploring song writing as an introduction to sequencing and looping commands, students explore the graphical aspects of  Snap<em>!</em> programing, including sprite movement and costumes as well as events such as clicking a sprite or a specific area on the  Snap<em>!</em>. stage. The goal is for students to create a fun and/or useful object of their own design such as an animated greeting card to share with others or an interactive poster for a presentation topic in another class.</p>
		<p>As the teacher, you may opt to focus on some activities in this lab more than others.</p>

					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>You may wish to review the contents of this lab&mdash;particularly the list of "New Snap<em>!</em> Skills" on this page&mdash;and decide ahead of time whether your class will cover (and hence should design a project plan for) each of the new skills. Each skill listed on this activity page aligns with a single later activity in this lab.</li>
						<li>Prepare to share the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mlbSvkS0-Q79WgHw7k0IaWsKEpLvMNHLs98VobeM438/copy" title="Activity 1: Planning Your Interactive Project worksheet" target="_blank">Planning Your Interactive Project</a> worksheet with students (e.g., print it, add it to your learning management system, etc.). If you plan to cover only a subset of the activities in this lab, you may wish to modify the worksheet before posting.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Understand the new skills they will learn in this lab.</li>
						<li>Plan an interactive project that uses each of these new skills.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>New Snap<em>!</em> Skills: Students learn about the kinds of animation-related features they will be learning to use in their project. (5&ndash;10 min)</li>
						<li>Making Your Plan: Students decide on the purpose of the interactive project they will create and decide how they will use each of the new skills they will develop of the course of this lab. (15&ndash;30 min)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>You might choose to review one or more of the example interactive projects together and to discuss how they use each of the new Snap<em>!</em> skills students will be learning.</li>
						<li>Students do not need to stick to their design plan perfectly. As they develop their project in Snap<em>!</em>, their design may change; this is normal for any creative endeavor. The purpose of creating a plan is so that they design a project with some overall coherence rather than one with a bunch of random features.</li>
						<li>Look out for any students having trouble understanding the new features they will be learning about. It's not possible to design for a feature you don't understand. Discuss these upcoming skills as needed.</li>

		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-AP-12: Design and iteratively develop programs that combine control structures, including nested loops and compound conditionals.</strong> Control structures can be combined in many ways. Nested loops are loops placed within loops. Compound conditionals combine two or more conditions in a logical relationship (e.g., using AND, OR, and NOT), and nesting conditionals within one another allows the result of one conditional to lead to another. For example, when programming an interactive story, students could use a compound conditional within a loop to unlock a door only if a character has a key AND is touching the door.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-13: Decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs.</strong> Students should break down problems into subproblems, which can be further broken down to smaller parts. Decomposition facilitates aspects of program development by allowing students to focus on one piece at a time (e.g., getting input from the user, processing the data, and displaying the result to the user). Decomposition also enables different students to work on different parts at the same time. For example, animations can be decomposed into multiple scenes, which can be developed independently.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-14: Create procedures with parameters to organize code and make it easier to reuse.</strong> Students should create procedures and/or functions that are used multiple times within a program to repeat groups of instructions. These procedures can be generalized by defining parameters that create different outputs for a wide range of inputs. For example, a procedure to draw a circle involves many instructions, but all of them can be invoked with one instruction, such as “drawCircle.” By adding a radius parameter, the user can easily draw circles of different sizes.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-15: Seek and incorporate feedback from team members and users to refine a solution that meets user needs.</strong> Development teams that employ user-centered design create solutions (e.g., programs and devices) that can have a large societal impact, such as an app that allows people with speech difficulties to translate hard-to-understand pronunciation into understandable language. Students should begin to seek diverse perspectives throughout the design process to improve their computational artifacts. Considerations of the end-user may include usability, accessibility, age-appropriate content, respectful language, user perspective, pronoun use, color contrast, and ease of use. </li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-19: Document programs in order to make them easier to follow, test, and debug.</strong> Documentation allows creators and others to more easily use and understand a program. Students should provide documentation for end users that explains their artifacts and how they function. For example, students could provide a project overview and clear user instructions. They should also incorporate comments in their product and communicate their process using design documents, flowcharts, and presentations.</li>
