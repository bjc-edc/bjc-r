				Still needed:
				<ul>
					<li>Initial offline activity needs cleanup</li>
					<li>Mary to include this video (WHERE?): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvyTEx1wyOY" title="code.org video: Computer Science is Changing Everything" target="_blank">code.org video: Computer Science is Changing Everything</a> and introduce functions</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>This lab serves as introduction to course. After a quick video from the curriculum developers, the class shares their experience and interest in computer science and then explores a simple offline activity designed to introduce the basics of how computers process data in functional programming<!--takes turns pretending to be a computer and following drawing instructions precisely-->. Students then create Snap<em>!</em> accounts and learn about the Snap<em>!</em> programming language, interface, and terminology (reporter blocks, input parameters) by using various blocks that greet the user in different ways and changing the input parameters to explore the impact on outputs.</p>
		<p>In this course, the curriculum will provide students with starter projects for them to save to their accounts. It's also possible to create new projects, and students may wish to explore that on their own time.</p>

					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Assure students that all levels of computing experience are welcome in this class. You are asking these questions so that you and the curriculum developers can tailor the class to the experience and interests of students.</li>
						<li>If some students are hesitant to share their computing experience or there isn't enough time to hear from everyone, consider making it a brief (1 paragraph) writing assignment.</li>
						<li>Make note of the types of responses students provide in the getting-to-know-you discussion so that you can share them with curriculum developers.</li>
						<li>Allowing students to develop their own classroom norms gives them a sense of agency over classroom expectations. Use the suggested questions (or other probing questions) to help students consider how to create a classroom environment that maximizes learning and minimizes distraction and barriers to learning.</li>

							<p>This is a re-imagining of the <a href="https://csunplugged.org/" target="_blank">CS Unplugged</a> activity called <a href="https://classic.csunplugged.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/unplugged-12-programming_languages.pdf" target="_blank">"Marching Orders"</a> done as a <em>functional-programming</em> activity.</p>
							<p>As you can see, the key is that the person doing the drawing tries to mess up as much as possible <em>while still following the directions specified</em>. For example, if the programmer (the student creating the instructions) says to draw a square, the computer (the student drawing) could draw a very tiny square if the programmer didn't specify how big it should be.</p>
						</div>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Appreciate that you need precision to be able to describe something to a computer.</li>
						<li>Appreciate that functions take inputs, process them in various ways, and produce an output.</li>

							Then as a class...
							<ol>
								<li>Ask students to come up with another picture using the same geometric primitives. Collect and shuffle them, and pass them out again. </li>
								<li>Explain that the picture that they drew could also be thought of as coming from a function, like 2*(3+7). We’d show how that expression can be seen another way, as smaller one-task machines cascading into each other. I sometimes called the lower part of the picture below "funnel functions" because they look like funnels and return only one thing at the bottom and they are functions.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students may be inclined to write instructions that a computer couldn't follow (unless it were programmed to) such as "draw a smiley face." Make sure students only write instructions using the list of commands provided.</li>
						<li>This activity has been done for years as the <a href="https://youtu.be/Ct-lOOUqmyY" title="Josh Darnit's Peanut Butter and Jelly video" target="_blank">Peanut Butter and Jelly</a> activity in which the teacher asks the students to describe how to make a PB&amp;J sandwich <em>as precisely</em> as possible. As you saw in the <a href="https://youtu.be/fjF2ALrdd5A" title="Josh Darnit's Exact Instructions Challenge video" target="_blank">Exact Instructions Challenge</a>, the key to the whole activity is that the "computer" is supposed to try to find ways to mess up.</li>
						<li>Don't dwell on the fact that the instructions are mostly command-based.<div class="todo">Dan, I'm hoping you'll say more here about commands vs. functions or maybe just delete this line if I wrote it (and then delete this comment). Thanks! --MF, 8/18/21</div></li>

				</li>				
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Before leading the activity with students, create your own Snap<em>!</em> account (if you haven't already) and customize your own settings.</li>
						<li>You may find it helpful to review the beginning of the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/snap-crash-course.html?course=bjc4nyc_teacher.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Beauty and Joy of Computing: Snap! Crash Course">Beauty and Joy of Computing: Snap<em>!</em> Crash Course</a> and perhaps also to familiarize yourself with the structure of the <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/help/SnapManual.pdf" title="Snap! Reference Manual">Snap<em>!</em> Reference Manual</a>, which is accessible by clicking the Snap<em>!</em> logo in the top left corner of any Snap<em>!</em> window.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Create a Snap<em>!</em> account.</li>
						<li>Learn to navigate the Snap<em>!</em> interface.</li>
						<li>Customize the Snap<em>!</em> programming environment.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
						<li>Students create a Snap account.</li>
						<li>Students then customize several basic Snap<em>!</em> settings (language and appearance).</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>During the signup process, new users are asked to click a link in their email to verify the account, but that doesn't have to happen right away.</li>
						<li>Snap<em>!</em> users can change their password at any time using the Cloud menu.</li>
						<li>
							Users can tell whether they are logged in by checking the Snap<em>!</em> Cloud menu:
							<ul>
								<li>If it says "Logout" and then a user name, then that user is logged in.</li>
								<li>If it says "Login..." then no one is logged in.</li>
							</ul>
							If students are using shared computers, they should log out of Snap<em>!</em> when they are done.
						</li>
						<li>Make note of any questions or difficulties that arise, and please share them with the curriculum developers.</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Take a few minutes to explore the blocks in the Snap<em>!</em> project so you understand what they do before you share the Google doc with students.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Understand that a block is a piece of code that can be run by a computer and it can be run by clicking it.</li>
						<li>Understand that reporter blocks are blocks that report outputs.</li>
						<li>Understand that block can have inputs, those inputs can change the output, and the output of one block can be used as the input to another.</li>
						<li>Explore changing inputs by typing different text into the input slots, by selecting different dropdown menu options, and by dragging other blocks into the input slots. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students explore two blocks:
							<ul>
							    <li><img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/say-hello.png" alt="say hello to () in ('English')" title="say hello to () in ('English')" />, which takes a name and a language as input and reports a greeting to that person in the selected language.</li>
								<li><img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/fancy.png" alt="fancy ()" title="fancy ()" />, which takes text as input and reports the same text with any letters changed to fancy Unicode letters</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Students then nest the <code>fancy</code> block inside the <code>say hello</code> block and observe how the input of <code>fancy</code> becomes the input to <code>say hello</code>.</li>
						<li>Finally, students learn to save their project to the Snap<em>!</em> cloud, as they should every day and periodically while working.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>In this first hands-on exploration with Snap<em>!</em>, students may struggle with basics such as clicking a block to make it run, difficulty typing into input slots etc. The simplicity of this project allows for debugging these simple challenges of the absolute beginner so that they are resolved by the time students move on to more complex use of the Snap<em>!</em> interface such as dragging blocks into each other, creating input parameters, and creating and editing blocks.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Standards:</strong>

		<!--<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-DA-07: Represent data using multiple encoding schemes.</strong> Data representations occur at multiple levels of abstraction, from the physical storage of bits to the arrangement of information into organized formats (e.g., tables). Students should represent the same data in multiple ways. For example, students could represent the same color using binary, RGB values, hex codes (low-level representations), as well as forms understandable by people, including words, symbols, and digital displays of the color (high-level representations).</li>
				<li><strong>2-DA-08: Collect data using computational tools and transform the data to make it more useful and reliable.</strong> As students continue to build on their ability to organize and present data visually to support a claim, they will need to understand when and how to transform data for this purpose. Students should transform data to remove errors, highlight or expose relationships, and/or make it easier for computers to process. The cleaning of data is an important transformation for ensuring consistent format and reducing noise and errors (e.g., removing irrelevant responses in a survey). An example of a transformation that highlights a relationship is representing males and females as percentages of a whole instead of as individual counts.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-14: Create procedures with parameters to organize code and make it easier to reuse.</strong>   Students should create procedures and/or functions that are used multiple times within a program to repeat groups of instructions. These procedures can be generalized by defining parameters that create different outputs for a wide range of inputs. For example, a procedure to draw a circle involves many instructions, but all of them can be invoked with one instruction, such as “drawCircle.” By adding a radius parameter, the user can easily draw circles of different sizes.</li>
				<li><strong>3A-AP-21:</strong> Evaluate and refine computational artifacts to make them more usable and accessible.</li>
