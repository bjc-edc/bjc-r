			<p>Status:</p>
			<p>
				Still needed:
				<ul>
					<li>Dan's video from us (thanks for being a pilot!)</li>
					<li>Initial offline activity: marching orders? functional? baking a cake?</li>
					<li>Reviewing
						<ul>
							<li>Has this version captured the original vision of the lab? Have we missed anything?</li>
							<li>Any additions/changes to the contents of this page?</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Mary to include this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvyTEx1wyOY" title="code.org video: Computer Science is Changing Everything" target="_blank">code.org video: Computer Science is Changing Everything</a> and introduce functions</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>This lab serves as introduction to course. After a quick video from the curriculum developers, the class shares their experience and interest in computer science and then explores a simple offline activity designed to introduce the basics of how computers process data in functional programming<!--takes turns pretending to be a computer and following drawing instructions precisely-->. Students then create Snap<em>!</em> accounts and learn about the Snap<em>!</em> programming language, interface, and terminology (reporter blocks, input parameters) by using various blocks that greet the user in different ways and changing the input parameters to explore the impact on outputs.</p>
		<p>In this course, the curriculum will provide students with starter projects for them to save to their accounts. It's also possible to create new projects, and students may wish to explore that on their own time.</p>

						<li>Understand the goals of the course.</li>
						<li>Understand the growth mindset.</li>
						<li>Establish classroom norms.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
						<li>After welcoming students to the class and addressing any administrative matters, share the <a href="" title="BJC Culture and Norms video" target="_blank">BJC Culture and Norms video</a>.</li>
						<li>
							Lead a brief getting-to-know-you discussion by asking:
							<ul>
								<li>What is your computing experience?</li>
								<li>What do you want out of this course?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Guide students in collaboratively developing a list of classroom norms by asking questions like:
							<ul>
								<li>What makes it easier for you to learn?</li>
								<li>What gets in the way of your learning?</li>
								<li>What classroom norms could we create to facilitate your learning?</li>

					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="comment">We might want to include a feedback form for teachers to tell us what they learn about student programming experience and hopes for the class. --MF</div>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Assure students that all levels of computing experience are welcome in this class. You are asking these questions so that you and the curriculum developers can tailor the class to the experience and interests of students.</li>
						<li>Make note of the types of responses students provide in the getting-to-know-you discussion so that you can share them with curriculum developers.</li>
						<li>Allowing students to develop their own classroom norms gives them a sense of agency over classroom expectations. Use the suggested questions (or other probing questions) to help students consider how to create a classroom environment that maximizes learning and minimizes distraction and barriers to learning.</li>

		<h3>Activity 2: Draw Like a Computer.<a name="A2" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>Awaiting a revision from Dan. We didn't do the Marching Orders because it was command/sequential focused, but the "translate a recipe to a flowchart" approach missed some of the goals of the activity. --MF, 7/9/21</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Materials:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Each student will need several pieces of paper and a writing implement.</li>
						<li><a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U1/L1/02-draw-like-a-computer.html" title="Draw Like a Computer" target="_blank">Draw Like a Computer</a> student-facing instructions</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>You may wish to do the first section of the activity <!--()--> as a class...</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Appreciating that you need precision to be able to describe something to a computer.</li>
						<li>Appreciating that functions take inputs, process them in various ways, and produce and output.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
						<li>Demonstrate the activity by reading aloud a list of commands and asking students to pretend to be computers and to follow the commands precisely.</li>
						<li>Students then create their own drawing and write computer instructions for re-creating.</li>
						<li>In pairs, students take turns reading their list of commands while the other pretends to be a computer and follows the instructions precisely.</li>
						
						<li>to ask the students to come up with the picture that is supposed to be copied themselves, using only simple straight lines up down left right or 45° diagonal, circles, and arcs. Basically simple geometric sketches, nothing squiggly or anything. Those could all be collected and then reshuffled around the room in the standard marching orders way. </li>
						<li>explain that the picture that they drew could also be thought of as coming from a function, like 2*(3+7). We’d show how that expression can be seen another way, as smaller one-task machines cascading into each other. I sometimes called the lower part of the picture below “funnel functions” because they look like funnels and return only one thing at the bottom and they are functions.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students may be inclined to write instructions that a computer couldn't follow (unless it were programmed to) such as draw a smiley face. Make sure students only write instructions using the list of commands provided.</li>
						<li>Not dwelling on the fact that it’s mostly command-based.</li>
					</ul>

				</li>				
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Before leading the activity with students, create your own Snap<em>!</em> account (if you haven't already) and customize your own settings.</li>
						<li>You may find it helpful to review the beginning of the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/snap-crash-course.html?course=bjc4nyc_teacher.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Beauty and Joy of Computing: Snap! Crash Course">Beauty and Joy of Computing: Snap<em>!</em> Crash Course</a> and perhaps also to familiarize yourself with the structure of the <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/help/SnapManual.pdf" title="Snap! Reference Manual">Snap<em>!</em> Reference Manual</a>, which is accessible by clicking the Snap<em>!</em> logo in the top left corner of any Snap<em>!</em> window.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Create a Snap<em>!</em> account.</li>
						<li>Learn to navigate the Snap<em>!</em> interface.</li>
						<li>Customize the Snap<em>!</em> programming environment.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
						<li>Students create a Snap account.</li>
						<li>Students then customize several basic Snap<em>!</em> settings (language and appearance).</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>During the signup process, new users are asked to click a link in their email to verify the account, but that doesn't have to happen right away.</li>
						<li>Snap<em>!</em> users can change their password at any time using the Cloud menu.</li>
						<li>
							Users can tell whether they are logged in by checking the Snap<em>!</em> Cloud menu:
							<ul>
								<li>If it says "Logout" and then a user name, then that user is logged in.</li>
								<li>If it says "Login..." then no one is logged in.</li>
							</ul>
							If students are using shared computers, they should log out of Snap<em>!</em> when they are done.
						</li>
						<li>Make note of any questions or difficulties that arise, and please share them with the curriculum developers.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Standards:</strong>

		<div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Materials</strong>&mdash;Google doc coming soon!</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Take a few minutes to explore the blocks in the Snap<em>!</em> project so you understand what they do before you share the Google doc with students.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Learn about reporter blocks in Snap<em>!</em>, which are procedures that report an output.</li>
						<li>Learn to use input arguments and that they may change the resulting output of a reporter.</li>
						<!--<li>Learn that blocks can take different kinds of input such as text or numbers.</li>-->
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students explore several simple blocks that take one or more inputs(s) and observe the reported results.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>In this first hands-on exploration with Snap<em>!</em>, students may struggle with basics such as clicking a block to make it run, difficulty typing into input slots etc. The simplicity of this project allows for debugging these simple challenges of the absolute beginner so that they are resolved by the time students move on to more complex use of the Snap<em>!</em> interface such as dragging blocks into each other, creating input parameters, and creating and editing blocks.</li>

		<!--<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-DA-07: Represent data using multiple encoding schemes.</strong> Data representations occur at multiple levels of abstraction, from the physical storage of bits to the arrangement of information into organized formats (e.g., tables). Students should represent the same data in multiple ways. For example, students could represent the same color using binary, RGB values, hex codes (low-level representations), as well as forms understandable by people, including words, symbols, and digital displays of the color (high-level representations).</li>
				<li><strong>2-DA-08: Collect data using computational tools and transform the data to make it more useful and reliable.</strong> As students continue to build on their ability to organize and present data visually to support a claim, they will need to understand when and how to transform data for this purpose. Students should transform data to remove errors, highlight or expose relationships, and/or make it easier for computers to process. The cleaning of data is an important transformation for ensuring consistent format and reducing noise and errors (e.g., removing irrelevant responses in a survey). An example of a transformation that highlights a relationship is representing males and females as percentages of a whole instead of as individual counts.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-14: Create procedures with parameters to organize code and make it easier to reuse.</strong>   Students should create procedures and/or functions that are used multiple times within a program to repeat groups of instructions. These procedures can be generalized by defining parameters that create different outputs for a wide range of inputs. For example, a procedure to draw a circle involves many instructions, but all of them can be invoked with one instruction, such as “drawCircle.” By adding a radius parameter, the user can easily draw circles of different sizes.</li>
				<li><strong>3A-AP-21:</strong> Evaluate and refine computational artifacts to make them more usable and accessible.</li>
