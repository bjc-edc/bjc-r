		<h2>Lab 7: Dealing with Data Dos</h2>
		<p>This lab culminates students' introduction to functional programming with a data processing project using higher order functions and two-dimensional lists. Students design a survey on a topic of their choosing to investigate the relationship(s) between two or more variables. They then review <code>item of</code> and the higher order function <code>map</code> and learn about <code>ask</code> and <code>add</code> as they create cools to collect data from other students, friends, or family. After collecting data, they review arithmetic operators and <code>if then else</code> and learn about <code>all but first</code>, <code>length of list</code>, and the higher order functions <code>keep</code> and <code>combine</code> as they create various list processing tools to analyze their data and answer their research question.</p>
		<div class="endnote">As a reminder, <strong>functional programming</strong> is a programming paradigm in which computation is achieved by <strong>composing</strong> <strong>functions</strong> (<em>reporter</em> and <em>predicate</em> blocks) <strong>together</strong> rather than <strong>sequencing</strong> (i.e., re-ordering) <em>command</em> blocks. Instead of using  <strong>iteration</strong> to process lists, it uses <strong>higher order functions</strong>, which are functions that takes a function <em>itself</em>  as input. Functional programming also treats data as <strong>immutable</strong>, so data cannot be changed once it is created. For example, lists cannot be modified with the <code>add</code>, <code>insert</code>, and <code>delete</code> command blocks. We believe this is the first time  a Middle School blocks-based programming  course  has taught functional programming <em>first</em>, and we seek to understand what works (i.e., engages, inspires, etc.) and what doesn't (i.e., confuses, frustrates, etc.).</div>

		<h3>Daily Activity: Computing in the News.<a name="DA" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<p>Every day of BJC should begin with a 5-minute student presentation on a recent news article about computing. This helps build a foundation for considering the impacts of  computing technologies on employment, issues of bias and accessibility, and tradeoffs between public access to information and security. Read <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" title="Computing in the News" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> for additional details and suggested news sources.</p>

		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-DA-08: Collect data using computational tools and transform the data to make it more useful and reliable.</strong> As students continue to build on their ability to organize and present data visually to support a claim, they will need to understand when and how to transform data for this purpose. Students should transform data to remove errors, highlight or expose relationships, and/or make it easier for computers to process. The cleaning of data is an important transformation for ensuring consistent format and reducing noise and errors (e.g., removing irrelevant responses in a survey). An example of a transformation that highlights a relationship is representing males and females as percentages of a whole instead of as individual counts.</li>
				<!--<li><strong>2-AP-14:</strong> Students should create procedures and/or functions that are used multiple times within a program to repeat groups of instructions. These procedures can be generalized by defining parameters that create different outputs for a wide range of inputs. For example, a procedure to draw a circle involves many instructions, but all of them can be invoked with one instruction, such as “drawCircle.” By adding a radius parameter, the user can easily draw circles of different sizes.</li>-->
