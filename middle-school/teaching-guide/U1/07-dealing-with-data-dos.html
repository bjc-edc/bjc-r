		<h2>Lab 7: Dealing with Data Dos</h2>
		<p>This lab culminates students' introduction to functional programming with a data processing project using higher order functions and two-dimensional lists. Students design a survey on a topic of their choosing to investigate the relationship(s) between two or more variables. They then review <code>item of</code> and the higher order function <code>map</code> and learn about <code>ask</code> and <code>add</code> as they create cools to collect data from other students, friends, or family. After collecting data, they review arithmetic operators and <code>if then else</code> and learn about <code>all but first</code>, <code>length of list</code>, and the higher order functions <code>keep</code> and <code>combine</code> as they create various list processing tools to analyize their data and answer their research question.</p>
		<div class="endnote">As a reminder, <strong>functional programming</strong> is a modality that focuses on the input and output of functions rather than sequencing (ordering commands one after another) and iteration (repetition); a <strong>higher order function</strong> is a function that takes a function itself (rather than the output of a function) as input (or one that reports a function as output). The research goal of this curriculum is to investigate the feasibility of teaching functional programming <em>first</em> in an introductory programming course.</div>

		<h3>Daily Activity: Computing in the News.<a name="DA" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<p>Every day of BJC should begin with a 5-minute student presentation on a recent news article about computing. This helps build a foundation for considering the impacts of  computing technologies on employment, issues of bias and accessibility, and tradeoffs between public access to information and security. Read <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" title="Computing in the News" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> for additional details and suggested news sources.</p>
