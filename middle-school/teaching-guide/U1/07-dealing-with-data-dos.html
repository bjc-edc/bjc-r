		<h2>Lab 7: Dealing with Data Dos</h2>
		<p>This lab culminates students' introduction to functional programming with a data processing project using higher-order functions and two-dimensional lists. Students design a survey on a topic of their choosing to investigate the relationship(s) between two or more variables. They then review <code>item of</code> and the higher-order function <code>map</code> and learn about <code>ask</code> and <code>add</code> as they create tools to collect data from other students, friends, or family. After collecting data, they review arithmetic operators and <code>if then else</code> and learn about <code>all but first</code>, <code>length of list</code>, and the higher-order functions <code>keep</code> and <code>combine</code> as they create various list processing tools to analyze their data and answer their research question.</p>
		<div class="endnote">As a reminder, <strong>functional programming</strong> is a programming paradigm in which computation is achieved by composing functions (<em>reporter</em> and <em>predicate</em> blocks) together rather than sequencing (i.e., ordering) <em>command</em> blocks. Instead of using  iteration to process lists, it uses <strong>higher-order functions</strong>, which are functions that takes a function <em>itself</em>  as input. Functional programming also treats data as immutable, so data cannot be changed once it is created. For example after their initial creation, lists cannot be modified with the <code>add</code>, <code>insert</code>, and <code>delete</code> command blocks.
		</div>
		<p>This unit endeavors to prioritize functional programming as much as possible. This final lab uses <em>imperative</em> programming (uses commands to change the program's state) for gathering the data before switching to a strictly <em>functional</em> approach for data processing. We believe this is the first time a Middle School blocks-based programming course has taught functional programming <em>first</em>, and we seek to understand what works (i.e., engages, inspires, etc.) and what doesn't (i.e., confuses, frustrates, etc.).</p>

		<h3>Daily Activity: Computing in the News.<a name="DA" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<p>Every day of BJC should begin with a 5-minute student presentation on a recent news article about computing. This helps build a foundation for considering the impacts of  computing technologies on employment, issues of bias and accessibility, and tradeoffs between public access to information and security. Read <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" title="Computing in the News" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> for additional details and suggested news sources.</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Assign to one student or a pair of students a recent news article about computing for them to read and then summarize for the class during the next class period.</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Review the student page so that you understand the constraints on the student-selected research plans that will work well with this lab. Research questions should investigate the relationship between two (or more) variables. And data processing strategies should rely on actual Snap<em>!</em> capabilities (described in the student page). Students should be encouraged to go beyond the options they are presented with, but these minimum constraints are designed to ensure that students are in a position to create a successful data processing project with this lab design.</li>
						<li>Consider whether it will help your students to use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uSDU7iI4oeaHnTRF7UtynKDbq6dgsOCuWbz0i-kO5M4/edit#" title="Activity 1: Planning Your Survey worksheet" target="_blank">Planning Your Survey worksheet</a>, and if so, prepare to share it with your class.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Develop a research question to investigate the relationship between two (or more) variables.</li>
						<li>Design one one survey question to collect data about each variable.</li>
						<li>Create a data processing strategy to investigate the research question.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Designing a Research Plan: Students briefly review the overall structure of their Lab 3 project (a survey with one question investigating one variable), create a research question to investigate the two (or more) variables, and develop corresponding survey questions. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Designing a Data Processing Strategy: Students briefly consider the capabilities of Snap<em>!</em> that may be relevant to processing the data they collect, develop a rough plan for data collection (primarily to help ensure that their research question will yield a feasible project, and discuss their plan with a classmate. (15&ndash;30 minutes)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>You may prefer to discuss the constraints on students' research plans and co through the examples as a group before students begin working on the activity page to create plans of their own.</li>
						<li>You may also opt to pause to discuss the capabilities of Snap<em>!</em> before students rough out their data processing strategy</li>
						<li>You may wish to review students' research plans to check that they their plan will work well as a Snap<em>!</em> project with this lab.</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Before class, decide on the logistics for data collection. You may wish to have students leave their code open and rotate seats around the room or in small groups answering each other's questions. Or you may wish to have students remain in their seats, verbally collect data and enter it into their own surveys. In an online format, students may collect data in break-out rooms, or they may collect data from family and friends. You may wish to set a target number of people to collect data from based on the number of students and classroom dynamics.</li>

					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Learn how to access a subset of values from a table.</li>

				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Asking the User a Question: Students review the structure of their table (a list of lists with only one list so far: their survey questions), learn how the <code>questions only</code> and <code>ask</code> blocks work, and discuss how to use these tools  to populate their table of data. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Adding New Responses to Your Table: Students use the <code>map</code> block to create a <code>new response</code> block that takes survey data as input, asks the user each question in the survey, and reports a list of the user's responses. They then use the <code>add</code> block to append a user response to the end of the <var>my survey</var> list, and test their code by adding a few responses to the survey. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Collecting Data: Students remove their test data from the survey and then collect the actual data they will process to answer their research question. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>

<div class="todo">
					Should we have them look at the watcher in <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/2-quizzes.html?topic=nyc_bjc/2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">list view</a> so they can see what the structure behind the table is? It seems hard to explain and doesn't always perform as expected...
					<p>"Snap<em>!</em> has two different views for data in tables. You can switch which view you see by right-clicking (or control-clicking) on the <var>my survey</var> watcher on the stage."</p>
                                    Eh, its pretty finicky to use, took me a while to even get my mouse in the right spot to get the option, and then even harder to switch back. I think the table view still looks like a 2D list to me, though the pretend lettering of A/B/C (versus 1/2/3) feels a little trying-to-hard-to-be-a-spreadsheet. But I still think I'd vote for just sticking to table view. Could mention in TG? -PF 11/27

		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-DA-08: Collect data using computational tools and transform the data to make it more useful and reliable.</strong> As students continue to build on their ability to organize and present data visually to support a claim, they will need to understand when and how to transform data for this purpose. Students should transform data to remove errors, highlight or expose relationships, and/or make it easier for computers to process. The cleaning of data is an important transformation for ensuring consistent format and reducing noise and errors (e.g., removing irrelevant responses in a survey). An example of a transformation that highlights a relationship is representing males and females as percentages of a whole instead of as individual counts.</li>
				<!--<li><strong>2-AP-14:</strong> Students should create procedures and/or functions that are used multiple times within a program to repeat groups of instructions. These procedures can be generalized by defining parameters that create different outputs for a wide range of inputs. For example, a procedure to draw a circle involves many instructions, but all of them can be invoked with one instruction, such as “drawCircle.” By adding a radius parameter, the user can easily draw circles of different sizes.</li>-->
				<!---<li><strong>2-AP-17: Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases.</strong>  Use cases and test cases are created and analyzed to better meet the needs of users and to evaluate whether programs function as intended. At this level, testing should become a deliberate process that is more iterative, systematic, and proactive than at lower levels. Students should begin to test programs by considering potential errors, such as what will happen if a user enters invalid input (e.g., negative numbers and 0 instead of positive numbers). </li>-->
