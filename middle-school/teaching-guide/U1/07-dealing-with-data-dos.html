		<h2>Lab 7: Dealing with Data Dos</h2>
		<p>This lab culminates students' introduction to functional programming with a data processing project using higher-order functions and two-dimensional lists. Students design a survey with multiple questions on a topic of their choosing. They then review <code>item of</code> and the higher-order function <code>map</code> and learn about <code>ask</code> and <code>add</code> as they create tools to collect data from other students, friends, or family. After collecting data, they review arithmetic operators and <code>if then else</code> and learn about <code>all but first</code>, <code>length of list</code>, and the higher-order functions <code>keep</code> and <code>combine</code> as they create various list processing tools to analyze their data and investigate their research topic.</p>
		<div class="endnote">As a reminder, <strong>functional programming</strong> is a programming paradigm in which computation is achieved by composing functions (<em>reporter</em> and <em>predicate</em> blocks) together rather than sequencing (i.e., ordering) <em>command</em> blocks. Instead of using  iteration to process lists, it uses <strong>higher-order functions</strong>, which are functions that takes a function <em>itself</em>  as input. Functional programming also treats data as immutable, so data cannot be changed once it is created. For example after their initial creation, lists cannot be modified with the <code>add</code>, <code>insert</code>, and <code>delete</code> command blocks.
		</div>
		<p>This unit endeavors to prioritize functional programming as much as possible. This final lab uses <em>imperative</em> programming (uses commands to change the program's state) for gathering the data before switching to a strictly <em>functional</em> approach for data processing. We believe this is the first time a Middle School blocks-based programming course has taught functional programming <em>first</em>, and we seek to understand what works (i.e., engages, inspires, etc.) and what doesn't (i.e., confuses, frustrates, etc.).</p>

		<h3>Daily Activity: Computing in the News.<a name="DA" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<p>Every day of BJC should begin with a 5-minute student presentation on a recent news article about computing. This helps build a foundation for considering the impacts of  computing technologies on employment, issues of bias and accessibility, and tradeoffs between public access to information and security. Read <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" title="Computing in the News" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> for additional details and suggested news sources.</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Assign to one student or a pair of students a recent news article about computing for them to read and then summarize for the class during the next class period.</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Review the student page so that you understand the constraints on the student-selected research plans that will work well with this lab. Investigation topics should be complex enough to support two or more survey questions, and data processing strategies should rely on actual Snap<em>!</em> capabilities (described in the student page). Students should be encouraged to go beyond the options they are presented with, but these minimum constraints are designed to ensure that students are in a position to create a successful data processing project with this lab design.</li>
						<li>Consider whether it will help your students to use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uSDU7iI4oeaHnTRF7UtynKDbq6dgsOCuWbz0i-kO5M4/copy" title="Activity 1: Planning Your Survey worksheet" target="_blank">Planning Your Survey</a> worksheet, and if so, prepare to share it with your class.</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Designing a Research Plan: Students choose an investigation topic, and design a survey with two or more  questions to research it. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Designing a Data Processing Strategy: Students briefly consider the capabilities of Snap<em>!</em> that may be relevant to processing the data they collect, develop a rough plan for data collection (primarily to help ensure that their topic of investigation will yield a feasible project, and discuss their plan with a classmate. (15&ndash;30 minutes)</li>
					</ul>

				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Before class, decide on the logistics for data collection. You may wish to have students leave their code open and rotate seats around the room or in small groups answering each other's questions. Or you may wish to have students remain in their seats, verbally collect data and enter it into their own surveys. In an online format, students may collect data in break-out rooms, or they may collect data from family and friends. You may wish to set a target number of people to collect data from based on the number of students and classroom dynamics.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Learn how to access a subset of values from a table.</li>
						<li>Learn how to ask the user a question.</li>
						<li>Review the higher-order function <code>map</code>, and use it to create a new survey response.</li>
						<li>Learn how to add data to a table.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Asking the User a Question: Students review the structure of their table (a list of lists with only one list so far: their survey questions), learn how the <code>questions only</code> and <code>ask</code> blocks work, and discuss how to use these tools  to populate their table of data. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Adding New Responses to Your Table: Students use the <code>map</code> block to create a <code>new response</code> block that takes survey data as input, asks the user each question in the survey, and reports a list of the user's responses. They then use the <code>add</code> block to append a user response to the end of the <var>my survey</var> list, and test their code by adding a few responses to the survey. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Collecting Data: Students remove their test data from the survey and then collect the actual data they will process to investigate their topic. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							You may wish to pause to review the <code>map</code> block, which they learned about in <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U1/L4/04-pixel-mapper.html?topic=middle-school%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 4 Activity 4: Transforming Every Pixel">Lab 4 Activity 4: Transforming Every Pixel</a>, and/or to discuss how to use it to create the code for the <code>new response</code> block.<br />

<div class="todo">
					Should we have them look at the watcher in <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/2-quizzes.html?topic=nyc_bjc/2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">list view</a> so they can see what the structure behind the table is? It seems hard to explain and doesn't always perform as expected...
					<p>"Snap<em>!</em> has two different views for data in tables. You can switch which view you see by right-clicking (or control-clicking) on the <var>my survey</var> watcher on the stage."</p>
                                    Eh, its pretty finicky to use, took me a while to even get my mouse in the right spot to get the option, and then even harder to switch back. I think the table view still looks like a 2D list to me, though the pretend lettering of A/B/C (versus 1/2/3) feels a little trying-to-hard-to-be-a-spreadsheet. But I still think I'd vote for just sticking to table view. Could mention in TG? -PF 11/27

					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>You may wish to review the process of exporting and importing blocks before your students work on this activity page.</li>
						<li>Depending on time and student interest, consider whether you want some, none, or all of your students to import their data visualization blocks from their prior data project and use them to process this data.</li>
						<li>Decide how you want students to respond to the reflection questions at the end (out loud to a partner, in the Google doc, on paper, etc.)</li>
						<li>Consider whether you'd like to end the lab with students sharing their work, and if so, how you'd like to structure it. Sharing could be in the form of quick small-group shares or more formal presentations to the class. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Identify questions that can be answered using Snap<em>!</em> tools.</li>
						<li>(Optionally) Import blocks from another project.</li>
						<li>(Optionally) Use data visualization tools to create a pictograph of data.</li>
						<li>Reflect on the research process.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Asking Additional Questions: Students create and answer additional questions about their data. (5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>
						<li>Importing Blocks from Another Project: Students export blocks from their "Visualizing Data" project, import them into this project, and use them to create a pictograph of their data. (Optional: 10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Reflecting on Your Results: Students consider what they have learned, who might benefit from the information, what else they could ask, what else they could build in Snap<em>!</em> to support research, and what other topics they'd like to research? (5&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Sharing: Allow time for students to share their investigation topic, survey questions, data, the way they processed their data, what they learned about their data, any visualizations they created, and their reflections. (20&ndash;90 minutes)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Note that the <code>sort data</code> block requires <em>counted</em> data as input (that is, data that has gone through the <code>count data</code> block).</li>

		<h3>Feedback</h3>
		<p>Your feedback is critical to the success of this pilot. Please let us know how each lab went. For this lab, you might provide feedback such as:
			<ul>
				<li>How engaged were your students in the data processing theme of this lab?</li>
				<li>How well did your students understand the two higher-order functions presented in this unit (<code>keep</code> and <code>combine</code>)? How well did the remember the higher-order function <code>map</code> that they'd learned previously in Unit 1 Lab 4 Activity 4?</li>
				<li>Were any of these higher-order functions easier or harder for your students to learn about and use? Do you have any suggestions for improvements to our presentation of these functions?</li>
				<li>There are more activities in Lab 7 than in previous labs, and each are shorter than those for other labs. Do you have a preference for either format?</li>
				<li>Have you still been doing computing in the news with your students? If not, why not? If so, how is it going?</li>
				<li>How well do you feel like you understand the functional programming approach? (Could you explain it to a colleague?)</li>
				<li>Do you have any recommendations for functional programming projects that you think your students would enjoy?</li>

		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-DA-08: Collect data using computational tools and transform the data to make it more useful and reliable.</strong> As students continue to build on their ability to organize and present data visually to support a claim, they will need to understand when and how to transform data for this purpose. Students should transform data to remove errors, highlight or expose relationships, and/or make it easier for computers to process. The cleaning of data is an important transformation for ensuring consistent format and reducing noise and errors (e.g., removing irrelevant responses in a survey). An example of a transformation that highlights a relationship is representing males and females as percentages of a whole instead of as individual counts.</li>
				<!--<li><strong>2-AP-14:</strong> Students should create procedures and/or functions that are used multiple times within a program to repeat groups of instructions. These procedures can be generalized by defining parameters that create different outputs for a wide range of inputs. For example, a procedure to draw a circle involves many instructions, but all of them can be invoked with one instruction, such as “drawCircle.” By adding a radius parameter, the user can easily draw circles of different sizes.</li>-->
				<!---<li><strong>2-AP-17: Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases.</strong>  Use cases and test cases are created and analyzed to better meet the needs of users and to evaluate whether programs function as intended. At this level, testing should become a deliberate process that is more iterative, systematic, and proactive than at lower levels. Students should begin to test programs by considering potential errors, such as what will happen if a user enters invalid input (e.g., negative numbers and 0 instead of positive numbers). </li>-->
