        <h2>Lab 3: Dealing with Data</h2>
		<p>After their first introduction to Snap<em>!</em> and functional programming, students begin to use <em>lists</em> to store cleaned qualitative data. Students begin with offline tasks: defining a research question, collecting data from classmates, and clean the data. They then input the cleaned data into Snap<em>!</em>, create a pictograph visualization, and communicate their results to the class. In this lab, students extend their understanding about lists from merely editing existing lists as they did in the previous lab to creating a list of their own.</p>

					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Decide how you will have students collect their data. (A couple of options are in the "Tips" section below.)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Practice defining a research question and collecting data.</li>
						<li>Learn how to clean data.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students begin by deciding on a survey-like question to research. Examples are provided in the student materials.</li>
						<li>Students collect their data on paper with the Data Collection Worksheet or on the computer by using a Google Form.</li>
						<li>Students clean their data so it can be processed by a computer.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>If you have time, you might help students create a Google Form to collect their data so that respondents can answer anonymously and the data will be organized neatly.</li>
						<li>The data cleaning process requires decision making. Students may have to decide, for example, whether to count "electric guitar" and "acoustic guitar" as the same category ("guitar") or as two separate categories. Some of that decision making process may depend on the number of responses or on the knowledge of the student-researcher about the topic (in this example, their knowledge of guitars).</li>
						<li>As students are cleaning data collected from other students, you may wish to point out that the data cleaning process isn't necessarily about correcting mistakes (although it can include that); it's about resolving the natural variation in responses to open-ended questions.</li>
					</ul>

					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Before moving on to this activity, verify that each student has a cleaned list of responses to their research question.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Use lists to store data.</li>
						<li>Process data using various operations.</li>
						<li>Create a pictograph visualization.</li>
						<li>Communicate research results.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students enter their cleaned data into Snap<em>!</em> as a list.</li>
						<li>Students use Snap<em>!</em> to process the data into a list counting the number of similar responses.</li>
						<li>Students create a pictograph of their data and describe the results.</li>
						<li>Students share their results with the class or in small groups.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>In Snap<em>!</em>, if you shift-click on the arrows at the end of the <code>list</code> block, you can add or remove <em>three</em> input slots at a time instead of just one.</li>
						<li>If your students cleaned their data in spreadsheet software, they can export/save the data as a CSV file and drag it into Snap<em>!</em> window to import the data.</li>
						<li>You may find <a href="https://emojifinder.com/" title="Emoji Finder" target="_blank">Emoji Finder</a> helpful for finding a good emoji. After copying it, you can use your computer's standard keyboard shortcut to paste it into Snap<em>!</em>.</li>
						<li>Variables are not introduced yet intentionally&mdash;as part of the functional-programming research goal&mdash;so that students are able to focus on functions and data.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-DA-08: Collect data using computational tools and transform the data to make it more useful and reliable.</strong> As students continue to build on their ability to organize and present data visually to support a claim, they will need to understand when and how to transform data for this purpose. Students should transform data to remove errors, highlight or expose relationships, and/or make it easier for computers to process. The cleaning of data is an important transformation for ensuring consistent format and reducing noise and errors (e.g., removing irrelevant responses in a survey). An example of a transformation that highlights a relationship is representing males and females as percentages of a whole instead of as individual counts.</li>
