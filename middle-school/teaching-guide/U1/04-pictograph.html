        <h2>Lab 4: Data Analysis/ Making a Pictograph</h2>
		<p>This lab collect data from your classmates, analyze the data, and create a pictograph visualization of the results.</p>
        
        <h3>Pacing</h3>
		<p>This lab is designed for X&ndash;X class periods (<strong>X&ndash;X minutes</strong>).</p>

		<h3>Learning Goals:</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Work through the process of collecting and analyzing data: 
					<ul>
						<li>Defining a question</li>
						<li>Collecting, clearing, and analyzing data</li>
						<li>Visualizing and sharing findings</li>
					</ul>
				</li>	
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Lesson Plan:</h3>
		<p>
			<div class="comment">This timeline looks optimistic to me. Based on our experiences with teachers on BJC CSP I would expect this to take 2-3 class periods as written. --MF, 6/15/21</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Defining the question (5 minutes): Students begin by deciding on a survey-like question to research. Examples are provided in the student materials.</li>
				<li>Collecting the Data (15 minutes): Students collect their data on paper with an included worksheet.</li>
				<li>Cleaning the Data (5 minutes): Students organize their data so it can be processed by a computer.</li>
				<li>Analyzing the Data (10 minutes): Students use Snap<em>!</em> to process the data into a list counting the number of similar responses.</li>
				<li>Visualizing the Data (10 minutes): Students create a pictograph of their data using emojis.</li>
				<li>Show &amp; Tell (5 minutes): Students share their results with the class or in small groups.</li>
			</ul>

		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-DA-08:</strong> Collect data using computational tools and transform the data to make it more useful and reliable. As students continue to build on their ability to organize and present data visually to support a claim, they will need to understand when and how to transform data for this purpose. Students should transform data to remove errors, highlight or expose relationships, and/or make it easier for computers to process. The cleaning of data is an important transformation for ensuring consistent format and reducing noise and errors (e.g., removing irrelevant responses in a survey). An example of a transformation that highlights a relationship is representing males and females as percentages of a whole instead of as individual counts.</li>
