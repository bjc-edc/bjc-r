		<h2>Lab 6: Texting Tricks</h2>
		<p>At this point, students have learned a variety of functional programming techniques. In Lab 1, they nested blocks to use the output of one block as the input to another. In Lab 2, they used lists to store a selection of possible words, used <code>join</code> to add an "s" to the end of a word, and created new blocks that accept inputs. In Lab 4, they learned how images are stored as a list of lists (a list of pixels each containing a list of color values), and they used the higher order function <code>map</code> to select a single color value from every pixel in a list. In Lab 5, they nested a more complex series of blocks to encode and decode messages.</p>
		<p>Here in Lab 6, students extend their growing facility with functional programming to create and analyze code with nested functions. They learn several new blocks: the relatively simple <code>split</code> block, which students use to divide a text string into a list of letters; the <code>if then else</code> block, which they use to make decisions based on a predicate (testing function); and the higher order function <code>find first</code>, which identifies the first list item that passes a predicate test.</p>
		<p><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/emojify-i-love-rain-reporting.png" alt="emojify ('I love rain) reporting 'I ❤️ ☔️ '" title="emojify ('I love rain) reporting 'I ❤️ ☔️ '" />These more advanced concepts are developed in the playful context of embellishing text with emojis and alternate spellings used in texting and on the Internet, and the lab culminates with a non-programming opportunity to consider issues of bias in the range of emojis available and with students designing an emoji of their own.</p>

		<h3>Daily Activity: Computing in the News.<a name="DA" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<p>Every day of BJC should begin with a 5-minute student presentation on a recent news article about computing. This helps build a foundation for considering the impacts of  computing technologies on employment, issues of bias and accessibility, and tradeoffs between public access to information and security. Read <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" title="Computing in the News" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> for additional details and suggested news sources.</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Prepare:</strong>  Assign to one student or a pair of students a recent news article about computing for them to read and then summarize for the class during the next class period.</li>

					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>There is a good deal of reading on this page, you may wish to walk through that content together as a class.</li>
						<li>If you are not familiar with using the <code>if</code> reporter, you may want to review that section of the student page.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Use a conditional (<code>if then else</code>) together with a predicate to control which letters are <code>map</code>ped to numbers.</li>
						<li>Practice creating blocks with inputs.</li>
						<li>Practice with the <code>split</code>, <code>map</code>, and <code>join</code> blocks.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>What is L33t? Students learn about leet, a modified spelling system created in the 1980s, and what it will take to build a block that converts text into leet. Consider whether reading this as a class or in small groups might be more effective for your students than reading individually would be. (5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>
						<li>Creating a Letter-Changing Function. Students use the reporter form of the <code>if</code> conditional together with a predicate to create a function that takes one letter as input and if the letter the target for their change (such as "e"), then it reports the replacement character (such as "3"), and otherwise reports the input letter. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li><code>Map</code>ping the Letter-Changing Function Over All the Letters. Students use their <code>change letter</code> block together with <code>split</code>, <code>map</code>, and <code>join</code> to create a block that takes a word or phrase as input and reports the same word or phrase with all instances of one letter replaced by a number. This section includes several optional extension activities. (10&ndash;40 minutes)</li>
						<li>Post-activity Show &amp; Tell. You may wish to have students share the their <code>l33t</code> blocks, any project extensions they completed, and any ideas for project extensions they have. (Optional: 10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

Project extensions:
	You can change emojify to generate random emojis by changing:

<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/item-2-of-word-emoji-pair.png" alt="" title="" />

to:
	<img class="" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab06/item-random-of-all-but-first-of-word-emoji-pair.png" alt="" title="" />

Then you can add additional emojis to each list, and it will pick randomly from them.

							<ul>
								<li>The <code>emojify</code> block is a reporter block, so it uses a <code>report</code> block to send back a computed value to the main program.</li>
								<li>The <code>report</code> block has a nested <code>join</code> block. A <code>join</code> block joins together multiple strings of text into one long string of text.</li>
								<li>The <code>join</code> block has a nested <code>map</code> block. A <code>map</code> block performs the same operation on every item in a list and reports a new list containing those results. The first input is the operation, the second input is the list.</li>
								<li>The first input to the <code>map</code> block is another <code>join</code> block that joins the result of calling the <code>emojify word</code> block with a space character.</li>
								<li>The second input to <code>map</code> is the <code>split</code> block that splits the input text into a bunch of words.</li>

					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>This activity is optional, review it and decide whether you will use it with your students.</li>
						<li>If you opt to use this unit, read through the student page and the links with optional reading first. Be sure you understand how the <code>emojify</code>, <code>emojify word</code>, <code>emoji from pair</code>, and <code>find first</code> blocks work before leading this activity with students.</li>
						<li>Consider how you plan to run this activity. You could have students work through the page in pairs or small groups discussing as they go. You could work through the whole page together as a class. Or you would have them work in pairs or groups and then bring the class together periodically for discussions to make sure they understand each block before moving on.</li>
					</ul>

				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Analyze a set of three nested functions: <code>emojify</code>, <code>emojify word</code>, and <code>emoji from pair</code>.</li>
						<li>Understand how the <code>find first</code> higher order function works both on a list and on a list of lists.</li>
						<li>Review the use of the <code>if then else</code> block.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>

		<h3>Correlation with CSTA Standards<a name="Standards" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-AP-13: Decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs.</strong> Students should break down problems into subproblems, which can be further broken down to smaller parts. Decomposition facilitates aspects of program development by allowing students to focus on one piece at a time (e.g., getting input from the user, processing the data, and displaying the result to the user). Decomposition also enables different students to work on different parts at the same time. For example, animations can be decomposed into multiple scenes, which can be developed independently.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-19: Document programs in order to make them easier to follow, test, and debug.</strong> Documentation allows creators and others to more easily use and understand a program. Students should provide documentation for end users that explains their artifacts and how they function. For example, students could provide a project overview and clear user instructions. They should also incorporate comments in their product and communicate their process using design documents, flowcharts, and presentations.</li>
				<li><strong>2-IC-21: Discuss issues of bias and accessibility in the design of existing technologies.</strong> Students should test and discuss the usability of various technology tools (e.g., apps, games, and devices) with the teacher's guidance. For example, facial recognition software that works better for lighter skin tones was likely developed with a homogeneous testing group and could be improved by sampling a more diverse population. When discussing accessibility, students may notice that allowing a user to change font sizes and colors will not only make an interface usable for people with low vision but also benefits users in various situations, such as in bright daylight or a dark room.</li>
