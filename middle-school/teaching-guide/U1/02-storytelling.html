        <h2>Lab 2: Super Short Stories <a name="top" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h2>

		<p>
			This lab builds student understanding of reporter functions and their inputs. In the introductory story-building activity, students change the inputs to a <code>super short story</code> block (procedure) that takes multiple inputs, use random word generator blocks as inputs to the <code>super short story</code> block, and edit the code behind the random word generator blocks. <br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/super-short-story-with-inputs-reporting.png" alt="Super Short Story, feeling: (random feeling) job: (random job) action: (random action) place: (random place) action: (random action) number: (pick random from (1) to (10)) color: (random color) plural animal: (plural of (random animal)) food: (random food)" title="Super Short Story, feeling: (random feeling) job: (random job) action: (random action) place: (random place) action: (random action) number: (pick random from (1) to (10)) color: (random color) plural animal: (plural of (random animal)) food: (random food)" /><br />
			Editing the list of possible random words for the generator blocks serves as students' first introduction to block-editing, randomness, and lists. As the lab progresses, students use the operators <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-1-to-10-full-size.png" alt="pick random from (1) to (10)" title="pick random from (1) to (10)" /> and <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join()().png" alt="join () ()" title="join () ()" /> as inputs to <code>super short story</code> then create a simple <code>plural of</code> block to abstract away the <code>join</code> function, and finally edit the <code>super short story</code> itself to customize it with their own story structure and create their own random word generator blocks. Along the way, students learn about nesting functions, creating and editing functions, and input parameters and arguments, and they build facility with the Snap<em>!</em> interface.

		<h3>Daily Activity: Computing in the News.<a name="DA" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<p>Every day of BJC should begin with a 5- to 15-minute student presentation on a recent news article about computing. This helps build a foundation for considering the impacts of  computing technologies on employment, issues of bias and accessibility, and tradeoffs between public access to information and security. Read <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" title="Computing in the News" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> for additional details and suggested news sources.</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Assign to one student or a pair of students a recent news article about computing for them to read and then summarize for the class during the next class period.</li>
						<li>Prepare your own quick synopsis as an example for the first day of Computing in the News.</li>

						<li>You may wish to work through this activity before sharing it with students.</li>
						<li>If you have students with limited English language skills, you may wish to create a version of this Snap<em>!</em> project in their language. A little Google translate should go far; it might not be perfect, but it could go a long way in removing that potential barrier.</li>
						<li>
							If you intend to do the Optional Offline Pre-Activity (creating a super short story together), write one or more single-sentence stories; for each story, select several words to remove; and for each removed word in a story, make note of a category of words that could replace that word. For example, for the story from the student's starter Snap<em>!</em> project, "The happy teacher jumps through Central Park and races over 7 red cats eating stir fry," the following words could be replaced by any word from the following categories: 
							<div class="indent bordered-table two-col" style="width:600px;">
								<div class="header">word to replace</div>

					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Understand that a block is a piece of code that can be run by a computer.</li>
						<li>Understand that a block can be run by clicking it.</li>
						<li>Understand that reporter blocks are blocks that report outputs.</li>
						<li>Understand that block can have inputs and that the output of one block can be used as the input to another.</li>
						<li>Explore changing inputs by typing different text into the input slots and by dragging other blocks into the input slots. </li>
						<li>Observe how changing a reporter's inputs influences its output.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Optional Offline Pre-Activity (5&ndash;10 minutes): 
							<ul>
								<li>Tell students you have made up a super short story and you need their help to fill in some blanks.</li>
								<li>Ask them for one (or more, as needed) word from each of the categories of the words you removed from your original story, displaying their responses as you go.</li>
								<li>Read the resulting story (with their words in place of your removed words) out loud.</li>
								<li>Repeat this process at least once with the same story and perhaps also with a second story, stopping while students are still enjoying the process.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Exploring in Snap<em>!</em> (5&ndash;10 minutes):
							<ul>
								<li>
									Students explore a <code>super short story</code> block that generates a short story using its inputs. They change the inputs and observe the impact on the reported sentence.<br />
									<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/super-short-story-reporting.png" alt="Super Short Story block with a variety of inputs reporting a single-sentence story using those inputs" title="Super Short Story block with a variety of inputs reporting a single-sentence story using those inputs" />
								</li>
								<li>Students then explore several simple <code>random</code> blocks that report random words from various categories (action, place, color, food, etc.) and use these random word generators inside the <code>super short story</code> block.</li>
								<li>Students then edit some of the <code>random</code> blocks to customize the story further.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>This activity specifically avoids using parts of speech in order to keep reduce the English language prerequisites.</li>
						<li>This project allows for some creativity to unfold, and with that creativity comes the potential for problematic text being added to student projects. You may wish to review briefly the classroom norms your students have established and/or refer back to it if needed.</li>
						<li>The sentences generated by the <code>super short story</code> block might not always make sense, such as if the form of the action word (verb person or tense) does not match the story structure or if the input number does not match the count of the animal (e.g., "...races over 1 red cats..."). There will be optional opportunities for students to address these issues.</li>

					<li><strong>2-DA-07: Represent data using multiple encoding schemes.</strong> Data representations occur at multiple levels of abstraction, from the physical storage of bits to the arrangement of information into organized formats (e.g., tables). Students should represent the same data in multiple ways. For example, students could represent the same color using binary, RGB values, hex codes (low-level representations), as well as forms understandable by people, including words, symbols, and digital displays of the color (high-level representations).</li>
					<li><strong>2-DA-08: Collect data using computational tools and transform the data to make it more useful and reliable.</strong> As students continue to build on their ability to organize and present data visually to support a claim, they will need to understand when and how to transform data for this purpose. Students should transform data to remove errors, highlight or expose relationships, and/or make it easier for computers to process. The cleaning of data is an important transformation for ensuring consistent format and reducing noise and errors (e.g., removing irrelevant responses in a survey). An example of a transformation that highlights a relationship is representing males and females as percentages of a whole instead of as individual counts.</li>
					<li><strong>3A-AP-21:</strong> Evaluate and refine computational artifacts to make them more usable and accessible.</li>
				</div>
				<li><strong>2-AP-14: Create procedures with parameters to organize code and make it easier to reuse.</strong>   Students should create procedures and/or functions that are used multiple times within a program to repeat groups of instructions. These procedures can be generalized by defining parameters that create different outputs for a wide range of inputs. For example, a procedure to draw a circle involves many instructions, but all of them can be invoked with one instruction, such as “drawCircle.” By adding a radius parameter, the user can easily draw circles of different sizes.</li>
