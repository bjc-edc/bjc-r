        <h2>Lab 2: Super Short Stories <a name="top" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h2>

		<p>This lab builds student understanding of reporter functions and their inputs. In a simple story-building exercise, students change inputs to a block that takes multiple inputs, use random word generator blocks as inputs to the story-building block, edit the functionality behind the random word generator blocks, edit the story-building block itself to customize it with their own short story structure, and finally create their own random word generator blocks. Along the way, students learn about nesting functions, creating and editing functions, and input parameters and arguments, and they build facility with the Snap<em>!</em> interface. </p>

		<h3>Activity 1: Super-Short Stories.<a name="A1" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Materials:</strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m-H1nPmDZh1VQO6jPEippUMjVisEAi1EjrjXg7i_kn0/edit#" title="Activity 4: Super-Short Stories Google Doc" target="_blank">Super-Short Stories Google Doc</a></li>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>You may wish to work through this activity before sharing it with students.</li>
						<li>If you have students with limited English language skills, you may wish to create a version of this Snap<em>!</em> project in their language. A little Google translate should go far; it might not be perfect, but it could do a long way in removing that potential barrier.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Understand that a block is a piece of code that can be run by a computer and can be run by clicking it.</li>
						<li>Understand that reporter blocks are blocks that report outputs.</li>
						<li>Understand that block can have input parameters and that the output of one block can be used as the input to another.</li>
						<li>Explore changing input parameters by typing different text into the input slots and by dragging other blocks into the input slots. </li>
						<li>Observe how changing a reporter's inputs influences its output.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students explore a custom block that generates a short story using its input parameters. They change the input parameters and observe the impact on the reported sentence.<br />
						<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/super-short-story-reporting.png" alt="Super Short Story block with a variety of inputs reporting a single-sentence story using those inputs" title="Super Short Story block with a variety of inputs reporting a single-sentence story using those inputs" />
						</li>
						<li>Students then explore several simpler custom blocks that report random words of various types (action, place, color, food, etc.) and use these random word generators inside the story.</li>
						<li>Students then save this project to their Snap<em>!</em> account.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>This project allows for some creativity to unfold, and with that creativity comes the potential for problematic text being added to student projects. Rather than assume students will make questionable choices and begin with a lecture about it, you may wish to review briefly the classroom norms your students have established.</li>
						<li>The sentences generated by the <code>super short story</code> block might not always make sense, such as if the form of the action word (verb person or tense) does not match the story structure or if the input number does not match the cardinality of the animal (e.g., "...races over 1 red cats...").</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Standards:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>2-AP-14:</strong> Create procedures with parameters to organize code and make it easier to reuse.</li>

						<li>Students try out a <code>mad lib</code> block several times, changing the inputs and noting the impact on the output and then using blocks that generate random words of various types as the inputs (<code>random color</code>, <code>random animal</code>, <code>random place</code>, etc.).</li>
						<li>Students then edit the random word blocks to select from random words of the students' choosing.</li>
						<li>Finally, students edit the <code>mad lib</code> block itself, changing the nature of the story.</li>

		<h3>Correlation with CSTA Standards<a name="Standards" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-DA-07: Represent data using multiple encoding schemes.</strong> Data representations occur at multiple levels of abstraction, from the physical storage of bits to the arrangement of information into organized formats (e.g., tables). Students should represent the same data in multiple ways. For example, students could represent the same color using binary, RGB values, hex codes (low-level representations), as well as forms understandable by people, including words, symbols, and digital displays of the color (high-level representations).</li>
				<li><strong>2-DA-08: Collect data using computational tools and transform the data to make it more useful and reliable.</strong> As students continue to build on their ability to organize and present data visually to support a claim, they will need to understand when and how to transform data for this purpose. Students should transform data to remove errors, highlight or expose relationships, and/or make it easier for computers to process. The cleaning of data is an important transformation for ensuring consistent format and reducing noise and errors (e.g., removing irrelevant responses in a survey). An example of a transformation that highlights a relationship is representing males and females as percentages of a whole instead of as individual counts.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-14: Create procedures with parameters to organize code and make it easier to reuse.</strong>   Students should create procedures and/or functions that are used multiple times within a program to repeat groups of instructions. These procedures can be generalized by defining parameters that create different outputs for a wide range of inputs. For example, a procedure to draw a circle involves many instructions, but all of them can be invoked with one instruction, such as “drawCircle.” By adding a radius parameter, the user can easily draw circles of different sizes.</li>
				<li><strong>3A-AP-21:</strong> Evaluate and refine computational artifacts to make them more usable and accessible.</li>
