		<h2>Lab 5: Storing and Securing Data</h2>
		<p>Having learned that images are stored as lists of pixels, which are themselves lists, students now dig deeper to understand how computers store that data as bits. In activities 1-3, students explore mathematical functions in Snap<em>!</em>, learn about binary representation (and optionally also hexadecimal), and learn that computers use binary to store data in on/off electrical signals. In activities 4 and 5, students encode and decode messages and learn about substitution ciphers both offline and in Snap<em>!</em>.</p> 

		<h3>Pacing</h3>

		<h3>Daily Activity: Computing in the News.<a name="DA" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<p>Every day of BJC should begin with a 5-minute student presentation on a recent news article about computing. This helps build a foundation for considering the impacts of  computing technologies on employment, issues of bias and accessibility, and tradeoffs between public access to information and security. Read <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" title="Computing in the News" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> for additional details and suggested news sources.</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Prepare:</strong>  Assign to one student or a pair of students a recent news article about computing for them to read and then summarize for the class during the next class period.</li>

							If you have time after students answer the questions on the student activity page in their pairs, you may wish to discuss the various "Talk with Your Partner" questions as a class:
							<ul>
								<li>
									After the "Storing Numbers in Bits" section:
									<ul>
										<li>Can you find a number that's the same in decimal and binary?</li>
										<li>Can you get a result that's all 1s? Hint: Start by trying to get just one 1, then two 1s, etc.</li>
										<li>Can you get a result that's 11110000? You may need a calculator and/or a teacher to figure this one out.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									After the "Storing Bits as Electricity" section:
									<ul>
										<li>What numbers result in no capacitors charged at all?</li>
										<li>What numbers make all the capacitors light up with charge?</li>
										<li>What's a number that charges every capacitor but one?</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Be mindful not to say "binary number" or "decimal number." Binary and decimal are notations, and the instances of those notations are numerals, not numbers. It's the same number no matter how it's represented.</li>
<div class="comment">I think its fine that our content says numerals, as I read Brians explanation and other articles on it, but honestly, given so many places (even AP CSP) says numbers, I feel like the ship has sailed there, and it's not worth it to try to correct teachers and make them feel bad. (Similar to the functions/pure functions thing). But perhaps BJC wants to steer the ship back. You can delete my comment, just sharing my reaction. -PF 9/25/21</div>

								Can you find a number that's the same in decimal and binary?
								<ul>
									<li>0 and 1 are the only numbers that are the same.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Can you get a result that's all ones?
								<ul>
									<li>
										Every decimal that is one less than a power of 2 is all ones. For example:
										<ul>
											<li>1<sub>10</sub> = 1<sub>2</sub> = (2 - 1)<sub>10</sub></li>
											<li>3<sub>10</sub> = 11<sub>2</sub> = (4 - 1)<sub>10</sub></li>
											<li>7<sub>10</sub> = 111<sub>2</sub> = (8 - 1)<sub>10</sub></li>
											<li>etc.</li>
										</ul>
										That's because in binary, powers of 2 are always a one followed by a bunch of zeros, so the number just before is all ones. It's analogous to 9, 99, 999, etc. in decimal; the number that is all nines is always one less than the power of 10.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Can you get a result that's 11110000?
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>An easy way is to type "11110000 in decimal" in Google, and it will calculate it for you!</p>
										To manually calculate it, write out the powers of 2 under each bit in the number:
										<div class="indent bordered-table" style="width:500px; grid-template-columns: auto auto auto auto auto auto auto auto;">
											<div>1</div>
											<div>1</div>
											<div>1</div>
											<div>1</div>
											<div>0</div>
											<div>0</div>
											<div>0</div>
											<div>0</div>
											<div>128</div>
											<div>64</div>
											<div>32</div>
											<div>16</div>
											<div>8</div>
											<div>4</div>
											<div>2</div>
											<div>1</div>
										</div>
										Then add up the powers that have a 1 in that place: 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								What numbers result in no capacitors charged at all?
								<ul>
									<li>Only the number 0 results in no capacitors charged. Every other number would need at least one capacitor charged.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								What numbers make all the capacitors light up with charge?
								<ul>
									<li>This is the same as the question about making numbers with all ones from the previous section. Any decimal number that's one less than a power of 2 will result in a row of charged capacitors.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								What's a decimal numeral that charges every capacitor but one?
								<ul>
									<li>
										There are lots of numbers that can answer this question! Here are some early ones: 
										<div class="indent bordered-table two-col" style="width:200px; text-align:center;">
											<div class="header">Decimal</div>
												<div class="header">Binary</div>
											<div>2</div>
												<div>10</div>
											<div>5</div>
												<div>101</div>
											<div>6</div>
												<div>110</div>
										</div>
										There's not a pattern to all the answers, so students can play with different decimal values until they find ones with a matching capacitor pattern, or they can write out binary sequences with only one 0 and then work out the decimal equivalent.

Students then nest these blocks to encode/decode whole words and/or sentences at a time.  (5&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Generalizing the Process: In small groups or as a class, students discuss how encoding and decoding compare, how these processes varied for each person's message and shift value, and how to generalize the process.

				<li><strong>2-NI-06: Apply multiple methods of encryption to model the secure transmission of information.</strong> Encryption can be as simple as letter substitution or as complicated as modern methods used to secure networks and the Internet. Students should encode and decode messages using a variety of encryption methods, and they should understand the different levels of complexity used to hide or secure information. For example, students could secure messages using methods such as Caesar cyphers or steganography (i.e., hiding messages inside a picture or other data). They can also model more complicated methods, such as public key encryption, through unplugged activities.</li>
				<li><strong>2-DA-07: Represent data using multiple encoding schemes.</strong> Data representations occur at multiple levels of abstraction, from the physical storage of bits to the arrangement of information into organized formats (e.g., tables). Students should represent the same data in multiple ways. For example, students could represent the same color using binary, RGB values, hex codes (low-level representations), as well as forms understandable by people, including words, symbols, and digital displays of the color (high-level representations).</li>
