		<p>Every day of BJC should begin with a 5-minute student presentation on a recent news article about computing. This helps build a foundation for considering the impacts of  computing technologies on employment, issues of bias and accessibility, and tradeoffs between public access to information and security.

Solutions

Storing decimals as bits

Can you find a number that's the same in decimal and binary? 
0 and 1 are the only numbers that are the same.

Can you get a result that's all 1s? 

Every decimal that is one less than a power of 2 is all 1s.
1 = 1 (same as 2 - 1)
3 = 11 (same as 4 - 1)
7 = 111 (same as 8 - 1)
etc. 

That's because powers of 2 are always 1 followed by a bunch of zeros, so the number before is 111. It's analogous to 9, 99, 999 - the number that is all 9s is always one less than the power of 10.

Can you get a result that's 11110000?

The really easy way is to type "11110000 in decimal" in Google, and it will calculate it for you! 

However, this is how we'd manually calculate it.

First, write out the powers of 2 under each bit in the number:

1
1
1
1
0
0
0
0
128
64
32
16
8
4
2
1


Then add up the powers that have a 1 in the place.
128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240

Storing bits as electricity

What decimal numbers result in no capacitors charged at all?

Only the decimal number 0 results in no capacitors charged. Every other number would need at least one capacitor charged.

What decimal numbers make all the capacitors light up with charge?

This is the same as the question about making numbers with all 1s from the previous section. Any decimal number that's a power of 2 minus 1 will result in a row of charged capacitors.

What's a decimal number that charges every capacitor but one?

There are lots of numbers that can answer this question!
Some early ones: 

Decimal
Binary
2
10
5
101
6
110


There's not a pattern to all the answers, so students can play with different decimal values until they find ones with a matching capacitor pattern, or they can write our binary sequences with only one 0 and then work out the decimal equivalent.

		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-NI-06: Apply multiple methods of encryption to model the secure transmission of information.</strong> Encryption can be as simple as letter substitution or as complicated as modern methods used to secure networks and the Internet. Students should encode and decode messages using a variety of encryption methods, and they should understand the different levels of complexity used to hide or secure information. For example, students could secure messages using methods such as Caesar cyphers or steganography (i.e., hiding messages inside a picture or other data). They can also model more complicated methods, such as public key encryption, through unplugged activities.</li>
				<li><strong>2-DA-07: Represent data using multiple encoding schemes.</strong> Data representations occur at multiple levels of abstraction, from the physical storage of bits to the arrangement of information into organized formats (e.g., tables). Students should represent the same data in multiple ways. For example, students could represent the same color using binary, RGB values, hex codes (low-level representations), as well as forms understandable by people, including words, symbols, and digital displays of the color (high-level representations).</li>
