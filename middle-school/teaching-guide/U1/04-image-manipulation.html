		<h2>Lab 4: Image Manipulation</h2>
		<div class="todo">I'm a bit confused about what this lab and the activities are called. Pamela, could you please clarify, and I'll change throughout? Thanks! :) --MF, 8/13/21<br>
	I had a hard time on names too. I like "Picture of a Pixel". I like Pixel Manipulation too, except that the lab as a whole is called "Image Manipulation", so that feels too similar. We could call it "<strong>Pixel Mapper</strong>" to really put the emphasis on the map operation, but maybe we explicitly want to avoid it. Other ideas I had were "Picture Filters" "Photo Filters" "Pixel Magic" "RGB Transformations". Votes? -- PF, 8/16/21
</div>
		<p>This lab teaches about pixels&mdash;what they are, how they make up an image on the screen, and how manipulating their red, green, and blue values can change an image. Students begin by watching a few videos demonstrating that a screen is indeed made up of tiny squares of red, green, and blue. They then view an image made up of large pixels at low resolution and increase the resolution (while shrinking the pixels) to see the pixels disappear as the image becomes more visible. Students then learn about lists and tables as they explore the RGB values of pixels in an image, explore the higher order function <code>map</code> as they select a single color value from each pixel in an image, and explore several filters that apply a transformation to each pixel of an image. </p>

		<h3>Daily Activity: Computing in the News.<a name="DA" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<p>Every day of BJC should begin with a 5-minute student presentation on a recent news article about computing. This helps build a foundation for considering the impacts of  computing technologies on employment, issues of bias and accessibility, and tradeoffs between public access to information and security. Read <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" title="Computing in the News" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> for additional details and suggested news sources.</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Prepare:</strong>  Assign to one student or a pair of students a recent news article about computing for them to read and then summarize for the class during the next class period.</li>

					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Learn that images are made up of pixels.</li>
						<li>Learn that pixels are made up of varying levels of red, green, and blue elements.</li>
						<li>Learn that a "white" pixel is actually made up of red/green/blue at full brightness.</li>
						<li>Observe that images become more recognizable and detailed at higher resolutions.</li>
						<li>Observe that an image is made up of large blocks of solid color, it's easier to recognize at lower resolutions.</li> 
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students watch several videos demonstrating that screens are made up of pixels.</li>
						<li>The class then experiments in Snap<em>!</em> with photos at various resolutions. Show a mystery image at lowest resolution, gradually increase the resolution until students begin guessing the image, and keep track on a chalkboard of the resolution at which students successfully guess picture. Then repeat the process for another mystery image.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>There are two videos included in the student-facing activity. The first is quite short (about 20 seconds), but the second is longer (almost 12 minutes). It is not necessary to watch the entirety of the second video; the first three minutes will suffice.</li>
						<li>This activity was developed based on the <a href="https://youtu.be/6H8vK8Q5KeY?t=891" title="Snap<em>!</em>" target="_blank">Snap<em>!</em> 5 Data Science video</a> by Snap<em>!</em> designer, Jens MÃ¶nig.</li>

		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-DA-07: Represent data using multiple encoding schemes.</strong> Data representations occur at multiple levels of abstraction, from the physical storage of bits to the arrangement of information into organized formats (e.g., tables). Students should represent the same data in multiple ways. For example, students could represent the same color using binary, RGB values, hex codes (low-level representations), as well as forms understandable by people, including words, symbols, and digital displays of the color (high-level representations).</li>
