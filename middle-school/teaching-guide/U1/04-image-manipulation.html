		<h2>Lab 4: Image Manipulation</h2>
		<p>This lab teaches about pixels&mdash;what they are, how they make up an image on the screen, and how manipulating their red, green, and blue values can change an image. Students begin by watching a few videos demonstrating that a screen is indeed made up of tiny squares of red, green, and blue. They then view an image made up of large pixels at low resolution and increase the resolution (while shrinking the pixels) to see the pixels disappear as the image becomes more visible. Students then learn about lists and tables as they explore the RGB values of pixels in an image, explore the higher order function <code>map</code> as they select a single color value from each pixel in an image, and explore several filters that apply a transformation to each pixel of an image. </p>

						<li>We recommend projecting the Snap<em>!</em> project and doing the doing student-facing activity as a teacher-led demonstration.</li>
						<li>If you aren't familiar with additive and subtractive color mixing, you might appreciate this article included as optional reading for students at the end of the second activity: <a href="https://www.color-meanings.com/additive-subtractive-color-mixing/" title="What Is the Difference Between Additive and Subtractive Color Mixing?" target="_blank">What Is the Difference Between Additive and Subtractive Color Mixing?</a></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Learn that images are made up of pixels, which can be stored as lists of color values.</li>
						<li>Learn that pixels are made up of varying levels of red, green, and blue elements.</li>
						<li>Observe that images become more recognizable and detailed at higher resolutions.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students watch several videos demonstrating that screens are made up of pixels. (5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>
						<li>The class then experiments in Snap<em>!</em> with photos at various resolutions. Show a mystery image at lowest resolution, gradually increase the resolution until students begin guessing the image, and keep track on a chalkboard of the resolution at which students successfully guess picture. Then repeat the process for another mystery image. (5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>There are two videos included in the student-facing activity. The first is quite short (about 20 seconds), but the second is longer (almost 12 minutes). It is not necessary to watch the entirety of the second video; the first three minutes will suffice.</li>
						<li>This activity was inspired by the <a href="https://youtu.be/6H8vK8Q5KeY?t=891" title="Snap<em>!</em>" target="_blank">Snap<em>!</em> 5 Data Science video</a> by Snap<em>!</em> designer, Jens MÃ¶nig.</li>

					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Before teaching this lab, you may wish to review the optional reading at the end of the student-page: "Why do RGB colors mix differently than paint?"</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Learn that a white pixel is actually made up of red, green, and blue each at full brightness and that a black pixel is the same three colors each with no brightness.</li>
						<li>Experiment with creating colors by adjusting RGB values.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan (10&ndash;20 minutes):</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students explore RGB colors by using several Snap<em>!</em> blocks: 
							<ul>
							    <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab04/rgb-pixel.png" alt="RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255)" title="RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255)" />, which take three integers from 0 to 255 as input and reports a <em>list</em> of the those three color values.</li>
								<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/lab04/draw-pixel.png" alt="draw pixel 'list input slot'" title="draw pixel 'list input slot'" />, which takes a list of RGB values (such as the output of <code>RGB pixel</code>) as input and draws a pixel with those values on the stage.</li>
								<li>
									<code>paint color from pixel</code>, which takes two inputs, a list of RGB color values (such as the output of <code>RGB pixel</code>) and a resolution (selected from a dropdown menu), and paints on the stage a grid of pixels with those color values at that resolution. At higher resolutions, the pixels will disappear into a single RGB color.<br />
									<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/paint-color-from-pixel-rgb-pixel.png" alt="paint color from pixel (RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255))" title="paint color from pixel (RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255))" />

						<li>You may wish to teach this activity through the slide deck. Review them and decide. (Please note that the activity pages have been developed further since the slides were created.)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Explore various Snap<em>!</em> costumes.</li>
						<li>Learn that images are stored as tables (lists of lists).</li>
						<li>Use <code>item of</code> to select a single pixel from a list.</li>
						<li>Understand a chain of functional results by discussing how the output of one function serves as the input to another function.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students learn about Snap<em>!</em> costumes and zoom in on an image of their choosing to see the RGB values of each pixel. (5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>
						<li>Optionally, students may add their own image to the Snap<em>!</em> project. (5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>
						<li>Students see how the pixels in images are stored as rows in a table, select a specific pixel from an image, and discuss how the output of one function becomes the input to another function and what that results in. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Optionally, students may look at the code behind the <code>color from pixel</code> block. (&lt;1 minute)</li>
						<li>The class watches the <a href="" title="" target="_blank">Domain and Range</a>video. (5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>The "If There is Time" activity invites students to add their own images to the Snap<em>!</em> project either by taking a picture with a webcam or dragging an image file into the "Costumes" tab in Snap<em>!</em>. If your class (or any given student or group of students) has extra time, this can be a fun way to personalize the project and learn new Snap<em>!</em> features, but it's not necessary for understanding the learning goals of this page.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>If you aren't familiar and comfortable with the higher order function <code>map</code>, you may want to work through the activity on your own before supporting students through this activity.

				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>There are two sets of optional "If There is Time" activities on this page:
							<ul>
    							<li>The first invites students to take a look at the code behind the <code>color from pixel</code> block. This code uses predicates and reporters, which aren't introduced until Unit 2. It's not recommended to teach this content now, but, being a fairly readable block of code, is offered as a preview of what is to come.</li>
								<li>The second offers students two additional filters to explore. </li>

				<li><strong>2-DA-07: Represent data using multiple encoding schemes.</strong> Data representations occur at multiple levels of abstraction, from the physical storage of bits to the arrangement of information into organized formats (e.g., tables). Students should represent the same data in multiple ways. For example, students could represent the same color using binary, RGB values, hex codes (low-level representations), as well as forms understandable by people, including words, symbols, and digital displays of the color (high-level representations).</li>
