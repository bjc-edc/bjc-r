		<p>This lab serves as introduction to course. After a quick video from the curriculum developers, the class shares their experience and interest in computer science and then explores a simple offline activity designed to introduce the basics of how computers process data in functional programming<!--takes turns pretending to be a computer and following drawing instructions precisely-->. Students then create Snap<em>!</em> accounts and learn about the Snap<em>!</em> programming language, interface, and terminology (reporter blocks, input parameters) by using various blocks that greet the user in different ways and changing the input parameters to explore the impact on outputs.</p>
		<p>In this course, the curriculum will provide students with starter projects for them to save to their accounts. It's also possible to create new projects, and students may wish to explore that on their own time.</p>

					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Assure students that all levels of computing experience are welcome in this class. You are asking these questions so that you and the curriculum developers can tailor the class to the experience and interests of students.</li>
						<li>Make note of the types of responses students provide in the getting-to-know-you discussion so that you can share them with curriculum developers.</li>
						<li>Allowing students to develop their own classroom norms gives them a sense of agency over classroom expectations.

						<li>Snap<em>!</em> users can change their password at any time using the Cloud menu.</li>
						<li>
							Users can tell whether they are logged in by checking the Snap<em>!</em> Cloud menu:
							<ul>
								<li>If it says "Logout" and then a user name, then that user is logged in.</li>
								<li>If it says "Login..." then no one is logged in.</li>
							</ul>
							If students are using shared computers, they should log out of Snap<em>!</em> when they are done.

			<h3>Activity 3.5?</h3>

				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>You may wish to work through this activity before sharing it with students.</li>
						<li>If you have students with limited English language skills, you may wish to create a version of this Snap<em>!</em> project in their language. A little Google translate should go far; it might not be perfect, but it could do a long way in removing that potential barrier.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Understand that a block is a piece of code that can be run by a computer and can be run by clicking it.</li>
						<li>Understand that reporter blocks are blocks that report outputs.</li>
						<li>Understand that block can have input parameters and that the output of one block can be used as the input to another.</li>
						<li>Explore changing input parameters by typing different text into the input slots and by dragging other blocks into the input slots. </li>
						<li>Observe how changing a reporter's inputs influences its output.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students explore a custom block that generates a short story using its input parameters. They change the input parameters and observe the impact on the reported sentence.<br />
						<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U1/super-short-story-reporting.png" alt="Super Short Story block with a variety of inputs reporting a single-sentence story using those inputs" title="Super Short Story block with a variety of inputs reporting a single-sentence story using those inputs" />
						</li>
						<li>Students then explore several simpler custom blocks that report random words of various types (action, place, color, food, etc.) and use these random word generators inside the story.</li>
						<li>Students then save this project to their Snap<em>!</em> account.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>This project allows for some creativity to unfold, and with that creativity comes the potential for problematic text being added to student projects. Rather than assume students will make questionable choices and begin with a lecture about it, you may wish to review briefly the classroom norms your students have established.</li>
						<li>The sentences generated by the <code>super short story</code> block might not always make sense, such as if the form of the action word (verb person or tense) does not match the story structure or if the input number does not match the cardinality of the animal (e.g., "...races over 1 red cats...").</li>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-DA-07: Represent data using multiple encoding schemes.</strong> Data representations occur at multiple levels of abstraction, from the physical storage of bits to the arrangement of information into organized formats (e.g., tables). Students should represent the same data in multiple ways. For example, students could represent the same color using binary, RGB values, hex codes (low-level representations), as well as forms understandable by people, including words, symbols, and digital displays of the color (high-level representations).</li>
				<li><strong>2-DA-08: Collect data using computational tools and transform the data to make it more useful and reliable.</strong> As students continue to build on their ability to organize and present data visually to support a claim, they will need to understand when and how to transform data for this purpose. Students should transform data to remove errors, highlight or expose relationships, and/or make it easier for computers to process. The cleaning of data is an important transformation for ensuring consistent format and reducing noise and errors (e.g., removing irrelevant responses in a survey). An example of a transformation that highlights a relationship is representing males and females as percentages of a whole instead of as individual counts.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-14: Create procedures with parameters to organize code and make it easier to reuse.</strong>   Students should create procedures and/or functions that are used multiple times within a program to repeat groups of instructions. These procedures can be generalized by defining parameters that create different outputs for a wide range of inputs. For example, a procedure to draw a circle involves many instructions, but all of them can be invoked with one instruction, such as “drawCircle.” By adding a radius parameter, the user can easily draw circles of different sizes.</li>
				<li><strong>3A-AP-21:</strong> Evaluate and refine computational artifacts to make them more usable and accessible.</li>
