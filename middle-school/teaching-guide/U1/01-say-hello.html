        <h2>Lab 1: Say Hello to Snap<em>!</em></h2>
        <div class="todo">Here's a very rough draft of a TG! This lab currently only has one activity. Perhaps there are more to come? Maybe "Say Hello" is one activity within a larger lab and not the name of the lab? --MF, 6/15/21</div>
		<p>This lab serves as introduction to the Snap<em>!</em> programming language, interface, and terminology (reporter blocks, input parameters). Students use a variety of blocks that say hello to the user in different ways, changing the input parameters to explore the impact on outputs.</p>
        
        <h3>Pacing</h3>
		<p>This lab is designed for 1-2 class periods (<strong>45&ndash;90 minutes</strong>).</p>

		<h3>Learning Goals:</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a Snap<em>!</em> account.</li>
				<li>Learn to navigate the Snap<em>!</em> interface.</li>
				<li>Identify function inputs and outputs.</li>
				<li>Explore how changing the inputs of a function includes its output.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Tips:</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Before leading the activity with students, create a Snap<em>!</em> account (if you haven't already) and work through the student-facing materials. Make note of any questions that arise or difficulties that come up, and please plan to share them with the curriculum developers.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
