		<h2>Lab 1: Meet micro:bit</h2>
		<p>Students set up their micro:bit controller and begin using it with the MicroBlocks interface. MicroBlocks is similar enough to Snap<em>!</em>, that students should adapt quickly. In this lab, they create a simple animation using MicroBlocks' <code>display</code> block, which controls the micro:bit's LED array; MicroBlocks' <code>light level</code>, which reports the amount of light detected by a sensor; as well as loops, conditionals, and predicates.</p> 

		<h3>Pacing</h3>
		<p>
			This lab is designed for 1&ndash;2 class periods (<strong>25&ndash;70 minutes</strong>).

		<h3>Daily Activity: Computing in the News.<a name="DA" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<p>Every day of BJC should begin with a 5-minute student presentation on a recent news article about computing. This helps build a foundation for considering the impacts of  computing technologies on employment, issues of bias and accessibility, and tradeoffs between public access to information and security. Read <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" title="Computing in the News" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> for additional details and suggested news sources.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Assign to one student or a pair of students a recent news article about computing for them to read and then summarize for the class during the next class period.</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Work through the student activity page and connect your own micro:bit before leading this activity with students.</li>
						<li>MicroBlocks does not offer accounts and cloud storage for projects. Decide where you want students to save their MicroBlocks files. For example, you may have them save to a networked drive or download files and upload them to a folder on Google Drive.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Set up the micro:bit with MicroBlocks.</li>
						<li>Control the micro:bit controller using the MicroBlocks interface.</li>
						<li>Save a MicroBlocks project file to the local computer.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Collect Materials and Set Up Your micro:bit with MicroBlocks: Students connect their micro:bit to the computer. (about 5 minutes)</li>
						<li>Adding Blocks: Students add the "Basic Sensors.ubl" and "LED Display.ubl" libraries. (less than 5 minutes)</li>
						<li>Using the <code>Display</code> Block: Students explore the <code>display</code> block and use it to control the micro:bit. (about 5 minutes)</li>
						<li>Saving Your Project: Students save their MicroBlocks project locally. (less than 5 minutes)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>You may wish to have the micro:bits and USB cables set out for students before they arrive.</li>
						<li>If students struggle to get their micro:bits connected...
							<div class="comment">Any other suggestions, Deanna? --MF, 1/28/22</div>
							<ul>
								<li>Invite them to follow all of the setup instructions again.</li>
								<li>Ensure that their micro:bit controller is properly connected to their computer.</li>
								<li>Try a different USB cable.</li>
								<li>Try a different micro:bit with that computer and try a different computer with that micro:bit.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-NI-04: Model the role of protocols in transmitting data across networks and the Internet.</strong> Protocols are rules that define how messages between computers are sent. They determine how quickly and securely information is transmitted across networks and the Internet, as well as how to handle errors in transmission. Students should model how data is sent using protocols to choose the fastest path, to deal with missing information, and to deliver sensitive data securely. For example, students could devise a plan for resending lost information or for interpreting a picture that has missing pieces. The priority at this grade level is understanding the purpose of protocols and how they enable secure and errorless communication. Knowledge of the details of how specific protocols work is not expected.</li>
