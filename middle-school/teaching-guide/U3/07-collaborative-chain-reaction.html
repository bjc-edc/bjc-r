		<h2>Lab 7: Collaborative Chain Reaction</h2>
		<p>A chain reaction (or Rube Goldberg machine) is a series of causes and effects that often results in the accomplishment of a simple task. The sequence of events is often absurd or convoluted, but that is the beauty in creating one of these machines. In this lab, students will work together to create a chain reaction machine that blends micro:bit with analog materials. Students map out a plan, run tests on their segments, and perform collectively the chain reaction machine.</p>

		<h3>Daily Activity: Computing in the News.<a name="DA" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<p>Every day of BJC should begin with a 5-minute student presentation on a recent news article about computing. This helps build a foundation for considering the impacts of  computing technologies on employment, issues of bias and accessibility, and tradeoffs between public access to information and security. Read <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" title="Computing in the News" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> for additional details and suggested news sources.</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Assign to one student or a pair of students a recent news article about computing for them to read and then summarize for the class during the next class period.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Activity 1: Make a Plan.<a name="A1" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Materials:</strong> <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U3/L7/01-make-a-plan.html" title="Activity 1: Make a Plan" target="_blank">Make a Plan</a> student page</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Pick a place for students to build their chain reactions. This can take up quite a lot of room, so pick a space with ample room for building as well as additional materials.</li>
                        <li>Place chain reaction materials nearby so students have easy access to balls, ramps, and other building materials.</li>
                        <li>Set a date for the chain reaction finale to invite friends, family, and other students and teachers to join in the celebration.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Make a plan for a multi-step project with their partner.</li>
                        <li>Collaborate with neighboring teams on how segments will connect.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students see what materials are available to then before making a plan.</li>
                        <li>Pairs articulate what materials they will need for their segment, how they will utilize both micro:bits, and how their segment will connect with neighboring segments.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
                        <li>Tables are great building surfaces, and each pair of students can use one table for building. Place tables in a zig-zag (non-linear) formation to add more complex movements between segments.</li>
                        <li>If possible, keep student projects undisturbed for the duration of their building. If that isn't possible, consider having them build on pieces of cardboard that then can be moved at the end of class and stored safely.</li>
					</ul>
