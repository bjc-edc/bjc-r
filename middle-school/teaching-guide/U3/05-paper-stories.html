		<h2>Lab 5: Paper Stories</h2>
		<p>Students use the micro:bit I/O pins to wire up LEDs using copper tape. They first learn how to make a copper tape LED circuit without code. Then, they learn how to control the lights using <code>digital pin</code> blocks by making an LED blink and a custom paper craft project.</p>

		<h3>Daily Activity: Computing in the News.<a name="DA" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<p>Every day of BJC should begin with a 5-minute student presentation on a recent news article about computing. This helps build a foundation for considering the impacts of  computing technologies on employment, issues of bias and accessibility, and tradeoffs between public access to information and security. Read <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" title="Computing in the News" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> for additional details and suggested news sources.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Assign to one student or a pair of students a recent news article about computing for them to read and then summarize for the class during the next class period.</li>

		<h3>Activity 1: LED It Glow.<a name="A1" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Materials:</strong> <a href="/bjc-r/middle-school/student-pages/U3/L5/01-led-it-glow.html" title="Activity 1: LED It Glow" target="_blank">LED It Glow</a> student page</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Lay out materials for students to make simple copper tape circuits. Make sure that they are plentiful and not precious, as part of learning how to make a copper tape circuit is making mistakes.</li>
                        <li>Keep LEDs in a small container to keep them from dispersing widely.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Make a simple circuit using an LED, coin cell battery, and copper tape.</li>
                        <li>Practice manipulating copper tape and making electrical connections.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students gather the materials they need to make a copper tape circuit.</li>
                        <li>Students map out and make a circuit.</li>
                        <li>If time, students make circuits with more than one LED.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
                        <li>Copper tape can be finnicky. If possible, keep one continuous piece for each segment.</li>
                        <li>If two pieces need to be connected to one another, the top of the copper tape is slightly more conductive than the adhesive side so connecting two top pieces might make for a stronger connection.</li>
                        <li>If LED does not light up, try smoothing out the tape or checking the battery and LED direction. Also try a different LED. If looking to invest in tools, a multimeter and soldering iron can make troubleshooting easier.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Standards:</strong> None covered.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-CS-03: Systematically identify and fix problems with computing devices and their components.</strong> Since a computing device may interact with interconnected devices within a system, problems may not be due to the specific computing device itself but to devices connected to it. Just as pilots use checklists to troubleshoot problems with aircraft systems, students should use a similar, structured process to troubleshoot problems with computing systems and ensure that potential solutions are not overlooked. Examples of troubleshooting strategies include following a troubleshooting flow diagram, making changes to software to see if hardware will work, checking connections and settings, and swapping in working components. </li>
