h3: Purpose
	raw-html: <p><strong>Programming Focus:</strong> Complexity and Abstraction, Lists and Higher Order Functions</p>
		raw-html:<p>This unit continues the study of abstraction as the means to control complexity.  Lab 1 explores several examples of complexity in different contexts.  Labs 2 and 3 focus on two applications of lists, an <em>aggregate</em> data type for storing multiple items of any type, including numbers, strings, other lists, or even blocks and scripts. Just as functions can take numbers and strings as inputs, they can also take lists as input, or produce lists as output.  A list is an ordered, numbered sequence of items.  Similar data types in other programming languages may be called "arrays," "sequences," or "vectors."</p>
        <p><span class="imageRight"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/map-new.png" alt="map () over 'list input slot'" title="map () over 'list input slot'" /><br /><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="keep items () from 'list input slot'" title="keep items () from 'list input slot'" /><br /><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/combine-new.png" alt="combine 'list input slot' using ()" title="combine 'list input slot' using ()" /><br /><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/find-first.png" alt="find first item () in 'list input slot'" title="find first item () in 'list input slot'" /></span>Our approach to lists emphasizes the use of the <strong>higher-order functions</strong> <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>, which allow programmers to think about a list as a single value, rather than looping explicitly through the items in the list one at a time. These functions are called "higher order" because, along with other data, they take functions as inputs.  For example, often a programmer wants to compute some function of each item in a list.  Instead of writing separate procedures such as "take the first letter of each item," "add 3 to each item," etc., the <code>map</code> function generalizes the "... of each item" part, and takes another function as input to specify the "first letter of" or "add 3 to" part.</p>
		<p>One of several design features that distinguishes BJC from other CS Principles curricula is that we emphasize <em>functional</em> programming. One virtue of the higher order list functions is that they generate new lists to report, rather than mutate existing lists.  This is in contrast with the imperative, looping, mutation-based programming that is more common, but more error-prone, in dealing with sequential data. No attention (for now) needs to be placed on the idea of procedures as data; the Snap<em>!</em> visual representation of higher order functions makes the use of a function (rather than the value it reports) as input apparent at a glance. The gray ring that represents a procedure as data is already in the higher order function block, and the user of the higher order function doesn't have to do anything else to make the function itself, rather than a value it reports, be taken as the input.  Near the end of the course, students build these higher order functions for themselves.</p>
        raw-html:<p><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/for-each.png" alt="for each (item) in 'list input slot' {}" title="for each (item) in 'list input slot' {}" />In situations in which imperative programming is needed, we still use a higher order procedure, <code>for each item</code>, a C-shaped block that takes a list and a script to be run for each item in the list.  This avoids the need for index variables.</p>
		raw-html: <p>The problems students are expected to solve in this unit are harder than what they saw in the first two units.  It may be a good idea to tell students to expect that.  Nothing in the unit requires superhuman programming ability, but we expect that students will have to struggle to understand the ideas. Encourage them by letting them know that you think they are ready for the challenge.</p>

	raw-html: <p><strong>Social Implications Focus:</strong> Robots and AI; Computers and Work</p>
		raw-html: <p>Lab 4: Robots and Artificial Intelligence. Students are introduced to some ideas and issues in artificial intelligence and discuss the challenges and consequences of this technology.  As always, discourage "is this technology good or bad?" questions, and instead encourage "What's good about this technology?  What's bad about it?  How can we change the design of this technology or of its social context to make it better?"</p>
		raw-html: <p>Lab 5: Computers and Work.  There are two related but separate issues in this lab:  How do computers affect the conditions of work, and how do they affect the availability of jobs?  The first of these includes things like computer-based surveillance of workers, for example to ensure that they're meeting sales quotas.  On the other hand, some of the mindless parts of jobs have been taken over by computers, leaving the more interesting parts for the human workers.  The second issue, about automation and jobs, has a conventional answer that jobs are just shifted, not lost, but that seems not to be true, or at least the available jobs are part-time and low-paying.

h3: Big Ideas: CRD, AAP, IOC; and Computational Thinking Practices and Skills: 2.A, 3.A, 3.B, 3.C, 5.C, 5.E
        raw-html:<p>This unit opens with an unplugged lab page, in which students develop an algorithm for navigating a maze without using a programming language (Skill: <strong>2.A</strong>; Big Idea: <strong>AAP</strong>). Next, they use procedural abstraction to manage the complexity of drawing a fractal, a brick wall, and a tic-tac-toe board (Skills: <strong>3.B</strong>, <strong>3.C</strong>; Big Idea: <strong>AAP</strong>). In the second lab, students use nested abstract data types and list traversal to manage data inputted by a user and to output requested data and explain how using abstract data types helps manage complexity (Skills: <strong>3.A</strong>, <strong>3.C</strong>; Big Ideas: <strong>CRD</strong>, <strong>AAP</strong>). At the end of the unit, students consider the beneficial and harmful impacts of robots and AI, including the role of bias (Skills: <strong>5.C</strong>, <strong>5.E</strong>; Big Ideas: <strong>IOC</strong>). </p>
        
h3: Enduring Understandings: CRD-2, AAP-1, AAP-2, AAP-3, IOC-1
        raw-html:<p>In Lab 1: Dealing with Complexity, students extend their use of sequencing, selection, and iteration to create an algorithm without using a programming language; and they extend and formalize their use of procedural abstraction (<strong>AAP-2</strong>, <strong>AAP-3</strong>). In Lab 2: Contact List, students learn to receive and process user input to determine program output; and they extend their use of data abstraction to include nested abstract data types (<strong>CRD-2</strong>, <strong>AAP-1</strong>). In Lab 4: Robots and Artificial Intelligence, students deepen their study of the unintended consequences of computing to include developing technologies and the risks of built-in bias (<strong>IOC-1</strong>). Lab 5: Computers and Work, extends the story of the benefits and unintended consequences of new technologies to include changes to the workplace (<strong>IOC-1</strong>).</p>
