title: Unit 8: Recursive Functions

{

	raw-html:<p>After the Create Task, all of the CSP curriculum framework has been addressed. Units 6&ndash;8 contain additional material that’s important to computer science, but some or all of these units may be covered after the AP exam.</p>
    raw-html: <div class="todo">BRIAN: you agreed to review everything in L3 (the labs and the TG) and then make the solutions before I split it into 4 mini-labs (so that we are sure it should be split before we do it). Then you realized that this whole unit needs major attention. Good luck and please LMK how I can help. --MF, 5/23/20</div>

heading: Lab 1: Recursive Reporters
    raw-html: <div class="todo">Mary to fold page 2 into page 1 (with solution hinted) --MF, 6/17/20<p>"a reporter only gets to report once, so when you do recursive commands, you use a helper function"</p><p>What? No.  A reporter only gets to report once, so when you write a recursive reporter you have to use a <em>combiner</em> function to connect the recursive call(s) with the non-recursive steps. -bh</p></div>
