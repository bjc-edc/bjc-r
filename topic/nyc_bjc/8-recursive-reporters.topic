title: Unit 8: Recursive Functions

{
	
	raw-html:<p>After the Create Task, all of the CSP curriculum framework has been addressed. Units 6&ndash;8 contain additional material thatâ€™s important to computer science, but some or all of these units may be covered after the AP exam.</p>

You might ask:<ul><li>What is the difference between creating a script to swap the values of two variables and creating a script that swaps a list item with the list item just after it?</li><li>When would you want your <code>swap with next</code> block to be a command and when would you want it to be a reporter?</li><li>What would be the list input to the <code>swap with next</code> block (variable or list) in the case of it being a command block or a reporter?</li><li>What is a selection sort?</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></p><p>Tips:<ul><li><strong>Page 4: Managing List Data:</strong><ul><li>The Selection Sort Take It Further exercise is complicated.

    raw-html: <div class="todo">BRIAN: you agreed to review everything in L3 (the labs and the TG) and then make the solutions before I split it into 4 mini-labs (so that we are sure it should be split before we do it). Then you realized that this whole unit needs major attention. Good luck and please LMK how I can help. --MF, 5/23/20<p>Please also determine if the big red box at right should be integrated anywhere and then remove it. </--MF, 5/23/</p>20</div>

    raw-html: <div class="todo">Brian, as you review the comments on all of these pages, please consider which, if any, could be optional projects. It would be nice to have optional projects for this unit. Which are optional? Which are projects? Which are both? (See how I scaffolded that for you?) ;) Thanks! --MF, 6/15/20</div>
