title: Teaching Guide for Unit 4: How the Internet Works

{

h3: Purpose
	raw-html: <p><strong>Technical Focus:</strong> Network Protocols, Cybersecurity, Bits</p>
    	raw-html: <p>The three technical labs in this unit are relatively independent of each other, not telling a sequential story as in the programming-specific units.  What these labs have in common is that they meet requirements of the AP CSP Framework outside of their programming Big Idea.  Lab 1 is mainly about their Computer Systems and Networks, Lab 2 about Impact of Computing, Lab 4 about Data.  (Some parts of these Big Ideas are elsewhere in the curriculum, and some parts of other Big Ideas appear here.)  Within each lab, though, we have tried to tell a coherent, sequential story; this has sometimes required including material not directly addressing the Framework.</p>
		raw-html: <p>Lab 1 tells the story of the Internet.  Students who are younger than the Internet may have trouble understanding just how big it is, and how hard it was to design a structure that works at that scale.  Its predecessor, the Arpanet, had a hundred-odd computers; at that scale, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel">one person</a> did essentially all the work that is now the purview of ICANN, a large and politically-charged bureaucracy.  <em>Redundancy</em> is one of the key ideas, and it's one that can be important in writing software even on much smaller scales.  <em>Levels of abstraction,</em> unsurprisingly, are also crucial, especially in the four-layer hierarchy of protocols; we emphasize how TCP (transport layer) and IP (Internet layer) are central to this architecture.  We also touch briefly on the international politics of the Internet.</p>
		raw-html: <p>Lab 2 is about security, and in particular about cryptography.  By far the most important idea here is <em>public key cryptography;</em> without this invention, there could be no Internet commerce.  Try to get students to understand that this isn't just a more complicated encryption algorithm.  For example, the Enigma cypher machine used by the Germans in World War II and famously cracked by Alan Turing's team of mathematicians was enormously complicated, but it was <em>not</em> a public key system, and wouldn't last a day under the conditions of the Internet, where interception of messages is all too common.  It's not that the Enigma has gotten easier to crack; it's that in <em>any</em> symmetric-key encryption, the key itself is subject to interception.</p><p><em><u>Please</u></em> do not overemphasize the last page of this lab, on which the College Board preaches to students (through us) about password hygiene.  The only really important idea on that page is in its first sentence: "It should not be the responsibility of the individual to ensure their safety online just as it's not their responsibility to do a safety inspection of every subway car before boarding."  This is the Beauty and Joy of Computing, not the Fear and Trembling of Computing.</p>
		raw-html: <div class="endnote">Public-key encryption was invented by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman.  (It turned out later that it was earlier invented, but kept secret, at the NSA.)  Diffie and Hellman published their idea, for the benefit of the public.  The details of their algorithm weren't complete, though, and soon Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman invented, and patented, the RSA algorithm.  (Don't misunderstand; this was not a trivial piece of work, but a serious mathematical achievement.)  They founded a company, RSA Security, to license this patent, and got rich.  (It later turned out that they, too, had been anticipated by a secret intelligence agency, this time in Britain.  Had that been publicly known, RSA could not have been patented.)  This is a cautionary tale about the alleged relationship between patents and creativity.</div>
		raw-html: <p>Lab 4 is about bits, bitstreams, and numeric representation.  Probably the most important idea to emphasize is that all the representations described are arbitrary, not mathematically necessary.  In the history of computing, for example, there have been at least three representations for negative integers, and countless representations for non-integer values.  Even positive integers were once represented as "binary coded decimal," with four bits per decimal digit.  Next most important:  With <em>n</em> bits, you can represent 2<sup><small><em>n</em></small></sup> values.</p>
		raw-html: <div class="endnote">The CS Principles Framework before 2020-21 had a focus on computer hardware that has been dramatically cut back in the new Framework.  In earlier versions of BJC, what's now U4L4 was in U6, about computer hardware and systems.  This lab is what's left of the CSP hardware requirement, and U6 is now all optional material.</div>

	raw-html: <p><strong>Social Implications Focus:</strong> Community and Online interactions; Computers and Work</p>
		raw-html: <p>There's no special reason why these labs are in these two positions, except that we want to emphasize that the social implications labs aren't an afterthought.</p>
		raw-html: <p>Lab 3: Community and Online Interactions.  The early promise of the Internet was that it was going to enhance human community.  And in many ways it has!  One important example is that it's been very important to deaf people, who have trouble communicating with hearing people around them, but who are indistinguishable from everyone else on the net.  Another example is that people with obscure interests may not have anyone nearby who shares their interest, but can find like-minded people from around the world on the net.  On the other hand, we've seen in recent years how poisonous those like-minded Internet communities can become, such as the misogyny in gamer groups.  It's important not to lose sight of either the good or the bad.  And, as always, the best question to pose is "How could we design a better Internet?"</p>
		raw-html: <p>A topic we barely touch on, in considering censorship, is how the Internet both is and is not democratizing.  For a while, it seemed as if the "Arab Spring" settled that question, but in fact most of the revolutions in Arab countries have not remained democratic for long.  The net gives everyone a soap box, but the voices that aren't drowned out by noise are those of the rich and/or famous.  Cell phone penetration has brought Internet access to poor people around the world, which is great, but too often the net they access is censored.  This topic could be an entire course!</p>
		raw-html: <p>Lab 5: Computers and Work.  There are two related but separate issues in this lab:  How do computers affect the conditions of work, and how do they affect the availability of jobs?  The first of these includes things like computer-based surveillance of workers, for example to ensure that they're meeting sales quotas.  On the other hand, some of the mindless parts of jobs have been taken over by computers, leaving the more interesting parts for the human workers.  The second issue, about automation and jobs, has a conventional answer that jobs are just shifted, not lost, but that seems not to be true, or at least the available jobs are part-time and low-paying.
		
		
		//raw-html: <p>Lab 5: Censorship and Computing around the World asks students to first consider what rules perhaps <em>ought</em> to exist regarding behavior or content on the Internet. They use the <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading and what they've learned about the Internet throughout this unit to discuss the challenges of regulating the Internet. In this Lab, students will also look at ways that countries (including the United States) approach regulation and censorship of online content and will also examine statistics about Internet usage around the world.</p>
		//raw-html:<p>In Lab 8: Innovating for Social Change, students continue to familiarize themselves with the AP Explore Task requirements, specifically by examining an innovation that addresses a social issue to which they feel some personal connection. Students will first identify social issues they care about and learn some ways that technology has been used to address the issue. They will use the AP Explore Task prompts to guide them towards thinking and writing about potential benefits and possible unintended negative consequences of the innovation. </p>
		raw-html: <div class="todo">I'm not convinced that splitting up the reading is really a good strategy.  It may keep students interested, but they won't learn the parts they don't read and discuss.</div>
		raw-html:<p>There is a lot of reading in this unit. Mix it up to keep students engaged. Encourage students to take turns reading in small groups or as a class, or consider assigning different teams to the various pages of the lab and have each team present their section to the class. Choose a strategy that will work for your group of students.</p>

h3: Big Ideas 2, 6
        raw-html:<div class="todo">NEEDS EDITS</div><p>The primary focus of this unit is the <strong>Internet (Big Idea 6)</strong>. Students learn about the power of the fundamental <strong>abstractions (Big Idea 2)</strong> of the Internet including the two most essential protocols: IP, which builds one Internet out of a vast collection of local networks; and TCP, which allows the Internet to function reliably despite the lack of reliability of the physical infrastructure. Students also learn how the hierarchies of domain names and IP addresses make scalability possible.</p>
        
h3: Computational Thinking Practices P1, P3, P5, P6
        raw-html:<p>Students learn to identify and describe the <strong>abstractions (P3)</strong> of the Internet, continue to <strong>collaborate (P6)</strong> as they pair program, and <strong>communicate (P5)</strong> as they <strong>connect computing (P1)</strong> to society in the Social Implications labs.</p>
