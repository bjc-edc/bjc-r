title: Unit 7: Fractals and Recursion

{

	raw-html:<p>Please note that the topic of recursion is not formally included in the AP Computer Science Principles Curriculum Framework. At the end of Unit 6, all of the CSP curriculum framework has been addressed. Units 7 and 8 contain additional material that’s important to computer science, but some or all of Unit 7 and Unit 8 may be covered after the AP exam in May.</p>
