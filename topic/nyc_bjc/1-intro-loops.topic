{

//Is this "In this unit, you will..." section still something we want? We don't have it in any other unit... --MF
//h3: In this unit, you will...
//big-idea: Build an app (or two) using <span class="snap">snap</span>
//big-idea: Design procedures to draw, make music, animate, and interact with the user.
//big-idea: Use loops to repeat similar steps of code.
//big-idea: Create procedures inside procedures and loops within loops.
//big-idea: Explore mathematics of computer science: random, modulo, and logical operators.
//big-idea: Analyze the impact of technology on our culture and safety.

	raw-html: <div class="todo">Suggestions from Dan's work in San Mateo HS: <ul><li>I'd like to see "zoom blocks" in lab 1 early for two reasons (1) when I go around the room, I can't see what they're doing at the distance of looking at code over a kid's shoulder, and (2) default snap! size actually makes kids hunch over their laptops to see things. Laptops in general aren't ergonomic, but it's much worse when you have to move your head even closer to the screen.</li><li>In the "Whack Alonzo" lab 1.1.6, why is it suggested to put the forever loop in the "when clicked" event? The forever loop should be in the "when green flag" event script.</li><li>mini-lesson on Broadcast</li><li>mini-lesson on "input sliders" when showing how to make "pinwheel, branches" with "backup"</li></ul></div>
