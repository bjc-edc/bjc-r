heading:  Lab 1: Click Alonzo Game
	raw-html: <div class="commentBig">I vote no on animated GIFs in topic pages altogether, but in this one in particular, the "catch me if you can" is way too small to read. <p>I assume that comment is from Brian. I have no problem dropping the unreadable text, but I think a video is particularly ellucidating and engaging for some of these (e.g., Click Alonzo and U2 drawing on the stage in 3 colors), and I even think it might be nice to <em>add</em> animation to the U3 TTT image, the U4 redundant network image, and the U5 disease spread image. Would you agree to that if we made them all data-gifffers? Would data-gifffing relieve your concern with them? --MF, 12/31/19</p></div>
