title: Unit 1: Introduction to Snap<em>!</em> Programming

{

h3: In this unit, you will...
big-idea: Build an app (or two) using <span class="snap">snap</span>
big-idea: Design procedures to draw, make music, animate, and interact with the user.
big-idea: Use loops to repeat similar steps of code.
big-idea: Create procedures inside procedures and loops within loops.
big-idea: Explore mathematics of computer science: random, modulo, and logical operators.
big-idea: Analyze the impact of technology on our culture and safety.
