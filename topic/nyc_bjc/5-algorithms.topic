	raw-html: <div class="todo"><p>Brian, do we want any of this? If so, might it go better as a dev note on another page? --MF, 1/28/17 <ol><li>Time several functions, starting with ones that take non-linear time.  Graph the times against the size of the inputs. </li><li>Write a {\bf timer} program that accepts a function (and inputs) and times the computation in milliseconds.  Graph {\bf timer} with several different inputs.  Try to create different kinds of graphs.</li><li>Experiment with various functions and with different models of the same function.</li><li>Time the guessing game strategy that was developed earlier. </li><li>Time the ``number finder'' strategy that was developed earlier.</li></ol><ul><li>things that have to end up taught here: linear, quadratic, exponential</li><li>maybe log?  maybe n log n?
