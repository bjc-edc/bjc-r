title: Unit 7: Recursive and Higher-Order Functions

{
	
	raw-html:<p>Please note that the topic of recursion is not formally included in the AP Computer Science Principles Curriculum Framework. At the end of Unit 5, all of the CSP curriculum framework has been addressed. Units 6 and 7 contain additional material thatâ€™s important to computer science, but some or all of Unit 6 and Unit 7 may be covered after the AP exam in May.</p>
	raw-html: <div class="commentBig"><strong><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/7-recursive-reporters/fromU3-managing-list-data.html">"Managing List Data"</a> content cut from U3 L1 TG:</strong> <p>The last page, Managing List Data, covers a variety of common and/or illustrative programming tasks related to lists (including swapping items, filtering for uniques, and sorting).</p><p>Students will:<ul><li>Explore several concepts related to list manipulation and sorting.</li></ul></p><p>As a class:<ul><li><strong>Page 4: Managing List Data.</strong><ul><li>Discussion: Several points in this lesson are worth a brief discussion. You might ask:<ul><li>What is the difference between creating a script to swap the values of two variables and creating a script that swaps a list item with the list item just after it?</li><li>When would you want your <code>swap with next</code> block to be a command and when would you want it to be a reporter?</li><li>What would be the list input to the <code>swap with next</code> block (variable or list) in the case of it being a command block or a reporter?</li><li>What is a selection sort?</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></p><p>Tips:<ul><li><strong>Page 4: Managing List Data:</strong><ul><li>The Selection Sort Take It Further exercise is complicated. Have students who tackle this problem share any meaningful progress with the class.</li></ul></li></ul></p></div>
