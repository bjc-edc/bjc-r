You might ask:<ul><li>What is the difference between creating a script to swap the values of two variables and creating a script that swaps a list item with the list item just after it?</li><li>When would you want your <code>swap with next</code> block to be a command and when would you want it to be a reporter?</li><li>What would be the list input to the <code>swap with next</code> block (variable or list) in the case of it being a command block or a reporter?</li><li>What is a selection sort?</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></p><p>Tips:<ul><li><strong>Page 4: Managing List Data:</strong><ul><li>The Selection Sort Take It Further exercise is complicated.
