title: Teaching Guide for Unit 2: Abstraction

{

heading: Purpose
    raw-html: <p><strong>Programming Focus:</strong> Abstraction and Structure</p>
        <p>This unit deepens students' understanding of abstraction, most importantly by introducing <strong>data abstraction</strong>, in which the idea of data types is extended from the ones built into a programming language (e.g., number, text string, list) to include types that are meaningful in the context of a particular project, such as the items in a quiz, each of which includes a question and an answer.  Most of the topics introduced in this unit will be used in more depth in later units.  For example, the number guessing game in Lab 1 introduces the <em>binary search</em> algorithm, which will be an important example in the analysis of algorithms in Unit 5.  Lists and abstract data types, introduced in Lab 2, will be used in more complex ways in the contact list app of Unit 3.  Labs 3 and 4 introduce various mathematical functions, Boolean-valued (true/false) and numeric-valued, respectively.</p>
    // Due to weird parsing bug, close the default list in the topic section.
    raw-html: <p>This unit also introduces an explicit discussion of <strong>debugging</strong> techniques.</p>

    raw-html: <p><strong>Social Implications Focus:</strong> Media, Sharing, and Copyright</p>
    raw-html: <p>Copyrights are often discussed in a "computer ethics" orientation: "Don't violate copyrights!" This is not the BJC approach to social issues.  First, this curriculum doesn't lecture students about what they should or shouldn't do; that's not the job of a curriculum.  Second, the rights and wrongs of copyright law aren't as simple as many people assume.  Unit 2 Lab 5 Page 3 quotes the relevant part of the US Constitution, which emphasizes that copyright is, despite the name, not a <em>right</em> in the way that freedom of speech is a right.  Copyright is a <em>limited-time</em> monopoly whose social purpose is to get all creations eventually into the public domain.  BJC's goal is to get students to think as creatively about social problems as they do about technical problems:  "Okay, you don't want to have to pay for music, so how do you propose we support musicians so that they can keep making music?"  Streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify are one attempt at an answer, but they just introduce one more middleman between the musician and the listener.</p>

heading: Big Ideas: AAP, IOC; and Computational Thinking Practices and Skills: 1.D, 2.B, 3.A, 3.B, 4.B
    raw-html:<p>As they implement an algorithm for a guessing game, students use a local variable to store a randomly generated secret number and a global variable to store the player's score (Skills: <strong>2.B</strong>, <strong>3.A</strong>; Big Idea: <strong>AAP</strong>). In doing so, they learn how to assign a value to a variable and how to determine the result of sequential variable assignments (Skill: <strong>4.B</strong>; Big Idea: <strong>APP</strong>). Next, they use lists to store character costume options and shopping list items in preparation for building a quiz app that uses abstract data types and list traversal (Skills: <strong>2.B</strong>, <strong>3.B</strong>; Big Idea: <strong>AAP</strong>). Students then focus on using predicates in conditionals, to filter lists, and to code mathematical functions (Skill: <strong>2.B</strong>; Big Idea: <strong>AAP</strong>). Along the way, they determine and compare the results of various code segments (Skills: <strong>1.D</strong>, <strong>4.B</strong>; Big Idea: <strong>AAP</strong>). In their investigations of copyright, students its history, purpose, laws, evolution, and enforcement (Big Idea: <strong>IOC</strong>).</p>

heading: Enduring Understandings: AAP-1, AAP-2, AAP-3, IOC-1
    raw-html:<p>In Lab 1: Games, students begin using variables to generalize solutions and to store values; extend their use of sequencing to include list operations; and develop a more complicated algorithm using selection (<strong>AAP-1</strong>, <strong>AAP-2</strong>, <strong>AAP-3</strong>). In Lab 2: Making Lists, students extend their use of variables to store lists; begin their use of abstract data types; and extend their use of iteration to include list traversal (<strong>AAP-1</strong>, <strong>AAP-2</strong>). In Lab 3: Making Decisions, students extend their use of arithmetic operators; formalize their use of relational operators; extend their use of selection to include nested selection; and formalize their understanding of Boolean values as they begin to use logical operators (<strong>AAP-2</strong>). In Lab 4: Making Computers Do Math, students formalize their use of arithmetic operators and extend it to include the modulus operator; formalize their use of conditionals; and use these skills to develop a library of mathematical functions for use in future projects (<strong>AAP-2</strong>, <strong>AAP-3</strong>). In Lab 5: Copyrights, students extend their exploration of the unintended impacts of computing to include copyright (<strong>IOC-1</strong>). </p>
