	raw-html: <div class="todo"><ul><li>PG: I've moved to the bitter end everything that had been commented out so that I could read this thing.</li><li>9/24/15 we agreed to change the two GS lab titles to normal names. Change L1 GS to "Sprite Drawing Puzzles" and L4 GS to "Searching for Yourself Online"</li><li>Email from Teacher: We have found the labs in Unit 2 to be too long and involved. I believe they need to be split up into smaller chunks. I also have found the time estimates to be way off. My classes were working fairly diligently for almost 3 weeks on Unit 2 labs 1 and 2 and not all students were able to complete both labs. Students are working on Lab 3 now and it is going a little faster but I still think the time estimates are extremely aggressive for my student population.</li><li>Add multiple sprites and multiple costumes to this unit.</li><ul></div>
