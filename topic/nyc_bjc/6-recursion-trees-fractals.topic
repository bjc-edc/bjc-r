title: Unit 6: Trees and Other Fractals
{
	raw-html:<div class="takeNote">Please note: This unit is currently under development.</div>

//h2: Big Ideas
//big-idea: Understand the techniques to solving a computer science problem recursively.
//big-idea: See examples of recursion in nature and art and its relationship to how we already conceptualize various aspects of our world.

//    video: Recursion I [https://coursesharing.org/courses/6/lectures/17]
//    reading: Blown to Bits, Chapter 5 [http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter5.pdf]

//h2: Activities

//learning-goal: Explore the idea of representing a problem in terms of itself.
//learning-goal: Practice planning and coding recursive blocks.

//h2: Reminder
//big-idea: Make sure you watch the first recursion lecture before doing this lab!
