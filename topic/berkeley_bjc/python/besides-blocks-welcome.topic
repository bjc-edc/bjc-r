h2: Big Ideas
big-idea: Computational Thinking is the idea of how you solve a problem. This process can be applied to any language.
big-idea: Python and <span class="snap">snap</span> are awesome languages which coexist. 
big-idea: After learning one language, the few languages you learn will be much easier. What you're learning is "how to learn".
big-idea: Text based languages are just as power as visual languages and come with their own set of pros and cons.

h2: Activities
