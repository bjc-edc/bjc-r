title: Besides Blocks: Data Structures and Python
{
h2: Big Ideas
big-idea: Data Structures are a way to help programmers organize items in ways which are easier to manipulate and understand.
big-idea: Lists are a basic data structure which exist in just about every language.
big-idea: "Key-Value Pairs" are a very easy way to create simple relationships among different data.
big-idea: Python dictionaries utilize key-value pairs to make organizing certain kinds of data much more effecient.

h2: Activities
learning-goal: Get more practice writing functions in Python.
learning-goal: Manipulate simple data structures and their data.
learning-goal: Learn how to use key-value pairs and why they are useful.
learning-goal: Solve problems with Python lists and dictionaries.
