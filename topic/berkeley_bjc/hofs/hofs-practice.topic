title: Practice with HOFs and Functions as Data
{
h2: Big Ideas
big-idea: There are more to HOFs than just map, keep, and combine.
big-idea: Functions can be treated as data, just like strings, numbers, and lists.
big-idea: Creating our own higher-order function blocks allows us to achieve a whole new level of generality in our programs.

h2: Activities
learning-goal: Build non-HOF blocks to use as helper functions in larger HOFs problems.
learning-goal: Complete complex, multi-step HOFs problems.
learning-goal: Use HOFs to solve real-life problems, like minimizing or composing functions.
