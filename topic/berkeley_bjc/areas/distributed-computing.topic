h2: Activities

learning-goal: Digital devices, systems, and the networks that interconnect them enable and foster computational approaches to solving problems. (This is from AP's big ideas Section VI.)
learning-goal: MapReduce is a particularly nice example of a distributed computing pattern, and the facility to write (and debug, and test, and evaluate) programs in our simplified MapReduce abstraction.
