		raw-html:<p>This unit starts with the basics of functional programming&mdash;creating abstractions in the form of reporters (i.e., functions) and predicates (i.e., functions that return Booleans) through control structures, to using the higher-order functions <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>. Students explore the Snap<em>!</em> programing environment using functions to process inputs, which may themselves be the outputs of other functions. After learning the basics of working in Snap<em>!</em>, students create projects with using lists, sounds, and other common data types (numbers, text, emojis, etc.) as they learn the basics of bits, characters, and how functions behave.</p>
