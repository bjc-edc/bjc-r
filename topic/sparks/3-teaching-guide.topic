		raw-html:<p>This unit extends student work with sequencing and iteration into the realm of physical computing using the micro:bit controller. Students use craft materials to build a toy and game; use e-textile materials (e.g., conductive thread, LEDs, and sensors) to create circuits; use neopixels to program creations to change colors, twinkle, and pulse; and program micro:bits to send and receive messages. The unit culminates with building collaborative chain reaction (Rube Goldberg) machines.</p>
