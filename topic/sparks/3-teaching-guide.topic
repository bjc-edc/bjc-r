		raw-html:<p>This unit extends student work with sequencing and iteration into the realm of physical computing using the micro:bit controller. Students use craft materials to build a toy and game; use e-textile materials (e.g., conductive thread, LEDs, and sensors) to create circuits; use neopixels to program creations to change colors, twinkle, and pulse; and program micro:bits to send and receive messages. The unit culminates with building collaborative chain reaction (Rube Goldberg) machines.</p>

Please adjust as needed. Some of these have been covered in other units; some have not. --MF, 10/23/21</div>
			<p><ul>
			<li><strong>2-CS-01:</strong> Recommend improvements to the design of computing devices, based on an analysis of how users interact with the devices.</li>
			<li><strong>2-CS-02:</strong> Design projects that combine hardware and software components to collect and exchange data.</li>
			<li><strong>2-CS-03:</strong> Systematically identify and fix problems with computing devices and their components.</li>
			<div class="comment">2-AP-13 and 2-AP-13 are also covered in <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=sparks/1-teaching-guide.topic&course=sparks-teacher.html&novideo&noassignment">U1</a>, and these are planned for <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=sparks/2-teaching-guide.topic&course=sparks-teacher.html&novideo&noassignment">U2</a>: <ul><li>2-AP-10</li><li>2-AP-11</li><li>2-AP-12</li><li>2-AP-13</li><li>2-AP-14</li><li>2-AP-16</li><li>2-AP-17</li></ul></div>
			<li><strong>2-AP-10: </strong> Use flowcharts and/or pseudocode to address complex problems as algorithms.</li>
			<li><strong>2-AP-11:</strong> Create clearly named variables that represent different data types and perform operations on their values.</li>
			<li><strong>2-AP-12:</strong> Design and iteratively develop programs that combine control structures, including nested loops and compound conditionals.</li>
			<li><strong>2-AP-13:</strong> Decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs.</li>
			<li><strong>2-AP-14:</strong> Create procedures with parameters to organize code and make it easier to reuse.</li>
			<li><strong>2-AP-15:</strong> Seek and incorporate feedback from team members and users to refine a solution that meets user needs.</li>
			<li><strong>2-AP-16:</strong> Incorporate existing code, media, and libraries into original programs, and give attribution.</li>
			<li><strong>2-AP-17:</strong> Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases.</li>
			<li><strong>2-AP-18</strong> Distribute tasks and maintain a project timeline when collaboratively developing computational artifacts.</li>
			<li><strong>2-IC-22:</strong> Collaborate with many contributors through strategies such as crowdsourcing or surveys when creating a computational artifact.</li>
