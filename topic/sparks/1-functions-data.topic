//heading: Unit 1 Project
	raw-html: <div class="todo"><h3>Unit 1 Project</h3><p>Brian: Starter project has encrypt/decrypt functions.  Student A chooses a password, uses the project to encrypt a text, then exports the encrypted text and sends that to student B, who imports it into their copy of the project (which doesn't include student A's key). Maybe have two cyphers in the project, one of which is simple substitution and therefore pretty easily breakable, and let kids break it, then use a more complicated cypher that's resistant to letter frequency attacks. I did a Playfair cypher in Computer Science Logo Style if anyone wants an example... Brian thinks it will be fun to break ciphers.</p><p>Implementing Vigen�re? (Maybe not exciting enough since everyone is doing the same thing?)
