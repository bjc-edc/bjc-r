//h1: Topic 15: Besides Blocks: Welcome to Python!

//h2: Big Ideas
//big-idea: Computational Thinking is the idea of how you solve a problem. This process can be applied to any language.
//big-idea: Python and <span class="snap">snap</span> are awesome languages which coexist. 
//big-idea: After learning one language, the few languages you learn will be much easier. What you're learning is "how to learn".
//big-idea: Text based languages are just as power as visual languages and come with their own set of pros and cons.

//h2: Activities
//learning-goal: Start playing with Python by using the command line.
//learning-goal: Learn the basics of Python syntax and write a few simple programs.
//learning-goal: You should be comfortable with basic math and "string" operations.

//h1: Formerly Topic 16: Besides Blocks: Data Structures and Python

//h2: Big Ideas
//big-idea: Data Structures are a way to help programmers organize items in ways which are easier to manipulate and understand.
//big-idea: Lists are a basic data structure which exist in just about every language.
//big-idea: "Key-Value Pairs" are a very easy way to create simple relationships among different data.
//big-idea: Python dictionaries utilize key-value pairs to make organizing certain kinds of data much more effecient.

//h2: Activities
//learning-goal: Get more practice writing functions in Python.
//learning-goal: Manipulate simple data structures and their data.
//learning-goal: Learn how to use key-value pairs and why they are useful.
//learning-goal: Solve problems with Python lists and dictionaries.
