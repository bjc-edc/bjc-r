        <h3>Editing blocks in a working program</h3>
        You can improve this program by editing <code>who</code> and <code>does what</code> to give them more (or different) language.
		<div class="forYouToDo">
         	<ol start="11">
            	<li>Here's how to edit <code>who</code> to give it more names.
                    <ul>
                    <strong>TO EDIT <em>ANY</em> BLOCK,</strong>
            			<li><strong>Control-click</strong> (or right-click) on that block and choose "edit..." <br />
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this case, control-click on <strong>who</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Make your changes</strong>.  <br />
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this case, you'll find further instructions inside the block.</li>
                        <li><strong>Click OK</strong> when you're satisfied. (Or click "Cancel" if you don't want to make the changes). </li>
                    </ul>	
				</li>
                <li>Now edit <code>does what</code>. Be creative and funny (but thoughtful)!</li>
                <li>Edit <code>who2</code> (in Sprite(2)'s script) to make it better.</li>
