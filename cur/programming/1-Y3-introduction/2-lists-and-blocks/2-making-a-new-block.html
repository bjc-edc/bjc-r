		<h2>Improving Gossip by Making a New Block</h2>
		<h3>Making a New Block</h3>
        <code>gossip2</code> always starts the same way.  "Oh, but..." can get boring. <br />
        <p>In this activity, you will create your own new block that varies how <code>gossip2</code> starts. Your new block will work just like <code>who</code> and <code>does what</code> but you will give it several starter phrases like "Oh, but" and "I heard that" and "Who cares! Did you hear?" (or whatever you like). You will use your new block instead of the fixed text "Oh, but...." </p>
        <p><strong>Making new blocks</strong> is a lot like editing existing blocks.</p>
        Here's how:
        
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">  
        <ol>
        <li> Open your project, U1L1-Gossip. (Make sure you are logged in.)</li>
</ol>
       </div>
<iframe width="100%" height="500px" src="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#” " frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
        You can improve this program by editing <code>who</code> and <code>does what</code> and giving them more (or different) language to use! 
        	<ol start="2">
            	<li><strong>TO MAKE A NEW BLOCK,</strong>
                    <ul>
                    	<li><strong>Control-click</strong> (or right-click) anywhere on the scripting area <em>except</em> on a block, and choose "make a block..." </li>
                        <li><strong>Type <code>gossip starter</code></strong> as the title for this block.</li>
                        <li><strong>Select the oval <em>Reporter</em> shape.</strong>.  <br />
                        (You will learn more about this selection later.)</li>
                        <li>From the orange palette, drag in    <img src="/list.png" width="69" height="22" alt="list block"> and    <img src="/item.png" width="117" height="22" alt="the item block">.</li>
                        <li>Click on the &quot;1&quot; in <code>item</code>, and select <em>random.</em></li>
                        <li>Fill <code>list</code> with whatever you need.</li>
                        <li><strong>Click OK</strong> when you're satisfied. </li>
                    </ul>	
				</li>
                
                <div class="saveAs"><span class="text">"U1L2-Gossip"</span><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-this-as.png" alt="Save your work as U1L2-Gossip" title="Save your work as U1L2-Gossip" /></div>
                </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote">
            Every block needs a place to "live" (a <strong>palette</strong>, shown by the color), a <strong>title</strong>, a <strong>category</strong> (shown by the shape of the block), and a <strong>script</strong> that defines its behavior.
			<ul>
				<li> 
                    <div class="sideHOMbig">You can put the new block in any palette that makes sense to you. If you don't choose a palette/color, your block will be a gray "Other" block and will be sorted into the "Variables" tab.</div> 
                    <strong>Palette:</strong> Choose a palette for your new block to go into. ("Motion" or "Pen" might be appropriate for the <code>draw square</code> block.)<br />
                    <!--<img  alt="'make a block' dialog box" width="260" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/make-a-block-BYOB.png" >-->
                </li>
                <div class="manual">You can find more information  in the <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/help/SnapManual.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Snap Manual pages 17-18</a>.</div>
                <li> 
                    <strong>Title:</strong> Give your block a name. For this block, type "draw square" as shown here.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/make-draw-square-block.png" alt="Make a command block" title="Make a command block" />
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Category:</strong> Leave "Command" selected since this block  performs an action (drawing a square) rather than  reporting a value. 
              </li>
                <li><strong>For all sprites.</strong>
                  <!--<div class="takeNote">
                    You've seen commands before and also reporters, which report information, like this:
                    <p class="center">
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/x-position-reporting--79.png" alt="x position reporting -79" title="x position reporting -79" />
                    <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/sqrt-of-25-reporting-5.png" alt="Sqrt of 25 reporting 5" title="Sqrt of 25 reporting 5" />
                    </p>
                    
                </div>-->
                  In this course, you will almost always want to keep "for all sprites" selected, so you can ignore that choice for now, and click "OK".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Behavior:</strong> A dialog titled "Block Editor" will appear. Build the instructions for your new block here just as you do in the scripting area. <!--<a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-drawing-interaction/1-exploring-snap-drawing-motion.html#building">-->Drag blocks from the palette to define the script that will run when your custom block is used. When you are finished, click OK or Apply.<br />

                </li>
				<div class="takeNote">The editor starts you with a hat block that contains a picture of your block. Remember that hat blocks say when the script below them should run: <code>when flag clicked</code>, <code>when space key pressed</code>, etc. This hat block says, "when the <code>draw square</code> block is used." (Don't worry about the <strong>+</strong> signs for the moment; they just let you add more words or <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-building-blocks/2-adding-an-input.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">inputs</a>.)</div>
