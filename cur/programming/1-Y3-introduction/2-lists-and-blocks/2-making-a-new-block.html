		<h2>Improving Gossip by Making a New Block</h2>
		<h3>Making a New Block</h3>
        <code>gossip2</code> always starts the same way.  "Oh, but..." can get boring. <br />
        <code>gossip2</code> always starts with  "Oh, but...." That can get boring. <br />
        <p>In this activity, you will create a block that randomly chooses starter phrases like "Oh, but" or "And did you hear that" or &quot;Who cares!&quot; (or whatever you like).  </p>
        
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">  
        <ol>
        <li> Open your project, U1L1-Gossip. (Make sure you are logged in.)</li>
</ol>
       </div>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="2">
            <li><strong>TO MAKE A NEW BLOCK,</strong>
                    <ul>
                    	<li><strong>Control-click</strong> (or right-click) anywhere on the scripting area <em>except</em> on a block, and choose "make a block..." </li>
                        <li><strong>Type <code>gossip starter</code></strong> as the title for this block.</li>
                        <li><strong>Select a shape.</strong>.  <br />
                        For <em>this</em> block, you will need the oval <em>Reporter</em> shape. (You'll learn why later.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Drag in the blocks you need and build the script.</strong> <br />
                        For <em>this</em> block, you will need <img src="/list.png" alt="the list block"> and  <img src="/item.png" alt="the item block">.</li>
                        <li>Adjust any inputs that need adjusting <br />
                        For <em>this</em> block, click on the &quot;1&quot; in <code>item</code>, and select <em>random.</em> <br />
                        Then fill <code>list</code> with whatever you need.</li>
                        <li><strong>Click OK</strong> when you're satisfied. </li>
                    </ul>	
			  </li>
                <li>Now edit <code>gossip2</code> and slide your new block in to replace the fixed text "Oh, but...."</li>
                Your new block will work just like <code>who</code> and <code>does what</code>.
                <div class="saveAs"><span class="text">"U1L2-Gossip"</span><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-this-as.png" alt="Save your work as U1L2-Gossip" title="Save your work as U1L2-Gossip" /></div>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote">
            Every block needs a place to "live" (a <strong>palette</strong>, shown by the color), a <strong>title</strong>, a <strong>category</strong> (shown by the shape of the block), and a <strong>script</strong> that defines its behavior.
			<ul>
				<li> 
                    <div class="sideHOMbig">You can put the new block in any palette that makes sense to you. If you don't choose a palette/color, your block will be a gray "Other" block and will be sorted into the "Variables" tab.</div> 
                    <strong>Palette:</strong> Choose a palette for your new block to go into. ("Motion" or "Pen" might be appropriate for the <code>draw square</code> block.)<br />

                </li>
                <div class="manual">You can find more information  in the <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/help/SnapManual.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Snap Manual pages 17-18</a>.</div>
                <li> 
                    <strong>Title:</strong> Give your block a name. For this block, type "draw square" as shown here.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/make-draw-square-block.png" alt="Make a command block" title="Make a command block" />
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Category:</strong> Leave "Command" selected since this block  performs an action (drawing a square) rather than  reporting a value. 
              </li>
                <li><strong>For all sprites.</strong>
                  <!--<div class="takeNote">
                    You've seen commands before and also reporters, which report information, like this:
                    <p class="center">
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/x-position-reporting--79.png" alt="x position reporting -79" title="x position reporting -79" />
                    <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/sqrt-of-25-reporting-5.png" alt="Sqrt of 25 reporting 5" title="Sqrt of 25 reporting 5" />
                    </p>
                    
                </div>-->
                  In this course, you will almost always want to keep "for all sprites" selected, so you can ignore that choice for now, and click "OK".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Behavior:</strong> A dialog titled "Block Editor" will appear. Build the instructions for your new block here just as you do in the scripting area. <!--<a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-drawing-interaction/1-exploring-snap-drawing-motion.html#building">-->Drag blocks from the palette to define the script that will run when your custom block is used. When you are finished, click OK or Apply.<br />

                </li>
				<div class="takeNote">The editor starts you with a hat block that contains a picture of your block. Remember that hat blocks say when the script below them should run: <code>when flag clicked</code>, <code>when space key pressed</code>, etc. This hat block says, "when the <code>draw square</code> block is used." (Don't worry about the <strong>+</strong> signs for the moment; they just let you add more words or <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-building-blocks/2-adding-an-input.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">inputs</a>.)</div>
