		<h2>Improving Gossip by Making a New Block</h2>
		<h3>Making a New Block</h3>
        <code>gossip2</code> always starts with  "Oh, but...." That can get boring. <br />
        <p>In this activity, you will create a block that randomly chooses starter phrases like "Oh, but" or "And did you hear that" or &quot;Who cares!&quot; (or whatever you like).  </p>
        
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">  
        <ol>
        <li> Open your project, U1L1-Gossip. (Make sure you are logged in.)</li>
</ol>
       </div>
<iframe width="100%" height="500px" src="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#” " frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="2">
            <li><strong>TO MAKE A NEW BLOCK,</strong>
                    <ul><div class="comment">A video might be good here. We need the clarity of screencastOmatic's tracking of the mouse.</div>
                    	<li><strong>Control-click</strong> (or right-click) on any empty spot on the scripting area, and choose "make a block..." </li>
                        <li><strong>Type a title for your block.</strong> <br /> 
                        &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; For <em>this</em> block, use the title <code>gossip starter</code>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Select a shape.</strong>.  <br />
                        &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; For <em>this</em> block, choose the oval <em>Reporter</em> shape. (You'll learn why later.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Drag in the blocks you need and build the script.</strong> <br />
                        &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; For <em>this</em> block, you need <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/list.png" alt="the list block"> and  <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/item.png" alt="the item block">.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fill any inputs</strong> that need to be filled.<br />
                        &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; For <em>this</em> block, click on the &quot;1&quot; in <code>item</code>, and select <em>random.</em> <br />
                        &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Then fill <code>list</code> with whatever you need.</li>
                        <li><strong>Click OK</strong> when you're satisfied. </li>
                    </ul>	
			  </li>
          <div class="endnote">
				Every block needs a <strong>title</strong>, a <strong>nature</strong> (shown by the block's shape), and a <strong>script</strong> that defines its behavior. It also needs a place to "live" (a <strong>palette</strong>, shown by the color). You can choose any palette/color that makes sense to you, or leave it gray. For now, these gray "Other" blocks live in the "Variables" palette.
	     </div>
                <li>Now edit <code>gossip2</code> and slide your new block in to replace the fixed text "Oh, but...."</li>
                </ol>
                </div>

	<h3>Checking and debugging</h3>
		It's good practice to save your work often. You will also want to give your programs a good workout, testing them to see if you are satisfied with the way they work. In general, first test the <em>parts  that you've just changed</em>, and if they work well, then test the whole program.
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="4">
                <li>Check it out! Click <code>gossip2</code> a few times to make sure it's working the way you want. Fix any things that still need work.</li>
                <li>Now switch back to the gray sprite and click on its script to check the whole program. </li>
                Your new block will work just like <code>who</code> and <code>does what</code>.
