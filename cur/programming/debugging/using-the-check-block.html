        <p>
            As we observed on the previous page the check block is most useful at points in our code where we expect things to change
            in a certain predicatble way.  We can then input a predicate to enforce what we think should happen and the check block will catch us if
            something goes wrong.  We are then left with what to put inside the C-shaped area.  Using the
            <img class="inline" alt="show variable block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/show-variable.png"> block is often a good idea as we can display the values
            that seem to be going wrong; however, we can also place say blocks or other things into this area if we think that they will give us helpful
            hints as to what the error might be.
