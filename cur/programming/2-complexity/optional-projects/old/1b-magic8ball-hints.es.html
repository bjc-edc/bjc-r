        	A list is the natural choice to use in storing the answer options you will need to access in your modeling of the toy.<br />
        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Magic8Ball_img/list.es.png" height="50" alt="list{Outlook uncertain, Probably yes, No way, It is certain, Not likely, Reply hazy, Maybe, Without a doubt}" title="list{Outlook uncertain, Probably yes, No way, It is certain, Not likely, Reply hazy, Maybe, Without a doubt}"  />

        <p>
        	Under the "Variables" block menu, Snap<em>!</em> provides some very handy blocks to store data in a list, together with some blocks that allow you to access and modify the stored data.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Magic8Ball_img/listBlocks.es.png" height="400" alt="List blocks: list(), () in front of (), item(1) of (), all but first of (), length of (), () contains (thing), add (thing) to (), delete (1) of (), insert (thing) at (1) of (), replace item (1) of () with (thing)" title="List blocks: list(), () in front of (), item(1) of (), all but first of (), length of (), () contains (thing), add (thing) to (), delete (1) of (), insert (thing) at (1) of (), replace item (1) of () with (thing)"  />
        </p>
        <p>You can then use <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Magic8Ball_img/randomListItem.es.png" height="35" alt="item(random) of ()" title="item(random) of ()" /> to randomly select an answer stored in the list.</p>
