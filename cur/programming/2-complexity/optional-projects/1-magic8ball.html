            <p>
                Changes I have made here that need review (compare with <a href="https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/optional-projects/1-magic8ball.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="" target="_blank">live version</a>):
                <ul>
                    <li>Removed problem 1 and moved image up to pink box.</li>
                    <li>Cut the link to the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/optional-projects/1b-magic8ball-hints.html" target="_blank" title="Hints">hints page</a>. <strong>Need to double-check that all they have been introduced to all of the blocks they'll need to do this project.</strong></li>
                    <li>Changed and reduced the text of the primary problem.</li>
                    <li>Moved the wikipedia link from a problem to a yellow box.</li>
                    <li>Cut all the stray HTML at the bottom. (Look at my 9/26/18 git commit to see it)</li>
                    <li>Made light edits and left comment on TIFs</li>

            <p><strong>In this project,</strong> you will build an automated fortune telling program inspired by the <em>Magic 8 Ball</em><sup>&reg</sup> that randomly offers answers to YES/NO questions.</p>

                <li>Create your own fortune-telling app. You can personalize it as you like. For example, you might change the messages; use other images for the costumes, and maybe even add sounds.</li>
                <div class="endnote">
                    <p>You may wish to look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball" target="_blank" title="Magic 8-Ball">Wikipedia entry for Magic 8 Ball</a><sup>&reg;</sup> for some possible responses that the app can give to a yes/no question.  Notice that of the twenty possible answers listed, ten are affirmative (<span style="color:green">green</span>), five are non-committal (<span style="color: yellow">yellow</span>), and five are negative (<span style="color:red">red</span>).</p>
                    <p>
                        You can import images and sound files from your desktop into your Snap<em>!</em> document by dragging and dropping them into the Costumes and Sounds tabs respectively, as shown in the video below.<br />

                <li>Trick your friends to think that your automated fortune teller actually knows things and tells the truth.  Create a version of your model that allows you to select among a certain type of choices when a particular key is <em>secretly</em> pressed.  For example, when the key “1” is pressed only affirmative answers are chosen, when the key “2” is pressed only non-committal answers are chosen, when the key “3” is pressed only negative answers are chosen.</li>
                <div class="comment">I don't understand what is intended here... --MF, 9/26/18</div>
                <li>Fortune telling machines have been popular in our culture for a long time. For example, in the movie "Big", starring Tom Hanks, Josh, the protagonist, as a young boy, is granted a life-changing wish by the magical automated fortune teller Zoltar.  Create your own fortune telling program that goes beyond giving simple answers to YES/NO questions.</li>
