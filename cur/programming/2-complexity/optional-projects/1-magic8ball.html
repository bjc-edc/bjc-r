        <h2>Automated Fortune Teller</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>PG: It's optional, but still feels like "why am I doing it?" "why is it being suggested?" No obvious learning goal, even as an optional project. But, fine, whatever, it's optional. PLEASE don't "trick your friends to think…actually knows…truth." That is (to me) so offensive, not to mention so unrealistic.  And "have fun but please be nice" is even more offensive.  The first says the kid should not be trustworthy, and the second says we don't trust the kid.  Wow!</p>

            <p>MF: I made edits on 9/26/18 that need review; have they learned about sound blocks (I don't think so)</p>

            <p><strong>In this project,</strong> you will build an automated fortune telling program inspired by the <em>Magic 8 Ball</em><sup>&reg;</sup> that randomly offers answers to YES/NO questions. Click the video below to watch the app in action.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Create your own fortune-telling app. You can personalize it as you like. For example, you might create your own messages.</li>
            </ol>
                <div class="endnote">
                    <p>You may wish to look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball" target="_blank" title="Magic 8-Ball">Wikipedia entry for Magic 8 Ball</a><sup>&reg;</sup> for some possible responses that the app could give to a yes/no question.  Notice that of the twenty possible answers listed, ten are affirmative (<span style="color:green">green</span>), five are non-committal (<span data-a11y-errors="true" style="color: goldenrod;">yellow</span>), and five are negative (<span data-a11y-errors="true" style="color:red;">red</span>).</p>

                    Personalize your project; use other images for the costumes, and maybe even add sounds.

                        <div class="comment">BH: Unlike what [the video shows], you don't have to switch to costumes/sounds tab before dragging in pictures/sounds, and you don't have to drop them on the middle area. You can drop them anywhere in the Snap! window.</div>
                        You can import images and sound files from your desktop into your project by dragging and dropping them into the Snap<em>!</em> window.<br />

                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>Trick your friends into thinking that your automated fortune teller actually knows things and tells the truth.  Create a version of your model that allows you to select among a certain type of choices when a particular key is <em>secretly</em> pressed.  For example, maybe when the key “1” is pressed only affirmative answers are chosen, when the key “2” is pressed only non-committal answers are chosen, when the key “3” is pressed only negative answers are chosen.</li>
