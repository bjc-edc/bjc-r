                    Create a second sprite that mirrors the movement of the first one.
                    <div class="endnote">
                        <p>One way to create the second sprite is to duplicate the first one and modify it. Right-click the sprite-button in the sprite corral (in the lower right of the Snap<em>!</em> window), and select "duplicate" from the context menu that appears. The new sprite will have the same scripts as the original, which is why duplication is easier than creating new sprites from scratch.</p>
