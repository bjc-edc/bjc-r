            <p>PG: "On this page, you vill create a design called (by somebody) a 'mandala,' vether you vant to or not, and ve von't tell you why!" The design is beautiful, but we need to think what is to be /learned/ and we need to make that clear to the student."You can also save and use coordinates that are produced by /your program/." And "mandala" is not what this is called. Period. There are mandalas, this bears a resemblance and /could/ be called a mandala, but this is not "called a mandala."  TIF B is a callout to "cultures" but I'm not sure it can feel genuine.</p>
            <p>BH: Flush TIF B, add a (new first) TIF about eliminating the redundant segment drawing.</p>
            <p>MF: SCRAP.feels more like an optional project; is it needed? The debugging block is nice, as is the re-use of POLYGON, but it seems like an optional project</p>
	        <p>BH: I think the technique of remembering where you've been is useful to keep, that's why I like it.</p>

            <div><span>Jasmine:</span> So let's make our <code>polygon</code> block  store each vertex as a <code>point</code> <em>while</em> it draws the polygon. We  listed  points as <em>we</em> clicked on them. This is the same, but with the <em>program</em> generating the points.</div>
            <div class="todo">I wonder if it would help to use the term ADT in the previous sentence somewhere. --MF, 3/25/19</div>

            <div class="todo">No reason to use an image rather than just <code>add</code> here. --MF, 3/25/19  Maybe it's a reminder that they're using lists? -bh</div>

            <div><span> Omar:</span> Well, we need to use it inside <code>polygon</code> <em>and</em> in the script that draws the design, so I'd make it global so multiple scripts can access it.</div>

            <div><span> Morgan:</span> Perfect! Pick <em>one</em> vertex and use <code>for each</code> to connect <em>just that one</em> to each other vertex.  After that, it's easy! We can use that block on <em>each</em> vertex.</div>
