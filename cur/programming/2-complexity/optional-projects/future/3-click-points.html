            <p>PG: The /purpose/ of this (and the last) is never made clear. Computers can help us collect data. Sometimes, we want to pull the data off of an image: of a graph, a letter, the coordinates of features of a face, the measurements of some bridge….  This lesson shows how to import an image and digitize particular points that can later be used to reproduce the image or be processed in some other way.</p>

It may belong to U3 if we end up doing the "simple studio" project (my interview submission) for which this could be a prelude.  Also looking at your solution, I see some non-trivial steps, -not just the recursive "all of" predicate, but overall subtle sequencing of code-  I don't see how the kids will succeed with this little help.</div>   -->

            <p>Selim: If you look at my ugly, ragged E, it's that way because I just eyeballed the vertices instead of having an actual printed E to work from. On the previous page, they draw an A on graph paper before entering the coordinates.

    For the purpose of entering points interactively, the approach on this page is all you need. But if you wanted to create a more robust point-gathering program, this approach has a couple of weaknesses:
    <ul>
                    <li>Even after you tell the sprite to stop following the mouse, the "when I am clicked" script is still ready to run,  so if you click directly on the sprite, it will still add points to the list. You may not want that.</li>
                    <li>The list of points is always kept in the same global variable. So it's messy to create lists for several different letters.</li>
                </ul>

		    <ol type="A">
            	<li>Think, and see if you can find your own way to solve one or both of these problems.</li>
                <li>Here is <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/5-click-points.html" title="Alternative: Clicking Points to Capture Coordinates">an alternative approach</a> that contains a new idea that you might like. There are simpler solutions than this, but the idea behind this slightly more complicated code is a useful one.
