                <li>The [lab] title: “Using Variables and Data Structures to Make Art”—Data Structures are all over this, but I see no use of “variable.” Radical suggestion: Maybe this won’t work, but can we save “variable” for things that get assigned and use “input” for things that get passed in when a command or reporter is called?</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>The title has already been changed, but I kept the comment because of the question. Thoughts, Brian? --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>
                <li>Radical suggestion: Do we need to declare data types? It’s just one more thing for the user to track.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>No, but we do it in our blocks, so we thought we should show how it's done. I think it should be in a yellow box. Brian, why did you opt for green? --MF, 5/16/18</li>
                    <li>PG: Simplify. Content feels important. I agree with Mary's handling of Rad sug #2.  I bet it was me, not Brian, who went green on this, but not because I thought that was essential.  Yellow is fine.  I'd rather see it altogether in a "click if you feel like" block, whose surface shows the change and says something like "if you want to know how..."</li>
                </ul>
                <li># 1: What does it mean: “Load and build their go to point block.” And when I load it, I see a list.</li>

                <p>Yes, <em>you</em> can make <em>your</em> blocks show what type of data they expect as inputs: a number, a list, or some other type. Some languages <em>require</em> the data type to be indicated. In Snap<em>!</em> it's an option. It's not necessary but, like assigning a color to a block, it can be a helpful reminder of what the block does and what type of input it expects. You've already seen input slots of several shapes, indicating different expected data types. </p>

        <p>Computers can help us collect data. Sometimes, we want to pull the data off of an image: of a graph, a letter, the coordinates of features of a face, the measurements of some bridge….

                <p>Alphie and Betsy are building a program that will take a list of points (each of which is a list of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates) as input and connect the dots. They figure they can use it to draw pictures or graphs of data:</p>
                <p>
      To make a set of starting data, they sketched the letter A on graph paper. They chose a <em>scale</em> that they figured would make their picture a good size on the stage.<br />
                    <div class="todo">
                    ST-Many NYC teachers were confused and thought they are creating the list A themselves whereas we give it to them in the starter file.

                   <br />
  Then they  listed  the coordinates of each vertex, starting at the arrow and going clockwise around the figure. The first point is at (-50, 20), the second is (-10, 120), and so on. Then they built that list in Snap<em>!</em> like this:<br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinate-list-for-A.es.png" alt="coordinate-list-for-A" title="coordinate-list-for-A"><br />
                    Now they need a script that will use that list to make the drawing, like this:<br />
