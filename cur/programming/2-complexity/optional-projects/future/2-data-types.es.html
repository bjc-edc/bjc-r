                <li>Comment: This is the kind of thing I wish we could do more often: Present a method as in 2.2.2 and then show the power of a more abstract method (2.2.3). If this becomes a regular feature, I think it will save time overall.  <strong>Sorry:  I meant the transition from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2</strong>.  That's a very good design principle.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>I'm a little confused by what you mean here. 2.2.2 seems like a more abstract version of 2.2.1, but I'm interested in the principle you are explicating. Can you say more? Do we do this anywhere else--as another example? --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>

<!--<p>A <strong>data type</strong> is a label that specifies what type of data a variable can hold. In some programming languages, there are different data types for numbers than for words&mdash;or even for different kinds of numbers (for instance, integers vs. decimals). In Snap<em>!</em>, there are variables (which each hold one piece of data that can be either a number or text) and lists (which hold multiple pieces of data&mdash;numbers or text). We can also create our own data types to help clarify our code.</p>  -->

			<strong>On this page,</strong> you will create an abstract data type <code>point</code> to make your U2L2-DrawShape code easier to read, debug, and use:<br />

            Just as the name suggests, a <strong>data type</strong> is  what type of data something is (number, text string, list, etc.). Each programming language provides some <strong>primitive</strong> (built in) <strong>data types</strong>. Snap<em>!</em> provides numbers, text (words and sentences), lists, Booleans, and some you haven't yet used as data:<br />
            <div class="sidenote">This block's pull-down menu shows all of Snap<em>!</em>'s primitive types.</div>

		<div class="takeNote">
            <p>An <strong>abstract data type</strong> (or <strong>ADT</strong>) is a kind of data that's meaningful to your program but not built into the language. You develop it as you program. <!-- Examples might be &quot;sentence&quot; in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/1-gossip.es.html">Unit 1 Lab 2</a> or &quot;angle&quot; in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/1-exploring-motion.es.html">Unit 1 Lab 3</a>. --> </p>
            <p>
                For example in this lab, you'll create a <em>point</em> data type with:
                <ul>
                    <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point()().es.png" alt="point()()" title="point()()"> to <em>construct</em> the ADT</li>
                    <li> <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/xcoordinateof.es.png" height="35" alt="x coordinate of ()" title="x coordinate of ()"> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/ycoordinateof.es.png" height="35" alt="y coordinate of ()" title="y coordinate of ()"> to <em>select</em> either coordinate of a point</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p>The word "abstract" is often used casually to mean something <em>harder</em> to understand or more complex, but in computer science, its meaning is almost the opposite. ADTs are things that you, the programmer, create to make your program <em>easier</em> for you and others to read, debug, and improve.</p>

			<div class="stagedir">Gamal joins Betsy and Alphie's <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/optional-projects/future/4-the-for-each-block.es.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.es.topic&course=bjc4nyc.es.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Processing Each Item in a List">ongoing discussion from previous page</a> about using a list of coordinates to draw a letter.</div>
        	<div><span>Gamal:</span> I was looking at our <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/go-to-point().es.png" alt="go-to-point()" title="go-to-point()"> block and thought of a way to make it much easier to read.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Yeah, expressions like <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/item2ofpoint.es.png" height="40" alt="item(2)of-point" title="item(2)of-point" />  are hard to read. Even after I wrote it to find the <em>y</em> coordinate, I had to think twice to understand it.</div>
            <div class="sidenote">Gamal is suggesting <strong>data abstraction</strong>: creating a new ADT to hide the details. When using the <code>point</code> ADT, you won't have to think about how points are represented as lists.</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> That's what I mean. <!--The <code>item</code> <var>2</var> <code>of</code> block gives us a number—the <em>y</em>-coordinate—if  its input is a point, but gives us a <em>point</em>—a list of two numbers—if its input is a list of points.--> Let's make it clearer. We can define a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/ycoordinateofpoint.es.png" alt="y coordinate of (point)" title="y coordinate of (point)"> block to use instead of <code>item 2 of</code> <!--<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/item2ofpoint.es.png" alt="item(2)-of-(point)" title="item(2)-of-(point)">-->.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> But that block would do just the same thing as <code>item 2 of</code>, so what's the use?  It won't make the program  shorter.</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> Yes, but it'll make the program easier to read and <em>easier to think about</em>. We can use <code>x coordinate</code> and <code>y coordinate</code> instead of <code>item of</code> as inputs to the <code>go to</code><!-- <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y.es.png" alt="go to x: y:">--> block.</div>
            <div class="stagedir">
                They build two blocks: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/xcor.es.png" alt="x coordinate of (point){report item 1 of (point)}" title="x coordinate of (point){report item 1 of (point)}"> and

            </div>
            <div> <span>Betsy:</span> Hmmm... And if we make a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point()().es.png" alt="point () ()" title="point () ()" /> block, then we can write <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point-list-for-A.es.png" height="80" alt="list{point(-50)(20), point(-10)(120),...point(-30)(20)}" title="list{point(-50)(20), point(-10)(120),...point(-30)(20)}"> instead of <img height="56" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinate-list-for-A.es.png"  alt="list{list(-50)(20), list(-10)(120),...list(-30)(20)}" title="list{list(-50)(20), list(-10)(120),...list(-30)(20)}">. That would make it clearer what this list really is. </div>

            <div class="endnote">
                Don't type the <code>#</code> symbol in the <code>point</code> block's input names.
