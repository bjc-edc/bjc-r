		<h2>Making Computers Do Math</h2>
        <div class="todo">So, I cleaned up this page, but I had a "so what?" feeling at the end. These feel like random tasks your teacher makes you do that go nowhere. At first, I thought to offer some interesting and fun mathematical explorations that could be made much easier with these blocks, but then I thought to look back at my <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=mfries&ProjectName=standard%20algorithms&editMode" title="standard algorithms" target="_blank">standard algorithms</a> collection. I'm having the same problem here as I did with <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/5-sentence-builder.html" title="Modeling Language">Modeling Language</a> in U1--why this? why here? It feels like the thing we say we shouldn't do: writing something in because someone likes it. I know this isn't quite that because 1) we are agreed that we want more contextual variety and 2) we are agreed that we want more FP examples, but I there is work to do to address (1) without feeling arbitrary and pointless and (2) to explicitly discuss FP as much as we want to. --MF, 9/12/18

                            <strong>Debug:</strong> One of these will be inconsistent with the others. To fix the problem, you'll need to <em>define</em> 0! as 1. Edit your factorial block to report 1 if <em>n</em> = 0. Then fully test your block again to make sure it works as it should. </li>

                            I cut this because it only happens if their solution is iterative and not recursive, and they have seen recursion at this point, and the language above ("...5! is really just 5 times 4!") hints at recursion. --MF, 9/11/18

                                <strong>Analyzing code: </strong>In mathematics, factorial is defined only for positive integers and zero, so 3.7! would make no mathematical sense.

                <div class="todo">I stopped here. I don't know what the point of this next problem is, so it's hard to know how to write it. I would do this by actually finding the divisors and then running <code>length</code> on that list. I guess you could run a counter through the process instead of storing the divisors, but that avoids building another useful block that's trivial to add to the effort. <strong>WHY THIS?</strong> --MF, 9/12/18</div>

                <strong>Counting divisors: </strong>Create a block that takes a whole number as input and checks  numbers from 1 through that input and counts the ones that evenly divide the input. So, for example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/number-of-divisors-of-8-with-result(4).png" alt="number of divisors of 8, with result = 4"> because, from 1 through 8, only the numbers 1, 2, 4, and 8 evenly divide 8.  <code>number-of-divisors 10</code> should also report 4 because, of the numbers from 1 through 10, only 1, 2, 5, and 10 are divisors of 10. <strong>Experiment</strong> to find several numbers that have an odd number of divisors.</li>

                    <strong>Old-fashioned divisibility test—divisibility by 3 or 9: </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a helper reporter <code>digit sum</code> that adds up the digits in a number.  So, for example <code>digit sum 7</code> should report 7, and <code>digit sum 12</code> should report 3, and <code>digit sum 126</code> should report 9 (the sum of 1, 2 and 6).  You may find these blocks useful. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/letter-i-of-number.png" alt="fletter-i-of-number"> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/for-i=1-to-length-of-number.png" alt="for-i=1-to-length-of-number"></li>
                        <li>Then write <code>repeated digit sum</code>, which keeps taking the <code>digit sum</code> until the result is a single digit. For example, the digit sum of 238 is 2+3+8=13, which is more than a single digit. The digit sum of 13 is 1+3=4, which <em>is</em> a single digit. So the repeated digit sum of 238 is 4.</li>
                        <li>
                            Write predicates <code>divisible by 3?</code> and <code>divisible by 9?</code>. A number is divisible by 3 if its repeated digit sum is 0, 3, 6, or 9; it's divisible by 9 if its digit sum is 0 or 9.
