                    <strong>Old-fashioned divisibility test—divisibility by 3 or 9: </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a helper reporter <code>digit sum</code> that adds up the digits in a number.  So, for example <code>digit sum 7</code> should report 7, and <code>digit sum 12</code> should report 3, and <code>digit sum 126</code> should report 9 (the sum of 1, 2 and 6).  You may find these blocks useful. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/letter-i-of-number.png" alt="fletter-i-of-number"> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/for-i=1-to-length-of-number.png" alt="for-i=1-to-length-of-number"></li>
                        <li>Then write <code>repeated digit sum</code>, which keeps taking the <code>digit sum</code> until the result is a single digit. For example, the digit sum of 238 is 2+3+8=13, which is more than a single digit. The digit sum of 13 is 1+3=4, which <em>is</em> a single digit. So the repeated digit sum of 238 is 4.</li>
                        <li>
                            Write predicates <code>divisible by 3?</code> and <code>divisible by 9?</code>. A number is divisible by 3 if its repeated digit sum is 0, 3, 6, or 9; it's divisible by 9 if its digit sum is 0 or 9.
