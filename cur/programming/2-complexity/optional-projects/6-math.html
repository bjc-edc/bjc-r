		<h2>Making Computers Do Math</h2>
        <div class="todo">So, I cleaned up this page, but I had a "so what?" feeling at the end. These feel like random tasks your teacher makes you do that go nowhere. At first, I thought to offer some interesting and fun mathematical explorations that could be made much easier with these blocks, but then I thought to look back at my <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=mfries&ProjectName=standard%20algorithms&editMode" title="standard algorithms" target="_blank">standard algorithms</a> collection. I'm having the same problem here as I did with <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/5-sentence-builder.html" title="Modeling Language">Modeling Language</a> in U1--why this? why here? It feels like the thing we say we shouldn't do: writing something in because someone likes it. I know this isn't quite that because 1) we are agreed that we want more contextual variety and 2) we are agreed that we want more FP examples, but I there is work to do to address (1) without feeling arbitrary and pointless and (2) to explicitly discuss FP as much as we want to. --MF, 9/12/18

                            <strong>Debug:</strong> One of these will be inconsistent with the others. To fix the problem, you'll need to <em>define</em> 0! as 1. Edit your factorial block to report 1 if <em>n</em> = 0. Then fully test your block again to make sure it works as it should. </li>

                            I cut this because it only happens if their solution is iterative and not recursive, and they have seen recursion at this point, and the language above ("...5! is really just 5 times 4!") hints at recursion. --MF, 9/11/18

                                <strong>Analyzing code: </strong>In mathematics, factorial is defined only for positive integers and zero, so 3.7! would make no mathematical sense.

                                Find out what it reports and analyze what the block does so that you can figure out why <em>that</em> is the result.

                <div class="todo">I stopped here. I don't know what the point of this next problem is, so it's hard to know how to write it. I would do this by actually finding the divisors and then running <code>length</code> on that list. I guess you could run a counter through the process instead of storing the divisors, but that avoids building another useful block that's trivial to add to the effort. <strong>WHY THIS?</strong> --MF, 9/12/18</div>

                <strong>Counting divisors: </strong>Create a block that takes a whole number as input and checks  numbers from 1 through that input and counts the ones that evenly divide the input. So, for example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/number-of-divisors-of-8-with-result(4).png" alt="number of divisors of 8, with result = 4"> because, from 1 through 8, only the numbers 1, 2, 4, and 8 evenly divide 8.  <code>number-of-divisors 10</code> should also report 4 because, of the numbers from 1 through 10, only 1, 2, 5, and 10 are divisors of 10. <strong>Experiment</strong> to find several numbers that have an odd number of divisors.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a helper reporter <code>digit sum</code> that adds up the digits in a number.  So, for example <code>digit sum 7</code> should report 7, and <code>digit sum 12</code> should report 3, and <code>digit sum 126</code> should report 9 (the sum of 1, 2 and 6).  You may find these blocks useful. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/letter-i-of-number.png" alt="fletter-i-of-number"> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/for-i=1-to-length-of-number.png" alt="for-i=1-to-length-of-number"></li>
                        <li>Then write <code>repeated digit sum</code>, which keeps taking the <code>digit sum</code> until the result is a single digit. For example, the digit sum of 238 is 2+3+8=13, which is more than a single digit. The digit sum of 13 is 1+3=4, which <em>is</em> a single digit. So the repeated digit sum of 238 is 4.</li>
                        <li>
                            Write predicates <code>divisible by 3?</code> and <code>divisible by 9?</code>. A number is divisible by 3 if its repeated digit sum is 0, 3, 6, or 9; it's divisible by 9 if its digit sum is 0 or 9.
