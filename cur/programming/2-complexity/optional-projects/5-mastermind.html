                <h2>Mastermind</h2>

        <div class="learn">
        	<strong>In this project,</strong> you will build the framework for the game of Mastermind&#8482;. In this game, one player makes up a secret sequence of four colors and the other player tries to guess it. (In a real game, both players make up secret sequences and take turns trying to guess. We are simplifying the game by implementing only one side; when the game is finished, you can extend it to have both directions play at once.)<br />

            <ol>
                <li>Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/mastermind-starter.xml">this starter project</a>. We have given you six sprites, two to show the colors of a guess and two to show the feedback to the guesser: How many colors are in the correct positions, and how many correct colors are in incorrect positions. The first sprite has two short scripts, one to be used at the beginning of the game, and the other to be used when a guess is made.</li>
                <li>
                    Play a game of Mastermind with your partner, not on the computer but on paper. Here are the rules:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each player should write down a sequence of four colors without letting your partner see it.  For convenience you can use the first letter of each color name to represent that color: <strong>r</strong>ed, <strong>o</strong>range, <strong>y</strong>ellow, <strong>g</strong>reen, <strong>b</strong>lue, <strong>v</strong>iolet. Don't use the same color more than once.</li>
                        <li>Take turns guessing your partner's colors. When your partner makes a guess about your colors, you give two numbers as feedback: How many colors are in the correct position, and how many colors are correct, but in incorrect positions. For example, if your secret colors are <strong>royg</strong> and your partner guesses<strong> goby</strong> you reply "one and two," because orange is in the correct position, and yellow and green are in the guess but not in the correct position. Blue isn't in your secret colors at all.</li>
                        <li>Try to make good guesses based on the information you already have from earlier guesses. For example, after <strong>goby</strong> in the example above, you might think "one of my colors is in the correct position, and two other colors are correct. I'm going to guess that green is in the correct position, and orange and blue are in the list someplace. So my next guess should be <strong>grob</strong> because that has green in the same place as before, and orange and blue moved over." Your partner will reply "zero and three," which sounds like negative progress, but it isn't, because now you know for sure that green isn't the correct-position color, so on your next guess you'll try orange in the second position, and so on.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    You're going to build the Mastermind program in stages, over the course of the year. Right now your only goal is to support two human players by using the computer as a notepad for guesses and feedback:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find out the two players' names so you can use them to keep track of whose turn it is.</li>
                        <li>Ask one player to make a guess (using four letters like <strong>goby</strong> above), and display that guess on the screen.</li>
                        <li>Ask the other player for feedback, as two numbers.</li>
                        <li>Keep doing that until the guesser gets the correct answer.</li>
                    </ul>

                        Note: You'll find it useful for a script to be able to tell a particular sprite what to do.  There's a tool to do that:
                        <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/tell.png" alt="tell (sprite) to (action)"><br />
                        For example:<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/tell-alonzo.png" width="236" height="82" alt="tell (Alonzo) to (say ...)"><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/tell-correct.png" width="231" height="83" alt="tell (correct position) to (show value (# correct))">
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><div class="saveAs"><span class="text">"U1L6-Mastermind"</span><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-this-as.png" alt="save your work as U1L6-Mastermind" title="save your work as U1L6-Mastermind" /></div></li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        
        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Instead of asking the guesser to type in four letters, you could have six color buttons that the guesser could click in order. To do this, make six more sprites, each with a color, and put them off on the side of the stage so they won't be confused with the recorded guesses. You should also have an "erase" sprite with this character as its costume: ⌫ and an "okay" sprite, maybe with a check mark: ✓.  Make sure that these buttons update the display appropriately.</li>
                <li>Let both players have secret color sequences, and take turns guessing each other's list. You'll have to add a second column of guesses toward the right side of the stage, and a second set of sprites. The game ends when either player guesses correctly.</li>
            </ol>
