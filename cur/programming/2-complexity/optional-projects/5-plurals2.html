                        <li>This specialist block should work correctly for words that fit its specialty <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_h-crutch-with-result.png" alt="plural (for words ending with h) with correct  result for the word crutch" title="plural (for words ending with h) with correct  result for the word crutch"> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_h-moth-with-result.png" alt="suffix s (for words ending in h) with result for moth" title="suffix s (for words ending in h) with result for moth">, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_h-bush-with-result.png" alt="plural (for words ending in h) with result" title="plural (for words ending in h) with result">. It can be completely wrong about words that <em>don't</em> fit its specialty <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_h-mouse-with-(wrong)result.png" alt="plural (for words ending with h) with wrong result for mouse (wrong input)" title="plural (for words ending with h) with wrong result for mouse (wrong input)"> because the <code>plural</code> block should never give words to <code>plural-h</code> unless those words end with <strong>h</strong>. </li>
                        <li>Test <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_h.png" alt="plural-h" title="plural-h" > with a variety of words to make sure it works the way you want. Then use <code>map</code> to test it on the entire <code>list</code> you made earlier.</li>

                	<p><strong>Abstraction: </strong> Language often has special cases. In English, the plurals ofsome nouns add  <em>s</em>;  some   add  <em>es</em>;  nouns like <em>calf</em> and <em>fly</em> become <em>calves</em> and <em>flies</em>, changing their final letters before adding <em>es</em>. And more. For a programming task this complex, it's (generally) best to break it into parts, handle each part separately with its own procedure (its own block), and then have the "top-level" block—in this case, <code>plural</code>, itself—use those specialists. That is, instead of coding every little detail directly in <code>plural</code>, it is cleaner and clearer to make <code>plural</code> look something like this.</p>
                  <p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-abstract-definition.png" alt="abstract definition of plural: if h = last letter of word, report h-case plural; if y = last letter of word, report y-case plural; if some other case, use a block that specializes in that case; etc.; else report join word s" title="abstract definition of plural: if h = last letter of word, report h-case plural; if y = last letter of word, report y-case plural; if some other case, use a block that specializes in that case; etc.; else report join word s"></p>
                    <p>Showing<a name="abstraction" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>the <em>structure</em> of the method—just the overall strategy—in the "top-level" block and leaving the details to  separate blocks is one part of an important computer science idea called <strong>abstraction</strong>. Abstraction keeps your code clear, readable, and more easily debugged. It will also help your code be more flexible. </p>
				</div>
				<li> When you trust your new specialist block, edit <code> plural</code> to use the specialist. Test (you can use <code>map</code>) to make sure <code>plural</code> still works for all the words it used to work for, as well as the new ones.</li>
				<li> Create <code>plural-y</code> to handle words like 
					<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_y-tray-with-result.png"  alt="plural_y-tray-with-result" title="plural_y-tray-with-result"> and
					<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_y-sky-with-result.png" alt="plural_y-sky-with-result" title="plural_y-sky-with-result">
				</li>
				<p>Remember, any specialist can make mistakes if it's asked to do a job that isn't its  specialty. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_y-mouse-with-(wrong)result.png" alt="plural_y-mouse-with-(wrong)result" title="plural_y-mouse-with-(wrong)result"> </p>
				<p>Make sure  <code>plural</code> gives it only the job it knows how to handle correctly.</p>

            <ol type="A"> 
                <li>Because you know what  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/keep-items-such-that-(last-letter-of-(input)-equals-h)-from-test-list.png" alt="keep-items-such-that-(last-letter-of-(input)-equals-h)-from-test-list" title="keep-items-such-that-(last-letter-of-(input)-equals-h)-from-test-list"> does, you can, if you like, use just <em>that</em> specialized list as input to a test of plural or plural-h, this way.<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/map-plural(with-input)-over-(keep-items-such-that-(last-letter-of-(input)-equals-h)-from-test-list).png" alt="map-plural(with-input)-over-(keep-items-such-that-(last-letter-of-(input)-equals-h)-from-test-list)" title="map-plural(with-input)-over-(keep-items-such-that-(last-letter-of-(input)-equals-h)-from-test-list)"></li>
                <li>Extend <code>plural</code> to handle another special case. Use a special-purpose block for your special case to  keep <code>plural</code> from becoming cluttered.</li>
                <li>Right now, if <code>plural</code> is given a word with a space at the end, it leaves that space in the plural, like this: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[space]-with-result(bulldog[space]s).png" alt="plural of bulldog with space at the end, and result with space before s" title="plural of bulldog with space at the end, and result with space before s">. Figure out how to handle this special case and edit <code>plural</code> so that the result is <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[space]-with-result(bulldogs).png" alt="plural of bulldog with space at the end, and correct result, no space before s" title="plural of bulldog with space at the end, and correct result, no space before s">. You  already have a block that <em>specializes</em> in making plurals of words that <em>don't</em> have a space at the end. <em>Use</em> it.</li>
                <li><strong>Surprise!</strong> Once <code>plural</code> works for a single space at the end of a word, try giving it <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[four-spaces].png" alt="plural of bulldog with four spaces at the end" title="plural of bulldog with four spaces at the end">. That works!! But why?!</li>
