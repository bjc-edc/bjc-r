                    <p><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Language often has special cases. In English, the plurals of some nouns add  "s";  some add "es"; nouns like "calf" and "fly" become "calves" and "flies", changing their final letters before adding "es". And more. For a programming task this complex, it's (generally) best to break it into parts, handle each part separately with its own procedure (its own block), and then have the "top-level" block—in this case, <code>plural</code>, itself—use those specialists. That is, instead of coding every little detail directly in <code>plural</code>, it is cleaner and clearer to make <code>plural</code> look something like this.<br />
                        <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-abstract-definition.png" alt="abstract definition of plural: if h = last letter of word, report h-case plural; if y = last letter of word, report y-case plural; if some other case, use a block that specializes in that case; etc.; else report join word s" title="abstract definition of plural: if h = last letter of word, report h-case plural; if y = last letter of word, report y-case plural; if some other case, use a block that specializes in that case; etc.; else report join word s"></p>
                    <p>Showing<a name="abstraction" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>the <em>structure</em> of the method—just the overall strategy—in the "top-level" block and leaving the details to  separate blocks is one part of an important computer science idea called <em>abstraction</em>. Abstraction keeps your code clear, readable, and more easily debugged. It will also help your code be more flexible. </p>
				</div>
				<li> When you trust your new specialist block, edit <code> plural</code> to use the specialist. Test (you can use <code>map</code>) to make sure <code>plural</code> still works for all the words it used to work for, as well as the new ones.</li>
				<li> Create <code>plural-y</code> to handle words like
					<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_y-tray-with-result.png"  alt="plural-y (tray) reporting 'trays'" title="plural-y (tray) reporting 'trays'"> and
					<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_y-sky-with-result.png" alt="plural-y (sky) reporting 'skies'" title="plural-y (sky) reporting 'skies'">
				</li>
				<div class="endnote">
                    Remember, any specialist can make mistakes if it's asked to do a job that isn't its specialty. For example:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural_y-mouse-with-(wrong)result.png" alt="plural-y (mouse) reporting 'mousies'" title="plural-y (mouse) reporting 'mousies'"><br />
                    Make sure <code>plural</code> gives <code>plural-y</code> only words it knows how to handle correctly.

                            You  already have a block that <em>specializes</em> in making plurals of words that <em>don't</em> have a space at the end. <em>Use</em> it.

                    Does your <code>plurals</code> block still feel cluttered, even though the details about how to handle each possible last letter are abstracted into specialist blocks?  One way to improve on this situation is to use another kind of abstraction called <em>data-directed programming.</em>

                            Start by making a list of <em>key-value pairs</em>, with last letters as the keys and specialist procedures as the values:<br />

                            <div class="narrowpurple">To make the second item of each small list, find the block you want, put it in the second input to <code>list</code>, then right-click on the block and choose "ringify."  As the "x" example shows, it doesn't have to be a block named <code>plural-</code>something.  It just has to have an empty input slot where you want the word to go.</div>

                                <div class="todo">We haven't taught FIND FIRST yet. So I looked at <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/3-tic-tac-toe/3-checking-for-ties.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">3.3.3</a> where we first use it, and we don't teach it there either. :/ We actually teach it in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/3-turning-data-information/4-filtering-data.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">5.3.4</a>.

When you drag <code>item 2 of pair</code> into that slot, the ring remains around it.  That's usually what we want when using <code>call</code>, but not this time.  Right-click on the <code>item of</code> block and choose "unringify" from the menu.</p>
                                <div class="endnote">You can experiment with <code>call</code> to see what else you can do with it.  What happens if you don't unringify the <code>item</code> block?  What happens if you leave out the "<code>with inputs</code>" and the second input?</div>

                            There's no reason the keys have to be single letters.  Modify the code in <code>plural</code> so that it tests all <em>trailing substrings</em> of the word against the specialist list.  That is, if the word is "ditch,"  you'd look in the specialist list for "ditch," then for "itch," then "tch," "ch," and finally, if nothing else is found, "h."  You'd put<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/ch-dispatch.png" alt="list (ch) (ringed block (join ( ) (es)))" title="list (ch) (ringed block (join ( ) (es)))" /><br />
                            in the list, and then words ending "ch" would have "es" added.  This mechanism is very general; it works even for special cases such as<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/child-dispatch.png" alt="list (child) (ringified (word (children)))" title="list (child) (ringified (word (children)))" /><br />
                            (You'll have to define the <code>word</code> function that just reports its input; it's needed because you can't type letters directly into a ring.)  <em>Now</em> you have a <em>really</em> uncluttered <code>plural</code> block.  And it'll even work for a language other than English, if you make a different specialist list.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div class="comment">Here is where you really start to lose me. I'm not actually building this in Snap<em>!</em>now, as I've spent far too long on this already, but the text doesn't explain this adequately for me. --MF, 1/11/21</div>
                            If you modify the trailing-substring test so that instead of giving up if it can't find the last letter of the word as a key, it goes one step further and looks for an <em>empty</em> key in the specialist list, and you add<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/default-dispatch.png" alt="(item ( ) (ringed (join ( ) (s))))" title="(item ( ) (ringed (join ( ) (s))))" /><br />
                            to the list, then you can be sure that every possible word will match that, if nothing else, so you don't need the <code>if</code> any more.  Your <code>plural</code> block can now be just one-line: <code>report (call (item 2 of (longest trailing substring ...</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For an extra challenge, modify your trailing-substring test so that a plus sign in the key matches any vowel (it will serve as a wild-card character), so you can do this:<br />
