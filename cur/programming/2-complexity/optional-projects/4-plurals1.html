		<h2>Developing a Block That Makes Plurals</h2>
        <div class="learn">Siri and other robots are programmed to  generate  language. Siri speaks; some robots write. You have  developed a program, <code>gossip</code>, that writes. Now, you can extend  the computer's abilities with language by developing a reporter block, <code>plural</code>, that takes a noun as input and correctly spells and outputs the plural. <br /> 
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-day-with-result.png" alt="plural day (with result)" title="plural day (with result)" />
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-boss-with-result.png" alt="plural boss (with result)" title="plural boss (with result)" /> <br /> Spelling a plural can seem almost automatic for a person, but it is not simple: a computer needs an algorithm to do that task.</div>

        	<div class="sidenote">This project uses  blocks  already loaded for you from Snap<em>!</em>'s &quot;Words, sentences&quot; library. You can load a library   from the File menu <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button"/> under "Libraries...".</div>
    <ol>
        <li>To do this project, you will need to use the new blocks   <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/last-letter-of-169x27.png" alt="last letter of" title="last letter of" />, and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/all-but-last-letter-of-231x27 pixels.png" alt="all but last letter of" title="all but last letter of" />. You will also need<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/(list-of-items)-contains-(some-item)-predicate.png"  alt="(list-of-items)-contains-(some-item)-predicate"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/join-117x27.png" alt="join" title="join" />, which you used in Unit 1 Lab 2, Gossip and Greet. Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2-project-plural.xml">this starter project</a>. Try all its expressions (the one-line scripts) and experiment with their inputs until you understand them well enough.</li>

        		<li> <strong>Debugging: </strong> Try  to find words for which this version of <code>plural</code> does <em>not</em>  work correctly. List  the words you find. <em>Organize that list</em>, sorting the words into categories according to their last letter.

					<p><strong>Debugging: </strong>To write good code that works, you want to try to "break"  it,  to find situations in which it does <em>not</em> work. This requires thinking of wild and exceptional cases, even including inputs that are incorrect in some way, like this example, which has a space at the end. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[space]-with-result(bulldog[space]s).png" alt="plural of a word with a space following the word" title="plural of a word with a space following the word" /></p>

                    <p> Edit your <code>plural</code> block to make it work for words that end with x. <em>Test</em> it to make sure it does work properly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Use <code>map</code> to test <em>all</em> the words on your list. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/map-plural-over-list-of-nouns.png"  alt="map-plural-over-list-of-nouns">
                  <p>For now, don't worry about the words it still gets wrong, as long as it still works for "day," "boss," "medicine," "box."</p></li>
