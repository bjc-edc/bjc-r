		<h2>Modeling Language</h2>
        <div class="learn">Siri and other robots are programmed to  generate  language. Siri speaks; some robots write. You have  developed a program, <code>gossip</code>, that writes. Now, you can extend  the computer's abilities with language by developing a reporter block, <code>plural</code>, that takes a noun as input and correctly spells and outputs the plural. <br /> 
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-day-with-result.png" alt="plural day (with result)" title="plural day (with result)" />
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-boss-with-result.png" alt="plural boss (with result)" title="plural boss (with result)" /> <br /> Spelling a plural can seem almost automatic for a person, but it is not simple: a computer needs an algorithm to do that task.</div>
        
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first"> 
        	<div class="sidenote">This project uses  blocks  already loaded for you from Snap<em>!</em>'s &quot;Words, sentences&quot; library. You can load a library   from the File menu <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button"/> under "Libraries...".</div>
    <ol>
        <li>To do this project, you will need to use the new blocks   <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/last-letter-of-169x27.png" alt="last letter of" title="last letter of" />, and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/all-but-last-letter-of-231x27 pixels.png" alt="all but last letter of" title="all but last letter of" />. You will also need<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/(list-of-items)-contains-(some-item)-predicate.png"  alt="(list-of-items)-contains-(some-item)-predicate"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/join-117x27.png" alt="join" title="join" />, which you used in Unit 1 Lab 2, Gossip and Greet. Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2-project-plural.xml">this starter project</a>. Try all its expressions (the nine one-line scripts) and experiment with their inputs until you are sure you understand what they're doing.</li>
        <div class="endnote">You  won't need <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/join-t-all-but-first-letter-of-when-343x33.png" style="height:2.6em;" alt="join-(t)-all-but-first-letter-of-when" title="join-(t)-all-but-first-letter-of-when" /> this for the project, but you might find it interesting to try it not only with "when," as an input but with "where,"  "what,"  "wherefore." Linguists use evidence like this to understand the history of a language.</div>
        		<div class="sidenote">
            Choose the <em>reporter</em> button when you make  <code>plural</code>.
<p> <img src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/make-a-reporter.png" alt="select reporter as block type" title="select reporter as block type" /> </p> </div>
            <li>Here's one way to start building the <code>plural</code> block. Build this much and test it out on at least "day" and "boss" and "medicine," to make sure it works correctly for those. If it does not, edit and fix it. <br \> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-(script).png"  alt="plural-(script), first try" title="plural-(script), first try" /></li>
    
 
        		<li> <strong>Debugging: </strong> Try  to find words for which this version of <code>plural</code> does <em>not</em>  work correctly. List  the words you find. <em>Organize that list</em>, sorting the words into categories according to their last letter. For example, it will get wrong some  words   that end with the letter <em>h</em>. Try to find many words it gets wrong. </li>
        		<li><strong><em>Save your list.</em></strong> 
                	<ul>
                    	<li>Create a Snap<em>!</em> list like this   <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/noun-list-for-testing-plural2.png"  alt="snap list block containing day, boss, bulldog(with space at end), box, butterfly, brush, and more of your choosing"> containing <em>all</em> of your words.</li>

					<p><strong>Debugging: </strong>To write  code that works, you want to try to find situations in which it does <em>not</em> work. &quot;Breaking it&quot; requires thinking of wild and exceptional cases, even including inputs that are incorrect in some way, like this example, which has a space at the end. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[space]-with-result(bulldog[space]s).png" alt="plural of a word with a space following the word" title="plural of a word with a space following the word" /></p>

                <li> 
                	<code>plural</code> should now work correctly for "day" and "boss" and "medicine," but it probably doesn't yet work correctly for the word "box"

                    <p> Edit your <code>plural</code> block to make it work for words that end with x. <em>Test</em> it to make sure it does work properly.</p>

                  <p>You can do the same for conjugating verbs in Spanish or some other language you choose. See the Take It Further section at the bottom.</p>
<p>The next two steps are worth learning—very useful for <em>testing</em> <code>plural</code> and in more advanced work later on—but not essential for <em>building</em> <code>plural</code>.</p>

                  <li>Use <code>map</code> to test <em>all</em> the words on your list. The  slot in <code>plural</code> should be left empty, as you see here.

                    <p>For now, don't worry about the words it still gets wrong, as long as it  works for "day," "boss," "medicine," and "box."</p></li>
