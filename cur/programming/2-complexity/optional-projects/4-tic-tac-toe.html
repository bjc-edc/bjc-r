        <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe Using Sprites</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/Three States of TTT.png" width="600"  alt="Three states of Tic Tac Toe: in progress, win, tie" title="Three states of Tic Tac Toe: in progress, win, tie"/><br />
            <p><strong>In this <em>yearlong</em> project,</strong> you will begin developing a program that plays Tic-Tac-Toe as well as you do.</p>
            <p><strong>On this first page,</strong> you display a Tic-Tac-Toe board and let two human players enter moves.</p>
        </div>
        <p>In <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-abstraction/4-building-tic-tac-toe.html">the Tic-Tac-Toe page in U2L4</a>, you wrote a one-sprite program that figured out which square you're moving into by carrying out a computation based on the sprite's position when dropped on the board.</p>
        <p>A different approach to this problem uses <em>parallelism</em> and <em>multiple sprites</em> to make an &quot;active&quot; Tic-Tac-Toe board, in which each square is actually a separate sprite. Each sprite knows which square it's in, because once the board is set up, the sprites never move. You click in a square, and the sprite that you clicked on changes its costume to display the move.  It doesn't have to compute exactly where you clicked.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
          <!--      <li>Play with <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/new/6b-newTTT-phase1-interactive.html" target="_blank">this example</a> to get a feel for the Phase 1 version of Tic Tac Toe. </li>   -->
                <li>
                    Open this <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2-TTT-starter.xml" target="_blank">starter project</a>.  A sprite  has already been created for you with three costumes: Empty, X, and O.<br />

                    Click on the <code>next costume</code> block at the top of the scripting area a few times to see all of them.
              </li>
                <li>
               	You will be using the <strong>clone</strong> feature in Snap<em>!</em> to create the 3&times;3 Tic-Tac-Toe board. A clone is just a copy of an existing sprite, made under control of your program.<br />
                <div class="endnote">Why "under control of your program"?  It's possible to make a copy of a sprite by hand; right-click on the sprite's icon in the sprite corral and choose "Duplicate."  That's useful if you only want one copy, but in this project you're going to need <em>nine</em> copies, one for each square of the Tic-Tac-Toe board. So you'd like to say something along the lines of<br /><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/9-copies.png" alt="repeat 9 [create a clone of myself]"><br />
                The actual code in the project is slightly more than this, but this is the central idea.</div>
                A clone is a complete copy of the sprite you say to copy.  It has the same position, costumes, scripts, and so on.  But...<ul><li>The clone doesn't appear in the sprite corral.</li>
                <li>Once you've made the clone, any changes you make <em>later</em>  to the original sprite (such as adding or modifying a script) is <em>not</em> copied to the clone.</li>
                <li>Clones are <em>temporary.</em>  Clicking the stop button will delete all clones in the project.</li></ul>So the idea is that you write your program completely, then make whatever clones you need.
                </li>
                <li> In the starter project is this demonstration 
                	script:<br />
                	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/WhenIamClicked.png" height="200" alt="when I am clicked, create a clone of myself, glide (1) secs to x: (random...) y: (random...)" title="when I am clicked, create a clone of myself, glide (1) secs to x: (random...) y: (random...)"><br />
                    You're going to use this script <em>right now</em> to learn more about clones, but it isn't going to be part of <em>the finished project.</em>  <em><strong>Read</strong></em> the script together with your partner and talk over what you think will happen when you click on the sprite. Then click on the sprite  on the stage and compare what happens with what you expected.
	                <div class="narrower">				
                    	<ul>
                        	<li>Notice that it is the clicked sprite that moves to a new random position after cloning itself. (You can tell because it's the one that says &quot;You clicked me.&quot;)
                            <!--<div class="todo"> The text says "original" above.  I think that makes things clearest, even though technically it's not necessarily true, since you can also click on a clone once you have some.  The script used to <code>say</code> "I'm the original" but Mary objected because of that technical point.  But in light of Al's complaint that he wasn't sure which was the original, I'm inclined to go back to "I'm the original" in the script.  Thoughts?  --bh</div>--></li>
                    		<li>Note that both copies are <em>active</em> sprites.  Both are clickable (try it) and draggable (try that too).</li>
                            <!--<li>The <code>next costume</code> block chooses each of the three costumes in turn: empty, X, O, empty, ...</li>-->
                            <li>The <code>create a clone</code> block takes an input because it can copy <em>any</em> sprite, but in this project there's only one sprite so you can use <code>myself</code> or <code>Square</code> as the input.</li>
                      </ul>
         </div>

            </ol>

        <p>
            The next script in the starter project is this:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/delete-clone.png" alt="when flag clicked, delete this clone"><br />
            The block is called <code>delete this clone</code> rather than <code>delete this sprite</code> because it works only for clones.  So when you click the green flag, the original sprite and all its clones will run the script, but only the clones will be deleted.  There will then be one sprite left on the stage.
        (Clicking the stop sign automatically deletes clones, but this script is insurance in case you run the program and then run it again without clicking stop first.)</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
    		<ol start="4">
              <li>
                	Delete the <code>when I am clicked</code> script from problem 3.  It was just for demonstration, and shouldn't be in the actual project. (You'll make your own different one soon.)  
                	Also, at the bottom of the scripting area, there's an additional <code>when flag clicked</code> block near, but separate from, the script just below it. They're separated because this script isn't part of the demonstration in problem 2, but it <em>is</em> part of the Tic-Tac-Toe game, so click the two pieces together now.

                            <li>The <code>wait</code> block is needed to ensure that the <em>other</em> <code>when flag clicked</code> script has time to delete old clones before we make new ones.</li>
                            <li><code>makeBoard</code> is an empty script.  You're going to write it in the next problem.</li>

When alternating between two values, it's convenient to use <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> because you can use <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/setXsturn.png" height="50" alt="set X's turn? to (not X's turn?)" title="set X's turn? to (not X's turn?)"> to switch between them, and just<br />

        <div class="todo">ST-The text below is added to prepare kids to the unified approach to TTT.</div>
        <p>In preparation for the next phases of the Tic-Tac-Toe (first computer checking for a win or a tie and then the computer learning to be an intelligent player) you will need to keep track of each move and have access to each Square sprite to be able to tell it to change its costume.  </p>

<div class="forYouToDo" >
<ol start="7">

	<li>Create a global variable <var>Squares List</var> and initialize it to an empty list.  Each Square sprite clone will be added to this list as it is created.<br />
 <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/SquaresListInitialize.png"  height="45" alt=""/></li>

<li>Create a variable <var>id</var> for the Square sprite and select “for this sprite only” option.  This will ensure that every one of the nine clones will get its own unique ID number which it can report when needed.<br />
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/idforthisspriteonly.png" height="150" alt=""/>
        </li>

<li>Add each clone to the <var>Squares List</var> and assign it an ID number as soon as it is created.  This ID will be handy when in the last phase of Tic-Tac-Toe, the computer will anticipate a winning move and will need to access a particular Square sprite to  tell it to change its costume accordingly.<br />
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/setCloneID.png" height="125" alt=""/>
</li>

<li>Test that the ID’s are assigned as expected by having each clone say it’s ID for a second when it is clicked.  The ID’s should be in the following order.<br />
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/SquareNumbersonTTT.png" height="150" alt=""/>
</li>
<li>Create a global variable <var> board</var> and initialize it as shown below.  <br />
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/BoardInitialize.png"  height="70" alt=""/><br />
The <var> board</var> will record the current state of the board as the game is being played.  In the last phase of Tic-Tac-Toe, the <var> board</var> will allow the computer to simulate particular moves to see if they lead to a win without altering the actual board. The computer “anticipating” or “imagining” a winning move is what will make it intelligent.<br />
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/Board.png" height="250" alt=""/>
</li>
<li>After each legal move, set the corresponding item of the <var> board</var> to either X or O. <br />
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/replaceBoarditemwithX.png" height="45" alt=""/>
</li>

Now you are ready for the next phases of the Tic-Tac-Toe where you will use the <var> board</var> to test for a win or a tie and eventually use it to anticipate a winning move.
