            <p><strong>In this <em>yearlong</em> project,</strong> you will begin developing a program that plays Tic-Tac-Toe as well as you do.</p>
            <p><strong>On this first page,</strong> you display a Tic-Tac-Toe board and let two human players enter moves.</p>

          <!--      <li>Play with <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/new/6b-newTTT-phase1-interactive.html" target="_blank">this example</a> to get a feel for the Phase 1 version of Tic Tac Toe. </li>   -->
                <li>
                    Open this <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2-TTT-starter.xml" target="_blank">starter project</a>.  A sprite  has already been created for you with three costumes: Empty, X, and O.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/Costumes.png"  height="100" alt="Costumes of a square: Empty, X and O" title="Costumes of a square: Empty, X and O"/>
                </li>
                <li>
                	You will be using the <strong>clone</strong> feature in Snap<em>!</em> to create the 3&times;3 Tic-Tac-Toe board. A clone is just a copy of an existing sprite. In the starter project is this demonstration script:<br />
                	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/WhenIamClicked.png" height="200" alt="when I am clicked, create a clone of myself, glide (1) secs to x: (random...) y: (random...)" title="when I am clicked, create a clone of myself, glide (1) secs to x: (random...) y: (random...)"><br />
                    Click on the sprite on the stage and watch what happens.
	<div class="narrower">				
                    	<ul>
                        	<li>Note that it is the original sprite that moves to a new random position after cloning itself.</li>
                    		<li>Note that both copies are <em>active</em> sprites.  Both are clickable (try it) and draggable (try that too).</li>
                            <!--<li>The <code>next costume</code> block chooses each of the three costumes in turn: empty, X, O, empty, ...</li>-->
                            <li>The <code>create a clone</code> block takes an input because it can copy <em>any</em> sprite, but in this project there's only one sprite so you should use <code>myself</code> as the input.</li>
                        </ul>
         </div>           
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeNote">Don't go on until you're sure you understand cloning.  Discuss it with others as needed.</div>
        
        <p>
            The other script in the starter project is this:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/delete-clone.png" alt="when flag clicked, delete this clone"><br />
            The block is called <code>delete this clone</code> rather than <code>delete this sprite</code> because it works only for clones.  So when you click the green flag, the original sprite and all its clones will run the script, but only the clones will be deleted.  There will then be one sprite left on the stage.
        </p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
    		<ol start="3">
              <li>
                	Delete the <code>when I am clicked</code> script.  You'll make your own different one soon.  Also, at the bottom of the scripting area, there's an additional <code>when flag clicked</code> block above but separate from the script just below it.  Click them together.
					<div class="narrower">                
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <code>wait</code> block is needed to ensure that the <em>other</em> <code>when flag clicked</code> script has time to delete old clones before we make new ones.</li>
                            <li><code>makeBoard</code> is an empty script.  You're going to write it in the next problem.</li>
                            <li>The variable <var>X's turn?</var> will be <code>true</code> when it's X's turn to play, or <code>false</code> when it's O's turn.  When alternating between two values, it's convenient to use <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> because you can use <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/setXsturn.png" height="50" alt="set X's turn? to (not X's turn?)" title="set X's turn? to (not X's turn?)"> to switch between them.</li>

                            <li>The costumes are all 50 steps tall and wide.</li>
                            <li>Make sure the clones start out with the empty square costume.</li>
                            <li>After cloning nine times to create the board, <code>hide</code> the original sprite so it does not interfere with the game as a tenth square.  Be sure to <code>show</code> the original sprite before cloning it, so that the clones will be visible.</li>

                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>Now write a <code>when I am clicked</code> script that will allow each clone to put on the proper costume when clicked: X or O depending on whose turn it is. Also think, how should a square behave when it is clicked while already wearing an X or O costume.</li>
