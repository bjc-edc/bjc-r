        <h2>Egyptian Motif</h2>

            <p>Need to rebuild images with plain prototype labels. --MF, 9/26/18</p>

            <p>PG: Islamic art is a great candidate for computer drawing, and the samples in TiF B seem like good ones. I'd prefer to have some good /real/ illustrations. I don't see how the top stuff (everything before TiF B) is Egyptian. Feels like another bow to "some culture" without being genuine. But the project is pretty, so can we give it a learning purpose?</p>
            <p>BH: The obvious way to draw the picture in the pink box is as a decorated hexagon.</p>
            <p>MF: I want to revise this page. Some suggestions added to the page.</p>

            <p>Much Islamic art applies principles of geometry and repeats simple patterns to form complex forms. For example, the Egyptian Motif above has six overlapping rectangles.</p>
            <p><strong>In this project,</strong> you will learn how to extend your <code>pinwheel</code> code from Unit 1 to create such intricate patterns.</p>

            <div class="todo">
                    <p>Why are we giving them the code for these blocks instead of asking that they build and/or import them? I suggest cutting #1 and #2 and merging the first part of #3 into the pink box (I like the #3 images better than those in the pink box anyway). The work starts halfway through problem #3. <strong>I want to revise this page</strong>, but for now I just moved #10 from a solo FYTD into the ITIT box. --MF, 9/26/18</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    In this project, you will repeatedly use rectangles, so first recall how to create a <code>rectangle</code> block. <br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/EgyptianMotif_img/rectangleCode.png" alt="rectangle, width:(width) length:(length){pen down; repeat(2){move(width) steps; turn clockwise (90) degrees; move(length) steps; turn clockwise (90) degrees};pen up}" title="rectangle, width:(width) length:(length){pen down; repeat(2){move(width) steps; turn clockwise (90) degrees; move(length) steps; turn clockwise (90) degrees};pen up}"/>
                    <div class="endnote"> Note the use of <code>pen down</code> and <code>pen up</code> blocks inside the rectangle definition. We don't normally do this but here this is done to simplify the more complex code coming ahead. This will ensure that once a rectangle is drawn, the pen is up and you don’t need to worry about unintended scribbles as your drawing sprite continues moving to execute the rest of the code.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Also recall the <code>pinwheel</code> code you have written in Unit 1.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/EgyptianMotif_img/pinwheelCode.png" alt="pinwheel, branches:(number of branches) size:(size) backup:(backup){repeat(number of branches){move(size) steps; move(-1Xbackup) steps; turn clockwise(360/number of branches) degrees}}" title="pinwheel, branches:(number of branches) size:(size) backup:(backup){repeat(number of branches){move(size) steps; move(-1Xbackup) steps; turn clockwise(360/number of branches) degrees}}" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    In this project, you will replace the <em><strong>pinwheel branches</strong></em> with <em><strong>rectangles</strong></em> as shown below. Note use of color is optional and is used here for clarity.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/EgyptianMotif_img/multiColorPinwheel.png"  height="250" alt="Multicolored pinwheel" title="Multicolored pinwheel"/>
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/EgyptianMotif_img/multiColorPinwheelwithRectangles.png" height="250" alt="Multicolored pinwheel with rectangles" title="Multicolored pinwheel with rectangles"/> <br />
                    Now create a <code>pinwheel with rectangles</code> block. It will have two more inputs <var>width</var> and <var>length</var> for the width and length of the rectangles.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/EgyptianMotif_img/pinwheelWithRectanglesCodeHeader.png"  alt="pinwheel with rectangles, branches:(number of branches) size:(size) backup:(backup) width:(width) length:(length)" title="pinwheel with rectangles, branches:(number of branches) size:(size) backup:(backup) width:(width) length:(length)"/><br />
     Its code will be identical to the <code>pinwheel</code> code except that it has the <code>rectangle</code> block inserted in between the two <code>move</code> blocks that created the pinwheel branches. <br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/EgyptianMotif_img/rectangleInBetween.png"  height="175" alt="move(size) steps; rectangle, width:(width) length:(length); move(-1Xbackup) steps" title="move(size) steps; rectangle, width:(width) length:(length); move(-1Xbackup) steps"/><br />

                </li>
                <li>
                    Now, use the “Variables” menu to make variables that will allow you to vary all aspects of the designs you create and do not forget to initialize these variables right after the <code>when green flag clicked</code> block<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/EgyptianMotif_img/makeVariables.png"  height="175" alt="Make variables: length, width, backup, size, number of branches" title="Make variables: length, width, backup, size, number of branches"/><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/EgyptianMotif_img/initializeVariables.png" alt="Initialize variables" title="Initialize variables"/>
                </li>
                <li>
                	You can turn these variables to alterable sliders by right-clicking on the variable icon that is shown on stage and choosing the “slider” option. And then you can set the minimum and maximum values of a slider as shown.<br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/EgyptianMotif_img/turnToSlider.png" height="150" alt="Turn variables to sliders" title="Turn variables to sliders"/><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/EgyptianMotif_img/sliderMax.png"  height="150" alt="Slider maximum" title="Slider maximum"/><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/EgyptianMotif_img/setSliderMax.png"  height="150" alt="Setting slider maximum" title="Setting slider maximum"/><br />
                    The following should be reasonable values for the minimum and maximum of each variable:<br />
                    <div class="sidenote">You can change these minimum and maximum values as you generate and explore new designs.</div>
                    <table class="indent bordered" summary="table of minimum and maximum values for each variable">

                	Your code needs to make sure that the computer is always on the watch in case any of the variables are changed by the user via the sliders. You can do so with a <code>forever</code> block.<br />

                <li>Once the code is written check to make sure everything works as intended. You may need to position your drawing spite appropriately to make best use of the stage you have. Now move each of your sliders to generate and explore a vast variety of designs inspired by Islamic art.
