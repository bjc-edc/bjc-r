		<p>One well-known maze algorithm is called "Follow the left wall."  The idea is to keep your left hand touching a wall.  If suddenly your left hand isn't touching a wall, there's a corridor to the left, and in order to keep your hand on the left wall, you follow it.  If instead you bump into a wall in front of you, then in order to keep your hand on the left wall you'll have to turn right.  (Draw a sketch if that doesn't make sense to you.)  For many mazes, this simple algorithm will eventually get you to the exit.</p>

		    <li>Does the left wall algorithm work for the maze in the first picture?  If not, can you debug it?</li>
