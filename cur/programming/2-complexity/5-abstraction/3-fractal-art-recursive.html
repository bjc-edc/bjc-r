        <h2>Using Abstraction to Nest Triangles</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will use abstraction to nest your triangle script inside itself as you learn about <em>recursion</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Does all that copying and pasting of triangle scripts feel awkward to you? You know a better way: <em>abstraction</em>. In Unit 1, you used a <code>pinwheel</code> block to implement the similar programs <code>asterisk</code> and <code>polygon</code> rather than copying the code. Here, you can use a block to manage the abstraction too. But in this case, we want the similar code (a smaller triangle) <em>nested inside</em>, so we will actually use the same block inside itself, a process called <em>recursion</em>.</p>

                    Create a <code>nested triangle</code> block that takes one input, <var>size</var>, and only draws the triangle if <var>size</var> &gt; 9. (For now, leave out the code about changing colors.)
