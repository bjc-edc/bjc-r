        <p>The goal now is to build <code>plural</code>, a reporter block that takes a noun as input and outputs the plural of the noun, spelled correctly.  
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-day-with-result.png" alt="plural day (with result)" title="plural day (with result)" />
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-boss-with-result.png" alt="plural boss (with result)" title="plural boss (with result)" /> </p> 
        <div class="sidenote">
            Choose the <em>reporter</em> button when you make the <code>plural</code> block.

        </div>
        <p> Here's one way to start building that block.</p>
        <p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-(script).png"  alt="plural-(script), first try" title="plural-(script), first try" /> </p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
        	<ol start="3">
        		<li>Build this much and test it out on at least "day" and "boss" and "medicine," to make sure it works correctly for those. If it does not, edit and fix it. </li>
        		<li> <strong>Debugging: </strong> Try  to find words for which this version of <code>plural</code> does <em>not</em>  work correctly. List  the words you find. <em>Organize that list</em>, sorting the words into categories according to their last letter. For example, it will get wrong some  words   that end with the letter <em>h</em>. Try to find many words it gets wrong. </li>
        		<li><strong><em>Save your list.</em></strong> 
                	<ul>
                    	<li>Create a Snap<em>!</em> list like this   <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/noun-list-for-testing-plural2.png" alt="snap list block containing day, boss, bulldog(with space at end), box, butterfly, brush, and more of your choosing"> containing <em>all</em> of your words.</li>

					<p><strong>Debugging: </strong>To write good code that works, you want to try to "break"  it,  to find situations in which it does <em>not</em> work. This requires thinking of wild and exceptional cases, even including inputs that are incorrect in some way, like this example, which has a space at the end. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[space]-with-result(bulldog[space]s).png" alt="plural of a word with a space following the word" title="plural of a word with a space following the word" /></p>
				</div>
                <li> 
                	<code>plural</code> should now work correctly for "day" and "boss" and "medicine," but it probably doesn't yet work correctly for the word "box"

                    <p> Edit your <code>plural</code> block to make it work for words that end with x. <em>Test</em> it to make sure it does work properly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Use <code>map</code> to test <em>all</em> the words on your list. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/map-plural-over-list-of-nouns.png"  alt="map-plural-over-list-of-nouns">
                  <p>For now, don't worry about the words it still gets wrong, as long as it still works for "day," "boss," "medicine," "box."</p></li>

                      to see what they do.
