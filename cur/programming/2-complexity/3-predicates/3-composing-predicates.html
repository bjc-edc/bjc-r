			<p>
            	<strong>On this page</strong>, you will combine predicates to find words with multiple characteristics at once.

                    ST-I wonder if we should show them one example -may be even a gif- as they may not understand the point of using "and" to reduce the search space.
                    <br />
                    ST-I think we should have an printable/editable word/excel document of this puzzle so that kids can record their progress on the puzzle itself.  I don't think kids will take the time to redraw the whole puzzle.</div>
