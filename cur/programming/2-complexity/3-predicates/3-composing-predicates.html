			<p>
            	<strong>On this page</strong>, you will combine predicates to find words with multiple characteristics at once.

                	Create and test a predicate block that checks whether a certain letter is in a word. Examples below. Your block should:
					<ul>
						<li>Accept two inputs: a <var>word</var> and a <var>letters</var> to check for, and</li>
                        <li>Report whether or not the inputted word has inputted letter.</li>
