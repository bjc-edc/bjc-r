		<h2>Solving a Word Puzzle</h2>
		<div class="learn">
			<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will solve a crossword puzzle by combining predicates using the <code>and</code> block. You will then use the resulting predicates with <code>keep</code> to find words with specific characteristics.</p>

                    Use your new predicates with the <code>keep</code> block to:

	    			Create and test a predicate block to <strong>check the last letter of a word</strong>. Examples and a suggestion are below. Your block should:
                    <ul>
						<li>Accept two inputs: a <var>letter</var> and a <var>word</var>, and</li>

                	A great way to approach this problem is by using <strong>problem decomposition</strong>: breaking the problem into smaller pieces. For example, you might choose to first build a <code>last letter of</code> reporter that reports the last letter of an inputted word. Then you could solve the problem more easily, like this:<br />
                	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/is-last-letter-of-word-definition.png" alt="is (letter) the last letter of (word)? block definition" title="is (letter) the last letter of (word)? block definition" /><br />
                	Using simpler blocks to define a more complicated block is an example of <em>abstraction</em> as this process hides complexity.
