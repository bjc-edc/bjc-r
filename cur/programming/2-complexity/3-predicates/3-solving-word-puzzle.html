		<h2>Solving a Word Puzzle</h2>

			<p>
            	<strong>On this page</strong>, you will create predicates that check words for a certain number of letters or checks for letters in certain places in a word. Here are two examples:

		        <li>
	    			Create and test a predicate block that checks a word for a certain number of letters. Examples and information about input types are below. Your block should:
                    <ul>
						<li>Accept two inputs: a <var>word</var> and the <var>numberOfLetters</var> it should have, and</li>
                        <li>Report whether or not (using <code>true</code>/<code>false</code>) the inputted word has the inputted number of letters.</li>

		        <li>
		        	Use the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/letter-blank-of-blank.png" alt="letter () of ()" title="letter () of ()" /> block with <code>=</code> and <code>keep</code> to find words with letters in certain places.

			        </ol>
		        </li>
		        <li>
	    			Create and test a predicate block that checks for letters in certain places. Examples are below. Your block should:
                    <ul>
                   	  <li>Accept three inputs: a <var>letterNumber</var> for the place in the word, a <var>word</var>, and a <var>letter</var>, and</li>
                        <li>Report whether or not the letter number <var>letterNumber</var> in the word is the inputted letter.</li>
                    </ul>

		        </li>
                <li>
                    Use your new predicates with the <code>keep</code> block to:
	               	<div class="commentBig">
                    	<p>Using 9 for both here is a little nod to how you find the last letter (find the length and look for that letter), which they can do next. (Tip in TG.)</p>

            <ol start="7">
                <li>

						<li>Accept two inputs: a <var>letter</var> and a <var>word</var>, and</li>
                        <li>Report whether or not the last letter in the word is the inputted letter.</li>

                	A great way to approach this problem is by using <strong>problem decomposition</strong>: breaking the problem into smaller pieces. For example, you might choose to first build a <code>last letter of</code> reporter that reports the last letter of an inputted word. Then you could solve the problem more easily, like this:<br />
                	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/is-last-letter-of-word-definition.png" alt="is (letter) the last letter of (word)? block definition" title="is (letter) the last letter of (word)? block definition" /><br />
                	Using simpler blocks to define a more complicated block is an example of <em>abstraction</em> as this process hides complexity.

                    ST-I wonder if we should show them one example -may be even a gif- as they may not understand the point of using "and" to reduce the search space.
                    <br />
                    ST-I think we should have an printable/editable word/excel document of this puzzle so that kids can record their progress on the puzzle itself.  I don't think kids will take the time to redraw the whole puzzle.<br />
                    ST-We should hint that all the words in the puzzle are AP CSP related as even after using "and" to reduce search space, some blanks will have many options.  This will also show if they recognize CS vocabulary.
