            From PG: "Vaníček’s idea is to present a simple, fairly decodable script that incorporates a decision about color based on a predicate, then a set of puzzles (e.g., the large picture at top and the two small pictures below) along with other predicates that generate them and other patterns. Task for kids is selecting (and perhaps adjusting) predicates to match the puzzles.  His script was random movement and stamp (built into make a point); ours could be that, but equally it could be what we already have, freehand drawing or pure scribbling by tracking the mouse.  What appeals to me about Vaníček’s idea is that it gives a fair amount of practice in the form of play and it highlights the part of the script that we’re focusing on by giving many variations on it.  It’s similar to what I long ago had been doing with the circle puzzles and angle, except that this is clearer." <br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/predicates-idea.png" /><br />
            I (Mary) wonder if this might work well as part of <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/5-follow-the-leader/1-following-sprites.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">1.5</a>. What's here (below) looks "easier" than what's in 2.3.1 (where they have to build the two-color pen script code themselves). This could serve as a nice intermediary between the intro to conditionals in <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/new/3-if-else.html">what will become 1.2.4</a> and the codification of conditionals and work building predicates in 2.3.1. --MF, 1/8/19

			<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will develop a word puzzle solver that will search through a long list of words and report words with specific characteristics.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will review predicates and build a few that you can use in other projects.</p>

		<h3>Predicates</h3>
        <p><strong>Predicates are reporter blocks  (functions) that always report a <em>Boolean value</em></strong> (they  report only the values <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true" title="true" /> or <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false" title="false" />). In Snap<em>!</em>, they are represented by hexagonal blocks.</p> 
        <p>
          You have seen predicates before. Predicates compute the <em>condition</em> used by <em>conditionals</em> (such as <code>if</code> or <code>repeat until</code>) to decide when to do something. Predicates ask a question such as "Does the <var>player list</var> contain the player's <code>answer</code>?" or "Is this sprite touching the sprite called 'Sprite'?" <br />
