            <p>Nobody would have to ask a computer "Does spaghetti have 5 letters?"  The block should be retitled WORD ( ) HAS ( ) LETTERS so that it looks more sensible. --bh</p>

			<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will solve a crossword puzzle by combining predicates using the <code>and</code> block. You will then use the resulting predicates with <code>keep</code> to find words with specific characteristics.</p>

                    You have used the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/length-of-blank-operator.png" alt="length of ()" title="length of ()" /> block in the Operators palette together with <code>=</code> and <code>keep</code> to find words of a certain length in the <var>words list</var>.

                        <li>Reassemble that script so that you can find all the words that have 8 letters.</li>
				        <li>Find all the words that have 11 letters.</li>
                        <li>You now have an <em>expression</em> that you can edit to test any word for any number of letters. This is a useful tool to have. Create and test a predicate <em>block</em> that takes a word and number as input and works like this:<br />

                        <li>If you have not yet turned your expression into a predicate <em>block</em>, do that now.  Your block should work like this: <br />

                	Create and test a predicate block that checks whether a certain letter is in a word. Examples below. Your block should:
					<ul>
						<li>Accept two inputs: a <var>letter</var> to check for and a <var>word</var>, and</li>
                        <li>Report whether or not the input <var>word</var> has the input <var>letter</var>.</li>

                The first input is a
                <em>pattern,</em> which is a word in which some of the letters have been replaced by hyphens (minus signs).<!--  The hard part will be to write a helper<br />

                that checks whether each letter in the pattern is either the same as the corresponding letter of the input word or a hyphen. -->
