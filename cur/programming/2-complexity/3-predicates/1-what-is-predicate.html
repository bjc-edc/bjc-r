            As you know, predicates are reporter blocks (functions) that always report a <em>Boolean value</em> (they report only the values <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true" title="true" /> or <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false" title="false" />). In Snap<em>!</em>, they are represented by hexagonal blocks. Predicates compute the <em>condition</em> used by <em>conditionals</em> (such as <code>if</code> or <code>repeat until</code>) to decide when to do something. Predicates ask a question such as "Is the random number 3?" or "Is this sprite touching the sprite called 'Sprite'?" <br />
