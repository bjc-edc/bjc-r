            <p>PG: Jiry's predicate activity is beautiful and we should copy it for the predicate part. Mary's math page would be a great addition (pun) somewhere (not necessarily here). And I am also a fan of content over context, though perhaps not in the same way. I want to know /purpose/ which may differ from topical details.</p>
            <p>Can we cut this now? --MF, 8/8/19</p>

        <p><strong>Predicates are reporter blocks  (functions) that always report a <em>Boolean value</em></strong> (they  report only the values <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true" title="true" /> or <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false" title="false" />). In Snap<em>!</em>, they are represented by hexagonal blocks.</p> 
        <p>
            You have seen predicates before. Predicates compute the <em>condition</em> used by <em>conditionals</em> (such as <code>if</code> or <code>repeat until</code>) to decide when to do something. Predicates ask a question such as "Does the <var>player list</var> contain the player's <code>answer</code>?" or "Is this sprite touching the sprite called 'Sprite'?" <br />
