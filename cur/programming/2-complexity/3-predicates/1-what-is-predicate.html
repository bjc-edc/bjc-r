        <h2>What's a Predicate?</h2>

        <div class="learn">
			<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will develop tools to help solve word puzzles by searching for words that match specific characteristics.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will review predicates and build a few that you can use in other projects.</p>
		</div>

        <div class="ap-standard">AAP-2.H.1</div>
        <p>As you know, predicates are reporter blocks (functions) that always report a <em>Boolean value</em> (they report only the values <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true" title="true" /> or <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false" title="false" />). In Snap<em>!</em>, predicates are represented by hexagonal blocks. They compute the <em>condition</em> used by <em>conditionals</em> (such as <code>if</code>, <code>if else</code>, or <code>repeat until</code>) to decide when to do something.  </p>
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p>
                So, the <em>input type</em> of a conditional is Booleans, and the <em>output type</em> of a predicate is also Booleans.
                <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Input Type</strong>, <strong>Output Type</strong>, <strong>Domain</strong>, and <strong>Range</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <strong>input type</strong> (often called <strong>domain</strong> by programmers) of a function is the type of data that it accepts as input.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>output type</strong> (often called <strong>range</strong>) of a function is the type of data that it reports as output.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                Along with &quot;abstraction,&quot; these two ideas are among the most important in computer science. If you get in the habit of using them in your thinking, you'll have many fewer bugs in your programs, because you'll automatically double-check that the output type of a reporter matches the input type of the block in which you're trying to use it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Predicates ask a true/false question such as "Is the random number 3?" or "Is this sprite touching the sprite called 'Leader'?"</p>
        <p>
            Every <code>if else</code> block has two scripts inside of it, exactly one of which will be run depending on the value that the predicate reports. Then the computer continues with whatever comes after the <code>if else</code> block.<br />
