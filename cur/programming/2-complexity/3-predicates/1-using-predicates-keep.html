		<h2>Using Predicates with <code>Keep</code></h2>
		<div class="learn">
			<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will develop a word puzzle solver that will search a dictionary for words with specific characteristics.</p>
            
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will clarify your understanding of <em>predicates</em> and learn to use them with the <code>keep</code> block to keep list items with specific characteristics. </p>
			<p>
				For example, this predicate expression can be used with <code>keep</code> to find words with six letters where the fifth letter is <var>g</var>:<br />
				<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/does-have-6-letters-and-letter-5-is-g.png" alt="(does () have (6) letters?) and (letter (5) of () is (g)?)" title="(does () have (6) letters?) and (letter (5) of () is (g)?)" />

		<h3>Predicates</h3>
        <div class="sidenote">
        	<p>In <span class="snap">snap</span>, predicates are hexagonal in shape, not oval like other reporters.</p>
            <p>Notice that the two Booleans are themselves predicates because they only report <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Predicates are reporters that <strong>always report a <em>Boolean value</em></strong> (they always report either <img class="inline nopad" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true" title="true" /> or <img class="inline nopad" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false" title="false" />).</p> 
        <p>
            You have seen predicates before. Predicates are the <em>condition</em> used by <em>conditionals</em> (such as <code>if</code><!--<img class="inline nopad" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if.png" alt="if" title="if" />--> or <code>repeat until</code><!--<img class="inline nopad" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat-until.png" alt="repeat until" title="repeat until" />-->) to decide when to do something. They can also be used with <code>keep</code> to decide when to keep something.<br />

                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Discuss what a predicate is and how it is used in a program.</li>

		<h3>The <code>Keep</code> Block</h3>
		<p>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="keep" title="keep" /> block takes a list and a predicate (a true/false question) with a blank input slot as input, and it reports a new list keeping only the items from the list that match the condition defined by the predicate.</p>
        <div class="sidenote">
            <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools-mini.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" />
            Like <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/6-the-for-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">the <code>for</code> block</a>, <code>keep</code> isn't installed automatically. It has already been added to the project you will open below, but in other projects, you'll need to import tools to access the <code>keep</code> block. <br />
		</div>
    	<div class="todo">Swap this first example for a <code>length of</code> example and use this on a later page.</div>
		<p>
        	For example here, every item in the list is asked <code>is</code> <var>(the item)</var> <code>a number?</code> and only the numbers are reported:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep-example-1.png" alt="keep items such that (is () a (number)?) from {5, :), six, 7, elephant, 3} reporting {5,7,3}" title="keep items such that (is () a (number)?) from {5, :), six, 7, elephant, 3} reporting {5,7,3}" />
        </p>
        <p>
			Here, every word in the list is asked whether the first letter is <var>a</var>:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/aprilpd/keep-example-4.png" alt="keep items such that ((letter (1) of ()) = (a)) from {Ann, Olivia, Jamal, Karl, A.J., Tara} reporting {Ann, A.J.}" title="keep items such that ((letter (1) of ()) = (a)) from {Ann, Olivia, Jamal, Karl, A.J., Tara} reporting {Ann, A.J.}" />
        </p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="3">
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Discuss both examples of <code>keep</code> shown above. Be sure you understand before you go on.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
		
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p>You write the predicate that does the checking, and <strong><code>keep</code> applies the predicate to each item in the input list and then reports the list of items that make your predicate <code>true</code></strong>.</p>
			<p>Notice that the blank input slot in the predicate is <em>required</em> when using <code>keep</code>. This is where the item from the list goes each time the question is asked again.</p>
