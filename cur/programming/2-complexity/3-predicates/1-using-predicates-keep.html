		<h2>Using Predicates with <code>Keep</code></h2>
		<div class="learn">
			<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will develop a word puzzle solver that will search a list of words and report words with specific characteristics.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will review <em>predicates</em> and learn to use them with the <code>keep</code> block to keep list items with specific characteristics. </p>
		</div>

		<h3>Predicates</h3>
        <div class="sidenote">
        	<p> Booleans are themselves predicates because they only report Booleans.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Predicates are hexagonal reporters that <strong>always report a <em>Boolean value</em></strong>. That is, they only report either <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true" title="true" /> or <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false" title="false" />.</p> 
        <p>
            For example, the following predicate expression can be used with <code>keep</code> to find words with <strong>six letters where the fifth letter is <var>g</var></strong>. The blanks are where each item of the list goes to decide if it will be kept.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/does-have-6-letters-and-letter-5-is-g.png" alt="(does () have (6) letters?) and (letter (5) of () is (g)?)" title="(does () have (6) letters?) and (letter (5) of () is (g)?)" />
        </p>
        <p>
            You have seen predicates before. Predicates are the <em>condition</em> used by <em>conditionals</em> (such as <code>if</code><!--<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if.png" alt="if" title="if" />--> or <code>repeat until</code><!--<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat-until.png" alt="repeat until" title="repeat until" />-->) to decide when to do something. <br />

        <h3>The <code>Keep</code> Block</h3>
		<p>You will see how they can also be used with <code>keep</code> to decide when to keep something.</p>
        <p>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="keep" title="keep" /> block takes a list and a predicate (a true/false question) with a blank input slot as input, and it reports a new list keeping only the items from the list that match the condition defined by the predicate.</p>

                <strong>Reviewers</strong>: I'm thinking of adding a few <code>keep</code> experiments here (with a starter list) like:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Use your new predicates together with <code>keep</code> to find all the numbers in the list that are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Integers</li>
                            <li>Not integers</li>
                            <li>Odd</li>
                            <li>Between 35 and 37</li>
                            <li>Integers between 35 and 37</li>
                            <li>Either greater than 0 or even (or both)</li>

        <div class="takeNote">
            <p>You write the predicate that does the checking, and <strong><code>keep</code> applies the predicate to each item in the input list and then reports the list of items that make your predicate <code>true</code></strong>.</p>
			<p>Notice that the blank input slot in the predicate is <em>required</em> when using <code>keep</code>. This is where the item from the list goes each time the question is asked again.</p>
