        <h2><code>Keep</code>ing Items from a List</h2>
        <div class="learn">
			<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will use predicates with the <code>keep</code> block to keep items in a list that have specific characteristics.</p>
		</div>

		<p>As you know, predicates can be used with conditionals to decide <em>when</em> to <em>do</em> something; they can also be used with <code>keep</code> to decide <em>which</em> things to keep. The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" title="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" /> block takes a list and a predicate as input, and it reports a new list keeping only the items from the input list that make the condition described by the predicate true.</p>

        <p>
            For example, the following expression will find words from the <var>words list</var> whose first letter is v. The <em>blank input slot</em> is where each item of the list goes to decide if it will be kept.<br>
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/keep-example-6.png" alt="keep items  ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)" title="keep items  ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)">
		</p>

        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>String</strong> and <strong>Index</strong>
            <ul>
                <div class="ap-standard">AAP-1.C.4</div>
                <li>A <strong>string</strong> is an ordered sequence of characters.</li>
                <div class="ap-standard">AAP-1.C.3 (strings)</div>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/2-quizzes.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="You've already learned the word index">You've already learned</a> the word <strong>index</strong> for the position of an element in a list. The same word is used for the position of a character in a string (for example, a letter in a word). So the first input to <code>letter</code> is the index.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="takeNote">
            <p><strong>You write the predicate that does the checking, and <code>keep</code> applies the predicate to each item in the input list and then reports the list of items that make your predicate <code>true</code></strong>.</p>
			<p>Note that the blank input slot in the predicate is <em>required</em>; this is where each item from the list goes as it is checked by the predicate.</p>
            <div class="endnote">The <code>letter</code> block in the palette looks like <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/letter-1-of-world.png" alt="letter (1) of (world)" title="letter (1) of (world)" />.  You have to delete the "world" so that there is a blank slot where you need it to be.</div>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>

                    <div class="endnote">This project contains two example <code>keep</code> expressions and an <code>initialize list</code> procedure (you can look inside it to see what it does).</div>

                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Experiment with these examples of <code>keep</code>. Discuss and then explain <em>in writing</em> what these expressions are doing.<br />

					Here, every word in the list is asked whether the first letter is <var>a</var>:<br />

				</p>-->

            </ol>
		</div>

        <p>The first example keeps inputs of a certain <em>length</em>; every word in the list is asked whether its length is 5, and only those with five letters are reported. The second example keeps inputs that are <em>not numbers</em>; every item in this list is asked "Is this item <em>not</em> a number?" and only the elements that are not numbers are reported.</p>
        <p>There are two <code>length</code> blocks in Snap<em>!</em>. One (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/length-of-blank-operator.png" alt="length ()" title="length ()" />) is designed for strings, and the other (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/length-list.png" alt="length ()" title="length ()" />) is designed for lists.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
                <li>
					If you don't see a list of words on the stage, run <code>initialize list</code>. Then use  <code>keep</code> to answer these questions:
                    <ol>
						<li>How many 12-letter words are in <var>words list</var>?</li>
						<li>How many 15-letter words are in <var>words list</var>?</li>
