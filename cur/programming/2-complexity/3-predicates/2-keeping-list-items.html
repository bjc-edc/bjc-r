		<h2><code>Keep</code>ing Items from a List</h2>
		<div class="todo">To be more meaningful, this <code>keep</code> page could be a combination of sorting grade lists (familiar context), e.g., how many Bs (between 80 and 90); and previews of word puzzle solver stuff (number of letters and letter number). --MF</div>
		<p>Predicates can be used with conditionals to decide when to <em>do</em> something, and they can also be used with <code>keep</code> to decide when to <em>keep</em> something. The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="keep" title="keep" /> block takes a list and a predicate with a <em>blank input slot</em> as input, and it reports a new list keeping only the items from the list that match the condition described by the predicate.</p>

            <p>You write the predicate that does the checking, and <strong><code>keep</code> applies the predicate to each item in the input list and then reports the list of items that make your predicate <code>true</code></strong>.</p>
			<p>Notice that the blank input slot in the predicate is <em>required</em> when using <code>keep</code>. This is where the item from the list goes each time the question is asked again.</p>
