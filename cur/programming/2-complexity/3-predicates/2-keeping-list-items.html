		<h2><code>Keep</code>ing Items from a List</h2>
		<div class="learn">
			<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will learn to use predicates with the <code>keep</code> block to keep items in a list that have specific characteristics.</p>
		</div>

		<p>As you know, predicates can be used with conditionals to decide when to <em>do</em> something; they can also be used with <code>keep</code> to decide which things to <em>keep</em>. The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="keep" title="keep" /> block takes a list and a predicate <!--with a <em>blank input slot</em> (shown below)--> as input, and it reports a new list keeping only the items from the list that make the condition described by the predicate true.</p>
		
        <p>
            For example, the following expression will find words from the <var>words list</var> <strong>whose first letter is v</strong>. The <em>blank input slot</em> is where each item of the list goes to decide if it will be kept.<br>
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/keep-example-6.png" alt="keep items such that ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (word list)" title="keep items such that ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (word list)">
            <!--<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/does-have-6-letters-and-letter-5-is-g.png" alt="(does () have (6) letters?) and (letter (5) of () is (g)?)" title="(does () have (6) letters?) and (letter (5) of () is (g)?)" />-->
		</p>
        
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p>You write the predicate that does the checking, and <strong><code>keep</code> applies the predicate to each item in the input list and then reports the list of items that make your predicate <code>true</code></strong>.</p>
			<p>Note that the blank input slot in the predicate is <em>required</em> when using <code>keep</code>. This is where the item from the list goes each time the question is asked.</p>
