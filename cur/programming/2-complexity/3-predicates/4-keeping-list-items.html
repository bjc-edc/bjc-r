        <h2><code>Keep</code>ing Items from a List</h2>
        <div class="todo">Need to fix SUCH THAT in all images of KEEP and all corresponding alt/text. --MF, 8/12/19</div>
        <div class="learn">
			<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will use predicates with the <code>keep</code> block to keep items in a list that have specific characteristics.</p>
		</div>

		<p>As you know, predicates can be used with conditionals to decide <em>when</em> to <em>do</em> something; they can also be used with <code>keep</code> to decide <em>which</em> things to keep. The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="keep items such that () from ()" title="keep items such that () from ()" /> block takes a list and a predicate <!--with a <em>blank input slot</em> (shown below)--> as input, and it reports a new list keeping only the items from the list that make the condition described by the predicate true.</p>
		
        <p>
            For example, the following expression will find words from the <var>words list</var> whose first letter is v. The <em>blank input slot</em> is where each item of the list goes to decide if it will be kept.<br>
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/keep-example-6.png" alt="keep items such that ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)" title="keep items such that ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)">

The same word is used for the position of a character in a string (for example, a letter in a word). So the first input to <code>letter</code> is the index.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="takeNote">
            <p>You write the predicate that does the checking, and <strong><code>keep</code> applies the predicate to each item in the input list and then reports the list of items that make your predicate <code>true</code></strong>.</p>
			<p>Note that the blank input slot in the predicate is <em>required</em> when using <code>keep</code>. This is where the item from the list goes each time the question is asked.</p>

        <p>The first example keeps inputs of a certain <em>length</em>; every word in the list is asked whether its length is 5, and only those with five letters are reported.

        <p>There are two <code>length</code> blocks in Snap<em>!</em>. One (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/length-of-blank-operator.png" alt="length ()" title="length ()" />) is designed for strings, and the other (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/length-list.png" alt="length ()" title="length ()" />) is designed for lists.</p>
