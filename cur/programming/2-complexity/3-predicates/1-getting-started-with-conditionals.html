        <div class="todo">
        	From Al, 6/22/16:
            <ul>
            	<li>This is a lovely setup.  Maybe I'm not taking advantage of some feature, but when I click on the first script, the mouse runs off the stage and then follows me back, scribbling all the way.  This will make it hard to draw on the screen.  How do you (or a kid) start the script without having to mouse over to it and click?</li>
                <li>For the other three scripts and the rest of the experiment, suggest (maybe a sidenote) that they build a ``reset'' script that clears, puts the pen up, moves to (0,0) sets the direction to 90, puts the pen down, and sets the pen size to 1.</li>
                <li>Problem 3 seems easier than problem 2 (except for the mouse running off the stage when you click it).  Experimenting in 2 is fun and you learn a great deal.  But I'm almost an hour into this now, and I'm on 3.</li>
                <li>The TIFs:  How are kids answering things like B?</li>
                <li>What's the reason for C---just to get them to see that there's more than one way?</li>
                <li>The video for E works the first time you launch it and then nevermore.</li>
                <li>F:  I see what you want them to do, but on a Mac, you can lift the mouse just by hodling down the track pad as you move (this must be some kind of click---yeah:  option click)</li>
                <li>At the end:  There's something wonderful about this page.  It draws you in and helps you figure out all kinds of things about the geometry of the system.  To nail it down, maybe we could ask the kids to write something about what new stuff they learned about by doing these problems.</li>
                <li>On second thought, I realize that the setup of giving  scripts and asking them to modify them is a real hook.  It’s like trying to figure out how some mystery gadget works.  We should make this a regular feature, sort of counterpoint to the ``invent it from scratch’’ that’s also a hook.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>(this is Dan Garcia) Take it further E has the interesting feature that you can change the repeat blocks to have values that don't add to 360, but say add to 90, you get a beautiful tiger pattern.  And if they don't add to a factor of 360, the tiger pattern "moves". So there's potential for a nice conversation (add to TG) how to get the tiger pattern with the if/else that the repeat was able to give. </li> 
                <li>GH Feedback 10/20/15: Shouldn't the code in number 1 have a 'pen down' block? Are students supposed to figure that out themselves?</li>
