For example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/17-mod-5.png" alt="(17) mod (5)" title="(17) mod (5)" /> reports 2 because when 17 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2.

            <div class="pseudop">You may see these four arithmetic operators: <pre class="inline">+</pre>,  <pre class="inline">-</pre>,  <pre class="inline">*</pre>, <pre class="inline">/</pre> (plus, minus, times, divide) as well as <pre class="inline">MOD</pre>. Arithmetic operators are part of most programming languages.  (Most text languages use <pre class="inline">*</pre> rather than <pre class="inline">&times;</pre> for multiplication because <pre class="inline">&times</pre> isn't on most keyboards, and because it looks too much like the letter <pre class="inline">x</pre>.</div>
            <div class="pseudop"><strong>Order of operations:</strong> In a block language, the nesting of blocks is always visible, and determines the order in which arithmetic operations are carried out.  For example, in <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/3-times(5+4).png" alt="3 × (5 + 4)" title="3 × (5 + 4)" /> you can <em>see</em> that the <code>+</code> block fills an input slot in the <code>&times;</code> block, so the expression means 3&times;(5+4).  But in <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/(3-times-5)+4.png" alt="(3 × 5) + 4" title="(3 × 5) + 4" />, the <code>&times;</code> block is inside the <code>+</code> block, so that expression means (3&times;5)+4.  It's as if you used parentheses around <em>every</em> operation in a text language.  But text languages let you write <pre class="inline">3*4+5</pre> 
            without parentheses, so they have to use the grouping rules you learned in elementary school (multiplication before addition, and so on). The <code>mod</code> operator is like multiplication and division; it happens before addition and subtraction. </div>
            <div class="sidenoteBig">Different programming languages have different ways of handling negative inputs to the mod function.  So they avoid such examples on the exam.</div>
            <div class="pseudop"><strong>The <code>mod</code> operator:</strong> The expression <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/17-mod-5.png" alt="(17) mod (5)" title="(17) mod (5)" /> would be written as <pre class="inline">17 MOD 5</pre> on the exam. If you see an expression with variables as input to <code>mod</code>, such as <pre class="inline">a MOD b</pre>, you can assume that <var>a</var> is zero or positive, and <var>b</var> is strictly positive (because you can't divide by 0).</div>
