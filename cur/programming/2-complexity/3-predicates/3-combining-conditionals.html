                    Here are four possible ways to define <code>≥</code>. Discuss what advantages each style has: <br />

                        <li>Do they all work correctly?</li>
                        <li>Which seem elegant because they are short?</li>
                        <li>Which seem elegant because they are clear?</li>
                        <li>Which seem elegant because the steps are simple?</li>
                        <li>Which is closest to how you think about ≥ in math class?</li>
                        <li>Which seems <em>clearest to you</em>?</li>

        <p>Look back at the first two examples in the previous problem. Since the predicate expression <var>a</var> <code>=</code> <var>b</var> will report true when they are equal and false otherwise, it's unnecessary to use the nested conditional statement in the first example, and the second example using the predicate inside the <code>else</code> part is sufficient. Sometimes, however (especially when you aren't building a predicate), it can be helpful to use nested conditional statements.</p>

            <div class="comment">AAP-2.I.1, AAP-2.I.2</div>
            <p>A <strong>nested conditional statement</strong> is an <code>if</code> or <code>if else</code> statement inside the <code>else</code> part of another <code>if else</code> statement. If the predicate of the outer <code>if else</code> statement is false, then inner (nested) conditional statement will test its predicate and decide what to do.</p>
