        ST EK List: At least these EK's need to be covered<br />
       5.1.2D Program documentation helps programmers develop and maintain correct programs to efficiently solve problems. (with documentation)	<br />
       5.1.2E Documentation about program components, such as segments and procedures, helps in developing and maintaining programs. (with documentation)<br />		
       5.1.2F Documentation helps in developing and maintaining programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. (with documentation)<br />	
       5.1.2H Consultation and communication with program users is an important aspect of program development to solve problems. (2.1.2.7 add #7: "get someone else to try your program. Then ask them whether there is anything that is confusing or anything you could improve.)<br />
       5.1.2I A programmer's knowledge and skill affects how a program is developed and how it is used to solve a problem.	(On debugging summary page: "Don't feel as if you are supposed to find it trivial to debug. programmers take years to get better at debugging. You are a beginning. It's ok.)<br />
       5.4.1A Program style can affect the determination of program correctness. ()<br />
        5.4.1D Longer code segments are harder to reason about than shorter code segments in a program.	 (but with BH's abstraction stuff.)<br />
        5.4.1H Visual displays (or different modalities) of program state can help in finding errors. (with visual stepping)<br />
        5.4.1I Programmers justify and explain a program's correctness.	<br />
        5.4.1J Justification can include a written explanation about how a program meets its specifications. (5.3.1.1 where we ask them to explain their algorithm. make them write down instead of just discuss.)<br />
        5.4.1K Correctness of a program depends on correctness of program components, including code segments and procedures. (part of debugging is to debug the pieces. Add to brick wall)<br />
        5.4.1L An explanation of a program helps people understand the functionality and purpose of it.	 (with documentation; add program notes to contact list project; also add to list of snap features below)<br />
        5.4.1M The functionality of a program is often described by how a user interacts with it.	(do as part of addressing 5.4.1L)<br />
        5.4.1N The functionality of a program is best described at a high level by what the program does, not at the lower level of how the program statements work to accomplish this.	(do as part of addressing 5.4.1L)<br />

            <strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn about the basics of debugging in Snap<em>!</em> and some programming principles and habits that will help you minimize bugs in your programs.<br />

        <h4>What is Debugging?</h4> 
        Debugging is the art of identifying errors in computer programs and finding  ways of resolving them.<br /><br />
        
        
        <h4>Debugging Principles </h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Recognize the existence of a bug </li>
        <li>When you experience a bug, do <em>not</em> delete your project and start over.</li>
        <li>Reproduce several times the error that the bug creates </li>
        <li>Isolate the piece of code producing the error</li>
        <li>Identify the specific cause of the error within that code</li>
		<li>Debug by subtraction not addition.  That is do not add code that works around the bug</li>
        <li>Fix the error</li>
        <li>Test thoroughly including consideration of special cases (Note: Should be move down under good programming habits; it's an anti-bugging strategy)</li>
        <li>Keep a log of bugs you encounter throughout the year and add any new bugs found to this log.  Include in the log any test cases that helped you identify the bugs.</li>
        <li>Love your bugs!  They give you insight into programming and a make you better at it!</li>
        </ul><br />
        
        <h4>Some Debugging Tools in Snap<em>!</em></h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Use <code>pause all</code> block to place breaks in your code and step through your code at will.

Notice that it is possible to adjust the speed at which the stepping is done.  During the stepping, the color of the block currently being executed changes to <span style="color:#00F5F5">cyan</span>.  Notice how stepping is done when there is a loop within a loop.  If there is an error in your code, stepping will help you to identify the block(s) causing the error.</p>

        <h4>Recommended Programming Habits to Minimize Bugs</h4>

        <div id="hint-commenting" class="collapse">
       Below is an animation that shows how to add comments to your code.  Notice that a comment attached to the hat block in the block editor becomes the help screen for a custom block.<br />

       </div>
       </li>
       <li>Assemble neat and organized code.  Delete any unused blocks and avoid clutter.

       <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/organized-code.png"  height="300" alt=""/><br />
       You can delete any unused block by dragging it out of the scripting area or by using the <em>delete</em> option in its context menu.  If you wish to permanently remove a custom block you have created and all of its instances, you can choose the <em>delete block definition</em> option from its context menu.<br />

       </div>
       
       </li>
       <li>Use sensible naming of variables. Take advantage of Snap<em>!</em>'s flexibility with variable names including use of spaces.

        <div id="hint-variable-name" class="collapse">  Below you see an example of a poor choice of a variable name (which will confuse even the programmer) and a good choice of name for the same variable.<br />
