        <h4>What is Debugging?</h4> 
        Debugging is the art of identifying errors in computer programs and finding  ways of resolving them.<br /><br />
        
        <h4>Debugging Principles </h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Recognize the existence of a bug </li>
        <li>Reproduce several times the error that the bug creates </li>
        <li>Isolate the piece of code producing the error</li>
        <li>Identify the specific cause of the error within that code</li>
		<li>Debug by subtraction not addition.  That is do not add code that works around the bug</li>
        <li>Fix the error</li>
        <li>Test thoroughly including consideration of special cases</li>
        <li>Keep a log of bugs you encounter throughout the year and add any new bugs found to this log.  Include in the log any test cases that helped you identify the bugs.</li>
        <li>Love your bugs!  They give you insight into programming and a make you better at it!</li>
        </ul><br />
        <h4>Some Debugging Tools and Techniques in Snap<em>!</em></h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Use <code>pause all</code> block to place breaks in your code and step through your code at will.
        <a href="#hint-pause" data-toggle="collapse" title="Using say blocks in Snap!"><br />Click for a demo.</a>
        <div id="hint-pause" class="collapse">
        <p>Click below to see an animation about how to use of <code>pause all</code> block to break the execution of your code.  Notice how Pause/Play button next to the Green Flag is used to step through the code.</p>
        <img data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/PauseAll.gif" height="350" alt="Using pause all block in Snap!"/>
        </div>
       
        </li>
        <li>Use <code>say()for()secs</code> blocks in Snap<em>!</em> to get information about the state of the program etc. and to put breaks into the program.<a href="#hint-say-blocks" data-toggle="collapse" title="Using say blocks in Snap!"><br />Click for a demo.</a>
        <div id="hint-say-blocks" class="collapse">
        <p>Below you see an animation about the use of <code>say()for()secs</code> blocks to fix buggy code for drawing a rectangle.  Notice how these blocks introduce a pause and help identify the source of error <!--as a missing <code>turn&#8634;(90)degrees</code> block-->.</p>
        <img  data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/UseofSayinRectangle.gif"  height="400" alt=""/>
        
        </div>
        </li>
        <li>
        Use <strong><em>Visual Stepping </em></strong>  in Snap<em>!</em>.<a href="#hint-visual-stepping" data-toggle="collapse" title="Learn Visual Stepping in Snap!"><br />Click for a demo.</a>
                <div id="hint-visual-stepping" class="collapse">
                <p>Below you see an animation about how to use Visual Stepping in Snap<em>!</em>.  Be sure to <strong>watch the code</strong> not just the sprite.  Notice that it is possible to adjust the speed at which the stepping is done.  During the stepping, the color of the block currently being executed changes to <span style="color:#00F5F5">cyan</span>.  Notice how stepping is done when there is a loop within a loop.  If there is an error in your code, stepping will help you to identify the block(s) causing the error.</p>
                <img  data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/VisualSteppinginFractal.gif"  width="750" alt=""/>
                <p>In Visual Stepping, if you bring the slider all the way to the left, then you can single-step your code by pressing the Pause/Play button next to the Green Flag.</p>
                <img data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/VisualPauseSteppinginFractal.gif" width="750" alt=""/>
          </div>
        </li>
        
        <li>Show the variables to display their current values.<a href="#hint-debugging" data-toggle="collapse" title="Learn Visual Stepping in Snap!"><br />Click for a demo.</a>
        <div id="hint-debugging" class="collapse">
        <p>Below you see an animation that shows how several debugging tools in Snap<em>!</em>, including the display of variables, can be used to fix a buggy code that was intended to compute the sum of the first 5 whole numbers: 1+2+3+4+5. </p>
        <img data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/DebuggingSum.gif" width="1065" height="350" alt=""/>
        </div>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Recommended Programming Habits to Minimize Bugs</h4>
       <ul>
       
       <li>Document your program using comments in Snap<em>!</em>.  <a href="#hint-commenting" data-toggle="collapse" title="Commenting in Snap!"><br />Click for a demo.</a>
        <div id="hint-commenting" class="collapse">
       Below is an animation that shows how to add comments to your code.  Notice that a comment attached to the hat block in the block editor becomes the help screen for a custom block.<br />
       <img data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/Commenting-Help.gif" height="400" alt=""/>
       
       </div>
       </li>
       <li>Assemble neat and organized code.  Delete any unused blocks and avoid clutter.
       <a href="#hint-organization" data-toggle="collapse" title="Organizing blocks in Snap!"><br />Click for examples.</a>
        <div id="hint-organization" class="collapse">  Below you see an example of a messy code and an example of neatly organized and commented code.<br />
       <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/messy-code.png"  height="300" alt=""/>
       <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/organized-code.png"  height="300" alt=""/><br />
       You can delete any unused block by dragging it out of the scripting area or by using the <em>delete</em> option in its context menu.  If you wish to permanently remove a custom block you have created and all of its instances, you can choose the <em>delete block definition</em> option from its context menu.<br />
       <img data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/Deleting-Blocks.gif"  height="250" alt=""/>
       
       </div>
       
       </li>
       <li>Use sensible naming of variables. Take advantage of Snap<em>!</em>'s flexibility with variable names including use of spaces.
       <a href="#hint-variable-name" data-toggle="collapse" title="Organizing blocks in Snap!"><br />Click for examples.</a>
        <div id="hint-variable-name" class="collapse">  Below you see an example of a poor choice of a variable name (which will confuse even the programmer) and a good choice of name for the same variable.<br />
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/bad-variable-name.png"  height="125" alt=""/><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/good-variable-name.png"  height="125" alt=""/>
        </div>
        </li>
       <li>Use of abstraction to hide complexity of code.
       <a href="#hint-abstraction" data-toggle="collapse" title="Organizing blocks in Snap!"><br />Click for examples.</a>
        <div id="hint-abstraction" class="collapse">  Below you see a long and complex script to draw nested polygons, and a short script performing the same task though greatly simplified through the use of abstraction.<br />
       <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/without-abstraction.png"  height="250" alt=""/>
       <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/with-abstraction.png"  height="250" alt=""/>
       </div>
       </li>
       </ul><br />
       
        <div class="forYouToDo">

Fix the bug(s) in each script and share with your partner any debugging techniques you have used. <br /><br />
         
         
         Give kids some debugging challenges in Snap<em>!</em> here.<br />
         Possible examples: Bugs that make program loop forever, bugs due to giving out wrong answers/producing wrong results, bugs due to failing to meet specs, bugs that appear only under special cases.  Either as images or in a starter file.</li>
