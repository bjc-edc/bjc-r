        ST EK List: At least these EK's need to be covered<br />
       5.1.2D Program documentation helps programmers develop and maintain correct programs to efficiently solve problems. (with documentation)	<br />
       5.1.2E Documentation about program components, such as segments and procedures, helps in developing and maintaining programs. (with documentation)<br />		
       5.1.2F Documentation helps in developing and maintaining programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. (with documentation)<br />	
       5.1.2H Consultation and communication with program users is an important aspect of program development to solve problems. (2.1.2.7 add #7: "get someone else to try your program. Then ask them whether there is anything that is confusing or anything you could improve.)<br />
       5.1.2I A programmer's knowledge and skill affects how a program is developed and how it is used to solve a problem.	(On debugging summary page: "Don't feel as if you are supposed to find it trivial to debug. programmers take years to get better at debugging. You are a beginning. It's ok.)<br />
       5.4.1A Program style can affect the determination of program correctness. ()<br />
        5.4.1D Longer code segments are harder to reason about than shorter code segments in a program.	 (but with BH's abstraction stuff.)<br />
        5.4.1H Visual displays (or different modalities) of program state can help in finding errors. (with visual stepping)<br />
        5.4.1I Programmers justify and explain a program's correctness.	<br />
        5.4.1J Justification can include a written explanation about how a program meets its specifications. (5.3.1.1 where we ask them to explain their algorithm. make them write down instead of just discuss.)<br />
        5.4.1K Correctness of a program depends on correctness of program components, including code segments and procedures. (part of debugging is to debug the pieces. Add to brick wall)<br />
        5.4.1L An explanation of a program helps people understand the functionality and purpose of it.	 (with documentation; add program notes to contact list project; also add to list of snap features below)<br />
        5.4.1M The functionality of a program is often described by how a user interacts with it.	(do as part of addressing 5.4.1L)<br />
        5.4.1N The functionality of a program is best described at a high level by what the program does, not at the lower level of how the program statements work to accomplish this.	(do as part of addressing 5.4.1L)<br />

        <h4>What is Debugging?</h4> 
        Debugging is the art of identifying errors in computer programs and finding  ways of resolving them.<br /><br />
        
        <div class="commentBig">
        <p>Overall, I love the content on this page. I'm so glad we are getting this into the course. Thank you, Selim!</p>
        <p>Mostly, my concerns are around the pedagogy of dropping all these ideas on the student all at once. I don't think that will lead to learning these principles or assimilating them as practices. I think we should be introducing these ideas one at a time in the context of projects where each specific strategy will be helpful. We could <em>summarize</em> the ideas on a single page at the end of the unit, but I think that would be a <em>secondary</em> priority to integrating these into useful contexts where students can see the benefit of using these strategies and get some practice. --MF, 3/5/18</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Debugging Principles </h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Recognize the existence of a bug </li>
        <li>Reproduce several times the error that the bug creates </li>
        <li>Isolate the piece of code producing the error</li>
        <li>Identify the specific cause of the error within that code</li>
		<li>Debug by subtraction not addition.  That is do not add code that works around the bug</li>
        <li><s>Fix the error</s></li>
        <li>Test thoroughly including consideration of special cases (Note: Should be move down under good programming habits; it's an anti-bugging strategy)</li>
        <li>Keep a log of bugs you encounter throughout the year and add any new bugs found to this log.  Include in the log any test cases that helped you identify the bugs.</li>
        <li>Love your bugs!  They give you insight into programming and a make you better at it!
        <div class="todo">
            Thoughts from Brian:
            <ul>
                <li>Say early: "When you experience a bug, do not delete your project and start over."</li>
                <li>The above list items are not all at the same level of abstraction. Maybe a list isn't the right thing. Maybe a little story would be better&mdash;something that shows how to approach debugging. Maybe call it "list of debugging practices" and make it a link.</li>
                <li>Meta-advice: we can't ever predict the kind of bugs that will actually happen.</li>

        <h4>Some Debugging Tools <s>and Techniques</s> in Snap<em>!</em></h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Use <code>pause all</code> block to place breaks in your code and step through your code at will.
        <a href="#hint-pause" data-toggle="collapse" title="Using say blocks in Snap!"><br />Click for a demo.</a>
        <div class="todo"><p>Use in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/4-mandala.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">2.2.4</a></p><p>"In this simple example, there is only one script running. The reason it's called <code>pause all</code> is that if you have multiple scripts running, it will pause all of them until the yellow button is clicked."</p></div>
        <div id="hint-pause" class="collapse">
        <p>Click below to see an animation about how to use of <code>pause all</code> block to break the execution of your code.  Notice how Pause/Play button next to the Green Flag is used to step through the code.</p>

        </div>
       
        </li>
        <li>Use <code>say()for()secs</code> blocks in Snap<em>!</em> to get information about the state of the program etc. and to put breaks into the program.<a href="#hint-say-blocks" data-toggle="collapse" title="Using say blocks in Snap!"><br />Click for a demo.</a>
        <div class="todo">
          <p>Brian suggests adding such data to a list rather than using <code>say</code>. Mary suggests doing both; <code>say</code> can be taught earlier (in U1L3) and the list approach can be added to the strategy after kids have learned about them. --MF, 3/5/18</p>
          <p>Use in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/7-graphics-and-art.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">1.3.7.2</a></div>
        <div id="hint-say-blocks" class="collapse">
        <p>Below you see an animation about the use of <code>say()for()secs</code> blocks to fix buggy code for drawing a rectangle.  Notice how these blocks introduce a pause and help identify the source of error <!--as a missing <code>turn&#8634;(90)degrees</code> block-->.</p>

                <p>Below you see an animation about how to use Visual Stepping in Snap<em>!</em>.  Be sure to <strong>watch the code</strong> not just the sprite.  Notice that it is possible to adjust the speed at which the stepping is done.  During the stepping, the color of the block currently being executed changes to <span style="color:#00F5F5">cyan</span>.  Notice how stepping is done when there is a loop within a loop.  If there is an error in your code, stepping will help you to identify the block(s) causing the error.</p>

        <h4>Recommended Programming Habits to Minimize Bugs</h4>
       <ul>
       
       <li>Document your program using comments in Snap<em>!</em>.  <a href="#hint-commenting" data-toggle="collapse" title="Commenting in Snap!"><br />Click for a demo.</a>
        <div class="todo"><p>Somewhere in 1.3.</p>
          <p>Show stupid comments (like moves input number of steps)</p>
        </div>
        <div id="hint-commenting" class="collapse">
       Below is an animation that shows how to add comments to your code.  Notice that a comment attached to the hat block in the block editor becomes the help screen for a custom block.<br />
       <img data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/Commenting-Help.gif" height="400" alt=""/>
       
       </div>
       </li>
       <li>Assemble neat and organized code.  Delete any unused blocks and avoid clutter.
       <a href="#hint-organization" data-toggle="collapse" title="Organizing blocks in Snap!"><br />Click for examples.</a>
       <div class="todo">
       <p>Why is Alonzo tipped over in the first one? If there isn't a reason, he should be like the one on the right. --MF, 3/5/18</p>
       <p>Do simply and not school-like. Somewhere in U1?</p>
       </div> 
        <div id="hint-organization" class="collapse">  Below you see an example of a messy code and an example of neatly organized and commented code.<br />

       <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/organized-code.png"  height="300" alt=""/><br />
       You can delete any unused block by dragging it out of the scripting area or by using the <em>delete</em> option in its context menu.  If you wish to permanently remove a custom block you have created and all of its instances, you can choose the <em>delete block definition</em> option from its context menu.<br />
       <img data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/Deleting-Blocks.gif"  height="250" alt=""/>
       
       </div>
       
       </li>
       <li>Use sensible naming of variables. Take advantage of Snap<em>!</em>'s flexibility with variable names including use of spaces.
       <a href="#hint-variable-name" data-toggle="collapse" title="Organizing blocks in Snap!"><br />Click for examples.</a>
       <div class="todo">
       <p>This one is a little risky. Plenty of programmers (ahem, me included) use abbreviations like on the left. In text-based languages (like many/most of the languages that kids will use after this class), it's nicer not to have to type a long name repeatedly. Some programming interfaces have auto-complete, but others don't. I don't think this is a general principle that we should teach. I suggest we cut this one. --MF, 3/5/18</p>
       <p>Do simply. Somewhere in U1?</p>
       </div>
        <div id="hint-variable-name" class="collapse">  Below you see an example of a poor choice of a variable name (which will confuse even the programmer) and a good choice of name for the same variable.<br />

       <li>Use abstraction to hide complexity of code.

        <div class="todo">
        <p>Yes! This is a core idea of U2, and we could even introduce it in U1L3. But, wait, is this really a principle of debugging? I guess, if we split this all up, it won't matter. I tend to briefly <em>add</em> bugs when I abstract something I realize would be better abstracted. ;) --MF, 3/5/18</p>
