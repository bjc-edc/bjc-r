        </div>
        
        <h4>Good Programming Habits</h4>
       <ul>
       <li>Assemble neat and organized code.</li>
       <li>Document your program using comments in Snap<em>!</em>.  <a href="#hint-commenting" data-toggle="collapse" title="Using say blocks in Snap!"><br />Click for a demo.</a>
        <div id="hint-commenting" class="collapse">
       
       <img data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/Commenting.gif" width="484" height="300" alt=""/>
       
       </div>
       </li>
       <li>Use sensible naming of variables. Take advantage of Snap<em>!</em>'s flexibility with variable names including use of spaces.</li>
       <li>Use of abstraction to hide complexity of code.</li>
       </ul><br />
        <h4>What is Debugging?</h4> 
        Debugging is the art of identifying errors in computer programs and finding  ways of resolving them.<br /><br />
        
        <h4>Debugging Principles </h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Recognize the existence of a bug </li>
        <li>Reproduce several times the error that the bug creates </li>
        <li>Find the source of the error</li>
        <li>Identify the specific cause of the error</li>
        <li>Fix the error</li>
        <li>Test thoroughly including consideration of special cases</li>
        </ul><br />
        <h4>Some Debugging Tools and Techniques in Snap<em>!</em></h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Use <code>pause all</code> block to place breaks in your code and step through your code at will.
        <a href="#hint-pause" data-toggle="collapse" title="Using say blocks in Snap!"><br />Click for a demo.</a>
        <div id="hint-pause" class="collapse">
        <p>Click below to see an animation about how to use of <code>pause all</code> block to break the execution of your code.  Notice how Pause/Play button next to the Green Flag is used to step through the code.</p>
        <img data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/PauseAll.gif" height="350" alt="Using pause all block in Snap!"/>
        </div>
       
        </li>
        <li>Use <code>say()for()secs</code> blocks in Snap<em>!</em> to get information about the state of the program etc. and to put breaks into the program.<a href="#hint-say-blocks" data-toggle="collapse" title="Using say blocks in Snap!"><br />Click for a demo.</a>
        <div id="hint-say-blocks" class="collapse">
        <p>Below you see an animation about the use of <code>say()for()secs</code> blocks to fix buggy code for drawing a rectangle.  Notice how these blocks introduce a pause and help identify the source of error <!--as a missing <code>turn&#8634;(90)degrees</code> block-->.</p>
        <img  data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/UseofSayinRectangle.gif"  height="400" alt=""/>
        
        </div>
        </li>
        <li>
        Use <strong><em>Visual Stepping </em></strong>  in Snap<em>!</em>.<a href="#hint-visual-stepping" data-toggle="collapse" title="Learn Visual Stepping in Snap!"><br />Click for a demo.</a>
                <div id="hint-visual-stepping" class="collapse">
                <p>Below you see an animation about how to use Visual Stepping in Snap<em>!</em>.  Notice that it is possible to adjust the speed at which the stepping is done.  During the stepping, the color of the block currently being executed changes to <span style="color:#00F5F5">cyan</span>.  Notice how stepping is done when there is a loop within a loop.  If there is an error in your code, stepping will help you to identify the block(s) causing the error.</p>
                <img  data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/VisualSteppinginFractal.gif"  height="425" alt=""/>
                </div>
        </li>
        
        <li>Show the variables to display their current values.<a href="#hint-debugging" data-toggle="collapse" title="Learn Visual Stepping in Snap!"><br />Click for a demo.</a>
        <div id="hint-debugging" class="collapse">
        <p>Below you see an animation that shows how several debugging tools in Snap<em>!</em>, including the display of variables, can be used to fix a buggy code that was intended to compute the sum of the first 5 whole numbers: 1+2+3+4+5. </p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
      	 <ol>
         
         <li>Give kids some debugging challenges in Snap<em>!</em> here.<br />
         Possible examples: Bugs that make program loop forever, bugs due to giving out wrong answers/producing wrong results, bugs due to failing to meet specs, bugs that appear only under special cases.  Either as images or in a starter file.</li>
         <li>Let kids create their own buggy code and challenge each other to fix.</li>
         </ol>
