        ST EK List: At least these EK's need to be covered<br />
       5.1.2D Program documentation helps programmers develop and maintain correct programs to efficiently solve problems. (IMPORTANT)	<br />
       5.1.2E Documentation about program components, such as segments and procedures, helps in developing and maintaining programs.<br />		
       5.1.2F Documentation helps in developing and maintaining programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments<br />	
       5.1.2H Consultation and communication with program users is an important aspect of program development to solve problems.<br />
       5.1.2I A programmer's knowledge and skill affects how a program is developed and how it is used to solve a problem.	<br />
       5.4.1A Program style can affect the determination of program correctness.<br />
        5.4.1D Longer code segments are harder to reason about than shorter code segments in a program.	<br />
        5.4.1H Visual displays (or different modalities) of program state can help in finding errors.	<br />
        5.4.1I Programmers justify and explain a programâ€™s correctness.	<br />
        5.4.1J Justification can include a written explanation about how a program meets its specifications.	<br />
        5.4.1K Correctness of a program depends on correctness of program components, including code segments and procedures.	<br />
        5.4.1L An explanation of a program helps people understand the functionality and purpose of it.	<br />
        5.4.1M The functionality of a program is often described by how a user interacts with it.	<br />
        5.4.1N The functionality of a program is best described at a high level by what the program does, not at the lower level of how the program statements work to accomplish this.	<br />

        <h4>Good Programming Habits</h4>
       Program documentation and commenting in Snap<em>!</em>
        <h4>What is Debugging?</h4> 
        <h4>Debugging Techniques in Snap<em>!</em></h4>
        Reproduce the error, find the source of the error, fix the error, test again including special cases.<br />
        Show the variables to display the current values of the variables.<br />
        Use <code>Say () for () secs</code> blocks in Snap<em>!</em> to get information about the state of the program etc. and to put breaks into the program<br />
        Visual Stepping in Snap<em>!</em> including an animation showing the stepping process<br />
        <h4>Debugging Challenges in Snap<em>!</em> code</h4>
         Bugs that crash the computer/loop forever, bugs due to giving out wrong answers/producing wrong results, bugs due to failing to meet specs, bugs that appear only unders special cases, undetected bugs
        <h4>Program correctness</h4> 
        <h4>Program Testing with users</h4>
