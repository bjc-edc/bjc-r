        	<p><strong>Debugging</strong> is the art of identifying errors in computer programs and finding  ways of resolving them.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Dos and Don'ts</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Do reproduce the problem several times</strong> so you are sure you know how to recreate it. This will help you know when you've fixed it. </li>
                <li><strong>Do isolate the piece of code producing the error.</strong> Test pieces of your code separately so you know what's working and what isn't.</li>
                <li><strong>Do identify the specific cause of the error</strong> within that code. <em>Why</em> is that code doing the wrong thing?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Don't delete your project and start over.</strong> This is a waste of your time and all of your code that <em>is</em> working. You might end up with the same bug again, and you might end up with new bugs in parts of the program that you had working before. </li>
                <li><strong>Don't <em>add</em> code to work around the bug.</strong> Actually fix the bug. Think: "debug by subtraction not by addition."</li>
                <li><strong>Don't be hard on yourself.</strong> <em>Everyone</em> gets bugs in their programs; it's part of programming.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>
        	<ul>
                <li><strong>Always test your code with different inputs.</strong> What if the input is really big, zero, negative, or a decimal? What if the user types something you aren't expecting? What if the user clicks somewhere else?</li>
                <div class="comment">Do we really believe that you should keep a list? Do any of us actually do this? --MF, 5/11/18</div>
                <li><strong>Keep a list of bugs you encounter and your solutions.</strong> The same bugs may come up again in a slightly different way, and your record will make fixing a similar bug next time less frustrating. Include any test cases that helped you identify the bugs (for example, "try inputting a word instead of a number").</li>
                <li><strong>Love your bugs!</strong> They pose an interesting puzzle, and help you become a better programmer.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

		<h3>Good Habits to Minimize Bugs</h3>
		<div>
        	<ul>
            	<li>
                    <strong>Document your program</strong> using comments.
                    <div class="endnote">You learned about Snap<em>!</em>comments in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/3-blocks-with-inputs.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 1 Lab 3 Page 3: Blocks with Inputs">Unit 1 Lab 3 Page 3: Blocks with Inputs</a>.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keep your code tidy.</strong> Delete unused blocks, and use the Snap<em>!</em>'s "clean up" feature to organize your code.
                    <div class="endnote">You learned about code organization in <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/4-modify-your-pinwheel.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 1 Lab 3 Page 4: Modify Your Pinwheel">Unit 1 Lab 3 Page 4: Modify Your Pinwheel</a></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Use readable names</strong> for blocks and variables. 
                    
                    <div class="endnote">
                    In text-based programming languages (Python, Java, etc.) you may not be able to use spaces in variable or procedure names, and because programmers have to write the name out each time, it's common to abbreviate names. But this makes the names harder to read and understand what they mean. For example in Snap<em>!</em>, you might use a variable name like <var>Alonzo's Current Score</var>, but in a text-based language, you might end up with <var>aloCurScr</var>. Take advantage of Snap<em>!</em>'s flexibility with naming, and make your blocks and variables with sensible names that you will remember later and other people can understand easily.

				</li>
				<li>
                    <strong>Use abstraction</strong> to hide the complexity of code. Examples of abstraction include: using loops to repeat, using custom blocks, using an abstract data type.

                    The following two programs do the same thing, and they both use some abstraction, but the version on the right uses more.

                        Solutions:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The most likely response would be to point out how the code uses <code>repeat</code> instead of listing each <code>move</code>, <code>turn</code> sequence 3, 4, 5, or 6 times.</li>
                            <li>The two most likely responses would be the use of a <code>polygon block</code> instead of <code>move</code>, <code>turn</code> and the use of a <code>for</code> loop instead of multiple <code>repeat</code> blocks. You might ask students: "What else does the second version of the code do differently?" to draw attention to the fact that the second version also determines the correct turning angle from the number of sides. </li>
                            <li>
                                Many possible responses. Here are some examples:

                                    <li>It's easier to tell what the code will do just by reading it.</li>
                                    <li>If you want to change something about how the shapes are drawn, you only have to change the code inside <code>polygon</code> one time.</li>
                                    <li>If you need to debug, you have fewer places to look for errors.</li>
                                    <li>The <code>polygon</code> block can be reused in another part of the program.</li>
                                    <li>You only have to change one number to add more levels of polygons..</li>
