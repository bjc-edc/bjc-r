        	One early case of "debugging" was when an actual moth got stuck inside a computer in 1947. Here is a page from Grace Hopper's notebook with the moth pasted in:

        	<p><strong>Debugging</strong> is the art of identifying errors in computer programs and fixing them.</p>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reproduce the problem</strong> so you are sure you know how to recreate it. This will help you know when you've fixed it. </li>
                <li><strong>Isolate the piece of code producing the error.</strong> Test pieces of your code separately so you know what's working and what isn't.</li>
                <li><strong>Identify the specific cause of the error</strong> within that code. <em>Why</em> is that code doing the wrong thing?</li>
                <li><strong>Don't delete your project and start over.</strong> This sounds obvious when you see it written down, but programming students sometimes get angry at their bugs. Remember that if you have a program with 20 blocks in it, and one of the 20 has an error, then your program is 95% correct.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't <em>add</em> code to work around the bug.</strong> Don't edit the code at all until you understand why it's not doing what you intended, then remove the error. Think: "Debug by subtraction, not by addition."</li>
                <li><strong>Don't be hard on yourself.</strong> <em>Everyone</em> gets bugs in their programs; it's part of programming.</li>
                <li><strong>Always test your code with different inputs.</strong> What if the input is really big, zero, negative, or a decimal? What if the user types something you aren't expecting? What if the user clicks somewhere else?</li>
                <li><strong>Keep a list of bugs you encounter and your solutions.</strong> The same bugs may come up again in a slightly different way, and your record will make fixing a similar bug next time less frustrating. Include any test cases that helped you identify the bugs (for example, "try inputting a word instead of a number").</li>
                <div class="todo">Do we really believe that you should keep a list? Do any of us actually do this? --MF, 5/11/18</div>
                <li>
                	<strong>Love your bugs!</strong> They pose an interesting puzzle. Sometimes their incorrect behavior suggests another project:<br />

					<strong>Use meaningful names</strong> for blocks and variables. Some programmers try to save time by naming all their variables <var>x</var>.

                        <p>Not all programming languages allow spaces in variable names, but they all allow <em>some</em> way to separate words: <var>horizontal-position</var> or <var>horizontal.position</var> or <var>horizontal_position</var> or, if all else fails, <var>HorizontalPosition</var>.</p>

	                <strong>Use abstraction</strong> to hide the complexity of code. Examples of abstraction include: using custom blocks, using an abstract data type. These kinds of abstraction allow you to build and test pieces of your code one at a time, so bugs are automatically isolated.

                        We need to decide what counts as an abstraction.  If every REPEAT is an abstraction, as suggested here, or every procedure call is an abstraction, as suggested by the College Board, then the word loses all its explanatory power. --bh

                            <li>The most likely response would be to point out how the code uses <code>repeat</code> instead of listing each <code>move</code>, <code>turn</code> sequence 3, 4, 5, or 6 times.</li>
                            <li>The two most likely responses would be the use of a <code>polygon block</code> instead of <code>move</code>, <code>turn</code> and the use of a <code>for</code> loop instead of multiple <code>repeat</code> blocks. You might ask students: "What else does the second version of the code do differently?" to draw attention to the fact that the second version also determines the correct turning angle from the number of sides. </li>
