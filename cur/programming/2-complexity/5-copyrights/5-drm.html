       7.3.1E Commercial and governmental censorship of digital information raise legal and ethical concerns.<br />
       7.3.1P The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) has been a benefit and a challenge in making copyrighted digital material widely available.

    	<h2>Software as Copyright Enforcement</h2>

        	<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn how encryption is used for copyright enforcement.</p>

        <h3>Digital Rights Management (DRM)</h3>
        <p>Computers and the Internet support the free exchange of media, but they can also be used to prevent it. Many digital media are distributed in encrypted form. Purchasers (or their friends) can't play the media unless the software that comes with them is used to decrypt them, and the software will refuse to do so unless certain conditions are met. These conditions can be anything the publisher wants. Maybe a file can only be played on a particular computer. Maybe there can't be two copies with the same serial number. (The software uses the Internet to connect with a DRM server to check this.) Maybe the file times out on a particular date and can never be used again.</p>
        <p>DRM software is a big change in the social contract. Remember, the idea of copyright is that eventually it expires, and the work is in the public domain, freely copyable by anyone. But DRM allows publishers to have it both ways: they get copyright protection during the time when a work is most popular, <em>and</em> they get DRM protection forever. The publisher's control over the material never ends.</p>
        
        <h3>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act</h3>
        <p>The DMCA is a US law that went into effect in 1998. It makes it a crime to figure out how to defeat DRM systems, whether or not a copyright is actually violated. It protects Internet service providers and web site operators from third-party copyright violation penalties (for example, if you post a copyrighted video on YouTube, YouTube is not liable) provided that the operator (YouTube) removes the infringing material as soon as it is notified of the violation. If the original poster thinks the material does not violate a copyright, the burden is on them to prove it.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Temporary exemptions to the anti-circumvention part of the DMCA can be made by the Librarian of Congress (a surprising choice, since the Library of Congress previously wasn't involved in judging copyright issues) for a three-year period, but any such exemption must be renewed by the Librarian every three years. Most such exemptions are made for technical reasons, e.g., to allow one piece of equipment to work with another piece of equipment from a different manufacturer. But there was great excitement in 2010 when the Librarian of Congress allowed people to jailbreak their cell phones (but not their tablets).</div>
        <p>Below are two examples of manufacturers using the DMCA in creative ways, possibly not for purposes envisioned in the original copyright provisions.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>Lexmark Printers</strong></h4>
        <p>Inkjet printer manufacturers don't make much money when you buy a printer; fierce competition drives prices down to their marginal cost. Instead, they make their profits when you buy replacement ink cartridges because you have to buy ones that fit the printer, and they generally come from the manufacturer. Lexmark, a printer manufacturer, developed a technology by which printers would not use cartridges unless they provided a Lexmark digital signature; the same cartridge could not be refilled after its ink ran out the first time. Another company reverse-engineered the cartridge and created their own cartridges that would work with Lexmark's printers. Lexmark sued under the DMCA, claiming a copyright violation because the other company copied the tiny program in the cartridge that provided the signature. After several appeals (one technical legal aspect of the case went to the Supreme Court), the ultimate decision was against Lexmark; what they did was found not to be a legitimate use of the DMCA.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>DVD Region Codes</strong></h4>
        <p>If you look at the fine print on the back of a DVD case, you'll probably find something like "this DVD is licensed for sale in North America," or maybe "North America and Europe." This restriction is enforced by DRM. Your DVD player knows what region it's in. You're allowed to change the region code of the DVD player, but only twice; after that, the DVD player refuses to change its region.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this system is to allow film companies to sell DVDs cheaply in poor countries, but charge a lot more in rich countries. Without region coding, people would import DVDs from the poor countries and resell them here. Region coding can also be used to allow different versions of a film in different regions to account for different censorship rules, either about political views or about sexuality.</p>
        <p>This region coding system is protected by the DMCA, although in practice it is widely subverted, since DVD encoding was already broken before the DMCA. Arguments have been made that region coding violates free-trade treaties that disallow most restrictions on exporting goods from one country to another. It would definitely be a treaty violation if the US government had invented region coding, but since it's a creation of private companies, the question has not been settled. But the DMCA itself can be seen as the government enforcing the region coding.</p>

                <li>People in poor countries have more limited access to technology than people in rich countries. Look up the "Digital Divide" to find out about this problem. Do you think DVD (and Blu-Ray, by the way) region coding contributes to the digital divide?</li>
