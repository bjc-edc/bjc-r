        <h2>Copyright</h2>
        <div class="todo">I wonder if it might lead to better conversations if we asked, "Who thinks it's okay to download... without paying for it?" than "Who thinks it's okay to steal..." which sounds like a trick question. --MF, 12/16/18</div>
        
 		<div class="learn">
        	<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will learn about copyright: its history, what kinds of copying are legal or illegal, how technology has changed copyright issues, and how copyright is enforced with software.</p>
        	<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will discuss and reflect on your own opinions about copying other people's creative work.</p>
        </div>
        
 <!--       <div class="todo">JK: I'm really not sure what to do here. I'm tempted to put the next 4 pages into "supplemental materials" as one option for students to read. The other option students might read is BtB chapter 6. Another alternative would be for students to do their own web research. The biggest problem is that the next four pages contain barely anything for students to do (except read). <br>
        One idea is for students to grapple with specific ideas. - It should be legal to download a song from a CD you've purchased. - Um... something about the fines people have for downloading music and their fairness/is it really right to think of these as "lost profit" for the music industry? - Um... something about remixing songs (which I know nothing about) and some of the legal issues? - Something about thinking about websites or other sources of music students are familiar with and thinking through why they have some of the restrictions they have? <br>
        I also thought of maybe having students make posters (or something) about "what you need to know about copyright" for their schools. One thing would be to make sure that students are looking up the licensing of the images they use on their poster - that's one way to introduce the idea of the Creative Commons license. <br>
        (I'll keep this in the "todo" box for now since it's really draft-y)
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        <ol>
        	<li>Do some research about copyright to help you discuss the following issues:
            	<ul>
                	<li>copyright vs creativity</li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
                Some possible sources for research include:
                <ul>
                	<li>(link to Brian's pages)</li>
                    <li>Blown to bits Chapter 6</li>
                    <li>websites... RIAA? EFF sites, teachingcopyright.org (from EFF) that has a curriculum? - this includes an entire mock trial. Also includes a "fair use FAQ" (and video https://www.teachingcopyright.org/handouts/a-fair(y)-use-tale) and "copyright FAQ" that are intersting. I also like the "stakeholders worksheet" activity. There's also a true/false copyright quiz that I think teachers would like to use.</li>
                    <li>Watched this: http://www.ted.com/talks/larry_lessig_says_the_law_is_strangling_creativity - potentially offensive Jesus video for schools... but an interesting idea as to whether having an expectation of breaking the law all the time regarding copyright leads is a corrupting influence...Or maybe enough to just watch this video? http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/fair-use/videos/podcasts/remix-culture</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        </div>
 -->       
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Do a show-of-hands survey of the class:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who has music on their phone or computer that they didn't pay for (or download from a legitimate free distributor)?</li>
                        <li>Who has movies on their phone or computer that they didn't get legally?</li>
                        <li>Who has games on their phone or computer that they didn't get legally?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now a different kind of question:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who thinks it's okay to steal music?</li>
                        <li>Who thinks it's okay to steal movies?</li>
                        <li>Who thinks it's okay to steal games?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair.png" alt="Talk with Another Pair" title="Talk with Another Pair" />
                <li>If your class is like most classes, the first set of questions got very different responses from the second set.  Discuss in small groups: Is it &quot;stealing&quot; to download artistic works without permission? Why or why not?</li>
        		<div class="takeNote">The <em>copyright</em> law makes it illegal for anyone to make copies of a work of art (a book, a painting, a song, etc.) or other writing without the permission of the author. There are exceptions, as you'll learn later in this lab.  Copyright isn't just for great creative works; if a friend sends you an email, strictly speaking you can't forward it to someone else without your friend's permission.</div>
            	<li>Discuss in small groups:  Suppose anyone were allowed to download any music, movies, etc., they want.  How would the artists (musicians, writers, producers, actors, and so on) support themselves?</li>
                <li>Write out your opinion on some of these copyright issues. How well does your own behavior match what you think society should do?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
		<p>Copyright violation is very different from <em>plagiarism,</em> which means <em>pretending that you wrote</em> someone else's work.  You can illegally copy someone's work but say it's theirs (copyright violation), or you can copy something that isn't protected by copyright because it was written a long time ago, and pretend it's yours (plagiarism).  They're both illegal.  Copyright is complicated, but it's easy to avoid plagiarism: Just give credit to whoever wrote the stuff you want to copy.</p>



<!--        <p>Well, at least when authors make up stories, <em>those</em> have to be unique strokes of genius, right? There weren't bunches of writers in the 1990s all writing stories about a nerdy boy whose relatives hate him but who turns out to be a great wizard, who goes to a school for wizards in a magic place that non-wizards can't find, right?</p>
    	<p>Well, actually, yes, even earlier than the 1990s. For example, consider the <a href="http://www.ursulakleguin.com/Index-Earthsea.html" target="_blank">Earthsea</a> books by Ursula K. LeGuin, written 30 years earlier. The two sets of books are quite different in their details, storyline, and purposes, but they do share the similarities in the paragraph above. (If you liked Harry Potter and haven't read the Earthsea books, consider doing so.) There have been many, many retellings of stories from Shakespeare, who himself took story ideas from earlier writers. </p>
    	<p>That's why copyrights are different from patents. Patents cover a broad idea. If I have a patent on the telephone, you can't sell a device for carrying on conversations over long distances, even if it works entirely differently from the one I built. If cell phones had been invented during the actual telephone patent's years of validity, only AT&amp;T, Bell's company, would have been allowed to manufacture and sell them.</p>
    	<p>But copyrights protect only the <em>actual words</em> of a particular writer&mdash;or the actual notes of the music, or whatever is covered by a copyright. It's perfectly okay for you to write a story about wizardry students, as long as they aren't actually named Harry, Hermione, and so on, and they don't have adventures exactly like the ones in the Harry Potter books.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Don't try to be too lawyerish about this.  You can't get around copyright by translating the words into Spanish, or Pig Latin, or whatever.  If what you write clearly came from what the copyright holder wrote, you're in trouble.</div>
    	<p>(The same line of reasoning, by the way, also explains something you may have found arbitrary: that your teachers complain of cheating if you copy and paste Wikipedia articles into your paper, but are happy if you reword differently what Wikipedia says. It's the words, not the ideas, that have to be your own.) </p>
