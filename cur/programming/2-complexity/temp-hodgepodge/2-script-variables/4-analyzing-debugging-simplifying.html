              <li>REVISION NOTES: see U2L2.3 --- move this page (and U2L2.3) to separate lab on analyzing, debugging, simplifying. Explain why simplification  is important. It's about understanding how code works and what functions can return. Many students need time and/or a discussion before they appreciate this case. Otherwise, they just ignore it.</li>

                        <li>The block specs should be written to show that there is a numeric input in the function. (Students might not know how to set input types in Snap! yet, but we should always show them the correct way.)</li>
                    
            </li>
                <li>make the scripts that we're supposed to click on actually clickable</li>
				<li>the pictures do not open new windows when clicked as the text box says</li>
                <li>Items did not link to anywhere, using chrome?<br />Click on any of the pictures to go to a Snap file containing the code.</li>
                <li>intoduce a clear substitution for "if" blocks (<strong>PG:</strong> what does this mean?!)</li>

                <li>You already wrote and tested <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/sum-fromatob-170x27.png"  alt="sum from a to b">. 
		<p>Here are two buggy versions written by other programmers. Imagine you are helping these programmers debug their code. Show exactly where, in <em>their</em> code, a small fix (or two) will make it work correctly and be ready to <em>explain</em> why their code didn't work.</p>

		    	<img class="imageRight" alt="max block being executed" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/max-block-executed-BYOB.jpg" />
        		<li>It is useful to have a <code>max</code> block <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/max.png"> that takes two numbers as input and  tells which is bigger (the maximum). Four versions of <code>max</code> are shown below, two that <em>report</em> the max value, and two commands that <em>say</em> the max value. One of them doesn't work quite right. .

                        <li>With your pair programmer, explain why that one is the <em>only</em> one that doesn't work.</li>
