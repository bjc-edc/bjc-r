                    	<li>Variables do not have types. <em>Data</em> have types. Any variable can hold any datum, regardless of type. Also, Snap<em>!</em> is not Scratch -- lists are not comparable to variables; they're comparable to numbers or procedures. --BH</li>

<!--        <p>A <strong>data type</strong> is a label that specifies what type of data a variable can hold. In some programming languages, there are different data types for numbers than for words&mdash;or even for different kinds of numbers (for instance, integers vs. decimals). In Snap<em>!</em>, there are variables (which each hold one piece of data that can be either a number or text) and lists (which hold multiple pieces of data&mdash;numbers or text). We can also create our own data types to help clarify our code.</p>  -->
		<div class="learn">
			<strong>On this page</strong> you will create a new data type, <code>point</code>, to make your code even more flexible and easier to read, debug, and use.  
        </div>

        <p>Just as the name suggests, a <strong>data type</strong> is  what <em>kind</em> of data something is. Every kind of information in the computer is stored as a sequence of 0s and 1s (<strong>binary sequence</strong>). For a program to work, the computer needs to know whether to interpret any such sequence as a number, as text, as a list, or as something else....</p>
        <p>Each programming language provides some <strong>primitive</strong> (built in) <strong>data types</strong>. In Snap<em>!</em> the primitive types are <em>number</em>, <em>text string</em>, <em>Boolean</em>, <em>list</em>, <em>sprite</em>, <em>command</em>, <em>reporter</em>, and <em>predicate</em>.  (You haven't used all of these as data yet). This is the information the <em>computer</em> needs in order to interpret sequences of 0s and 1s. You can get a reminder of Snap<em>!</em>'s primitive types from the pull-down menu of the <code>is () a ()?</code> block.</p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Abstract</em> data types</strong> (or ADTs) are for people, not for the computer. You (the programmer) create them to make your program easier for <em> people</em> to read, debug, improve, and use. On this page, you will build a <code>point</code> data type to clean up your U2L2-DrawShape project.</li>

        	<div class="stagedir">Gamal joins Betsy and Alphie's <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/2-the-for-each-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">  discussion about using a list of coordinates to make a drawing of a letter</a>.</div>
        	<div><span>Gamal:</span> I was looking at our <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/go-to-point().png" height="40" alt="go-to-point()"> block and thought of a way to make it much easier to read.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Yeah, expressions like <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item(2)of-coordinates.png" width="249" height="28" alt="item(2)of-coordinates"> can  get confusing! Even after I wrote it to mean &quot;the <em>y</em> coordinate of the point,&quot; I had to think twice to make sure that the input was <em>one point</em>, instead of the whole list of coordinates of the letter A.</div>
			<div><span>Gamal:</span> That's the point! (Sorry about the pun.) <div class="sidenote">Gamal's idea is called <strong>data abstraction</strong>: creating a new abstract data type so that the detailed representation of the type is hidden from its users. In this case, users of points don't have to know that they're represented as lists.</div> 
			<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item(2)of-coordinates.png" alt="item(2)of-coordinates"> gives us a number, the <em>y</em>-coordinate, if  <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinates_input.png" alt="coordinates_input"> is just a list of two numbers, but gives us a <em>point</em>—a <em>list</em> of  two numbers—if <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinates_input.png" alt="coordinates_input"> is a list of points. Let's define a new <em>data type</em> called <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point()().png" alt="point () ()" title="point () ()" /> that contains an <em>x</em>-coordinate and a <em>y</em>-coordinate so that we can use  <br /> 
			<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point-list-for-A.png" height="80" alt="point-list-for-A"> <br />  instead of <br /> <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinate-list-for-A.png"  alt="coordinate-list-for-A">.</div>
			
<div class="stagedir">
                Gamal has built this block: 
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point.png" alt="point = list" title="point = list"/>
            </div>
			<div><span>Betsy:</span> That block is trivial; it isn't going to make the rest of the program any shorter. <code>Point</code> does the same thing as <code>list</code>!</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> Yes, but it is going to make the program easier to read and <em>easier to think about</em>. Now, a list of points will actually look like a list of points:</div>
            <div class="stagedir"><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/list-of-points.png" alt="letter A as list of points" title="letter A as list of points" /></div>
            <div class="endnote">Gamal's <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point()().png" alt="point () ()" title="point () ()" /> block is called the <strong>constructor</strong> for the abstract data type <code>point</code>  because it <em>constructs</em> (and reports) the list of assigned inputs (in this case, the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates for a point).</div>
            <div>
   	    <span>Betsy:</span> Hmmm... So we could also make <code>X coordinate</code> and <code>Y coordinate</code> blocks so that the <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/go-to-point().png" height="40" alt="go-to-point()"> block  would use code like <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/Y-coordinate-of-(coordinates).png" alt="Y-coordinate-of-(coordinates)"> instead of <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item(2)of(coordinates).png" alt="Y-coordinate-of-(coordinates)">, which was confusing too. </div>
