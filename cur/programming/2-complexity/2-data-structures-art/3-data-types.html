<!--        <p>A <strong>data type</strong> is a label that specifies what type of data a variable can hold. In some programming languages, there are different data types for numbers than for words&mdash;or even for different kinds of numbers (for instance, integers vs. decimals). In Snap<em>!</em>, there are variables (which each hold one piece of data that can be either a number or text) and lists (which hold multiple pieces of data&mdash;numbers or text). We can also create our own data types to help clarify our code.</p>  -->
		<div class="learn">
			<strong>On this page</strong> you will create a new data type, <code>point</code>, to make your U2L2-DrawShape code even more flexible and easier to read, debug, and use.

        <p>Just as the name suggests, a <strong>data type</strong> is  what <em>kind</em> of data something is. <em>Every</em> kind of information in the computer—whether it is a number, text, list, or an instruction to perform—is stored as a sequence of 0s and 1s (a <strong>binary sequence</strong>). So, for a program to work, the computer needs to be told how to interpret any such sequence of 0s and 1s.</p>
    <p>Each programming language provides some <strong>primitive</strong> (meaning "built in") <strong>data types</strong>. In Snap<em>!</em> the primitive types are <em>number</em>, <em>text string</em>, <em>list</em>, and some other types you haven't yet used  as data. (The <code>is () a ()?</code> block's pull-down menu shows all of Snap<em>!</em>'s primitive types.)</p>
        <p>
            The word "abstract" often sounds as if it means something <em>harder</em> to understand, but in Computer Science, its meaning is almost the opposite. <strong><em>Abstract</em> data types</strong> (or ADTs) are things that you, the programmer, create to make your program easier for <em>people</em> to read, debug, improve, and use. </li>

        	<div><span>Gamal:</span> I was looking at our <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/go-to-point().png" height="40" alt="go-to-point()"> block and thought of a way to make it much easier to read.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Yeah, expressions like <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item(2)of-coordinates.png" alt="item(2)of-coordinates"> can  get confusing! Even after I wrote it to mean &quot;the <em>y</em> coordinate of the point,&quot; I had to think twice to make sure that the input was <em>one point</em>, instead of the whole list of coordinates of the letter A.</div>
            <div class="todo">ST-The following part about "coordinates" is confusing.  We should stick to what we mean by it -coordinates of a single point-, rather than how else its could interpreted as a list of points.</div>
			<div><span>Gamal:</span> That's the point! (Sorry about the pun.) <div class="sidenote">Gamal's idea is called <strong>data abstraction</strong>: creating a new abstract data type to hide the details from its users. In this case, users of points don't have to know that they're represented as lists.</div> 
			<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item(2)of-coordinates.png" alt="item(2)of-coordinates"> gives us a number, the <em>y</em>-coordinate, if  <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinates_input.png" alt="coordinates_input"> is just a list of two numbers, but gives us a <em>point</em>—a <em>list</em> of  two numbers—if <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinates_input.png" alt="coordinates_input"> is a list of points. Let's define a new <em>data type</em> called <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point()().png" alt="point () ()" title="point () ()" /> that contains an <em>x</em>-coordinate and a <em>y</em>-coordinate so that we can use  <br /> 
			<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point-list-for-A.png" height="80" alt="point-list-for-A"> <br />  instead of <br /> <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinate-list-for-A.png"  alt="coordinate-list-for-A">.</div>

                Gamal has built this block:

            </div>
			<div><span>Betsy:</span> That block is trivial; it isn't going to make the rest of the program any shorter. <code>Point</code> does the same thing as <code>list</code>!</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> Yes, but it is going to make the program easier to read and <em>easier to think about</em>. Now, a list of points will actually look like a list of points:</div>

            <div class="endnote">Gamal's <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point()().png" alt="point () ()" title="point () ()" /> block is called the <strong>constructor</strong> for the abstract data type <code>point</code> because it <em>constructs</em> (and reports) the abstract value (in this case, a point made from its <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates).</div>
            <div>
   	    <span>Betsy:</span> Hmmm... So we could also make <code>X coordinate</code> and <code>Y coordinate</code> blocks so that the <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/go-to-point().png" height="40" alt="go-to-point()"> block  would use code like <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/Y-coordinate-of-(coordinates).png" alt="Y-coordinate-of-(coordinates)"> instead of <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item(2)of(coordinates).png" alt="Y-coordinate-of-(coordinates)">, which was confusing too. </div>
