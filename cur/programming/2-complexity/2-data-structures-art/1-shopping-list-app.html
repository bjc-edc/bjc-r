        <div class="todo">BH, I've made significant revisions. The previous version is <a href="https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-introduction-to-lists/old/1-shopping-list-app.html">here</a>. --MF, 3/21/19</div>

                ...in an organized way so that it's easy to program with and your code is easy debug. To do this, you will use problem decomposition&mdash;breaking down the problem into smaller pieces.</div> </p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will create a shopping list app. </p>

        <div class="sidenote">Some programming languages use the word <strong>array</strong> instead of "list." <div class="todo">...for their <em>sequence</em> data type.</div></div>
        <p>
            Many computer applications—contact lists, playlists, calendars, reminders—involve manipulating <em>lists</em> of information using tools that search, sort, or change the items on the list. You've worked with lists before as you customized the gossip project.<br />

            <h4>Move to next page where they first see lists of lists? --MF, 3/21/19</h4>
            Lists can contain letters or words, as you've seen before; lists, as you'll see in this lab; or even blocks, as you'll see in Unit 6. 
            <div class="endnote">For an optional preview using blocks in a list: open Snap<em>!</em>, choose Open... from the File menu, press the Examples button on the left of the window that opens, and explore the Vee project.</div>

            <h4>Do we need this on this page or should it be on the next page where they actually use <code>item of</code>?

            When you used <strong>map</strong> with lists in Unit 1, it worked with <em>all</em> the items in a list. You can also select a specific item in a list by specifying its <em>position</em> by  number. That number is called the <strong>index</strong>.<br />
