            <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will create tools for storing and accessing data.</p>

            Many computer applications—contact lists, playlists, calendars, reminders—involve manipulating <em>lists</em> of information using tools that search, sort, or change the items on the list. You've worked with lists before as you customized the gossip project.<br />

		<h3>Functional Programming</h3>

		<p>In the language used on the exam, the only way to generate list data is with <em>commands,</em> actions that <em>change</em> the contents of a list: <code>Add</code>. <code>Insert</code>. <code>Replace</code>. <code>Delete</code>.  They take this approach because they think it's the easiest programming style for you to understand, and also to include Scratch, in which these commands are the only mechanism provided for working with lists.  But there's a better way, called <strong>functional programming</strong>, in which you never modify a data structure, but instead make a new one to hold the new values.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="10">
				<li>You have a shopping list, and you want to have the plurals of all the foods.  (You're going to buy some apples, not one apple.)  The initial value of <var>shopping list</var> is <code>{apple, banana}</code>.  Consider these five scripts:
				<ol type="A">
					<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plurals-1.png"></li>
					<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plurals-2.png"></li>
					<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plurals-3.png"></li>
					<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plurals-4a.png"><br />
					    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plurals-4b.png"></li>
					<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plurals-5.png"></li>
				</ol>
				You haven't met <code>map</code> yet.  It's a higher order function that creates a new list, the same length as its input list, in which each item is computed by applying its input function to the corresponding item of the input list.
				<ol type="a">
				<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png">
					<li>After each of these scripts, what is the value of <var>plural shopping list</var>?</li>
					<li>After each of these scripts, what is the value of <var>shopping list</var>?
				</ol>
			</li>
		</div>
		<p>The point of that exercise is that for the first three scripts, the <em>imperative programming</em> ones, it takes careful attention to be sure what the final value of <var>shopping list</var> is.  (In one case it's the same as before; in one case it's the same as <var>plural shopping list</var>; in one case the answer depends on whether you're programming in Snap<i>!</i> or in AP-language.  (See the gray box just before the "Functional Programming" header.)</p>
		<p>By contrast, in the last two scripts it should be easy to see that no change is made to <var>shopping list</var>.  That's because these last two scripts use functional programming style:  You create a new list without any <code>replace</code> or <code>add</code> instructions.</p>
		<p>You have to recognize the imperative programming style for the exam.  (You will not be asked to <em>write</em> code on the exam.)  But you should also be comfortable with the functional style.  in particular, we hope you'll enjoy the elegance of the fifth script, a one-liner that creates the list of plurals without changing the original list.</p>
		<div class="takeNote">At one time, functional programming was viewed by "real" programmers as something of interest only to computer science professors.  But today it's a favored way to program because of parallel-processing hardware, either with both racks full of computers or with multicore processor chips that include four or eight processors inside a single chip.  The reason is that with multiple processes running in parallel, it's possible for two of them to be trying to modify the same variable at the same time, with bad results.  But if the program is written functionally, nothing is ever modified, so that can't happen.  There are <em>functional languages</em> in which there are no equivalents to <code>set</code> or <code>replace</code>.
