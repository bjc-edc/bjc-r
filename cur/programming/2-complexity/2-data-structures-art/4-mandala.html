        <div class="todo">ST- The pink box does not work for me.  Quoting Brian from Brickwall "The point of the pink box at the top of a page is not to walk through every single step of the project in detail. It's to say what
the finished product will be, and why you (kid) might be interested in it."  <br />Also aesthtically I am not a big fan of mixing images and text on the same line, it creates a very uneven visual form.</div>
        <div class="learn">
<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Mandala_img/Mandala3.png" height="200" alt="Mandala Ring" title="Mandala Ring"/>uses ten small copies of <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Mandala_img/10-gon-with-diagonals.png" height="140" alt="10-gon-with-diagonals" title="10-gon-with-diagonals" />, which is just <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Mandala_img/10-gon.png" height="140" alt="10-gon" title="10-gon" /> with all of its diagonals. You've drawn polygons before. Instead of having to figure out all the angles for the diagonals, you will draw the polygon and <em>save</em> the coordinates of its vertices in a list. Then you can use the same techniques  you used earlier to connect the dots in the list.<br /> 
            You will start by drawing <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Mandala_img/10-gon-with-diagonals.png" height="140" alt="10-gon-with-diagonals" title="10-gon-with-diagonals" />. Then you can create your own variations.<br />

           <div class="todo">ST-If they used abstraction as we asked them to do in U1 and got polygon from pinwheel, this "adding code" may not be so obvious how to do.  I wonder if the alternative polygon code should be given/hinted here.</div>
           <div>
          
            <span>Betsy:</span> We could add code to our <code>polygon</code> block so that it stores the location of each vertex <em>while</em> it draws the polygon.

           <div>
           	<span> Gamal:</span> In the script we wrote to learn players' names, we used <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/add()to().png" height="44" alt="add()to()"> to put them in a list. That might work here, too.</div>
           <div class="todo">ST-This next paragraph is confusing for me.  It is not clear why they will not employ the "point" data type they developed.</div>
            <div class="stagedir">
           	  <p>The three think a while and build and try out some code. They don't find a way to get their list of vertices to have green <code>point</code> blocks in it, but they do get a list that contains <code>list</code> blocks that contain the right vertices.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
           	 <span> Gamal:</span> Well, that's good enough for now. Let's see if we can use that list to draw all the diagonals.
            </div>
            <div>
           	 <span> Betsy:</span> I have an idea.

           <div class="todo">ST-I wonder if nested "for each" block structure should be hinted here and more scaffolding might be needed.  I feel there are quite a few steps expected here that are not obvious, as connecting a set of points in order -what they have done- is quite different than connecting every point to every point.  For example they may worry that they should connect every point to every OTHER point -which is hard- not realizing that connecting a point to itself is OK.</div>
           <div>
           	 <span> Alphie:</span> Oh, and we should do what we did last time. Build a block that does <em>just</em> that much. Pick <em>one</em> vertex and use <code>for each</code> to connect <em>just that one</em> to each other vertex. Then we can work on using that block on each vertex.

                    In some cultures, mandalas  are seen as symbols of interconnectedness and harmony.  Do some research on Mandalas as created and viewed by different cultures and present your finding to your classmates. Try creating some.<br />
