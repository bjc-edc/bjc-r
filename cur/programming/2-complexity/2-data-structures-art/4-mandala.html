       1.1.1A A creative process in the development of a computational artifact can include, but is not limited to, employing nontraditional, non-prescribed techniques; the use of novel combinations of artifacts, tools, and techniques; and the exploration of personal curiosities.<br />
       1.2.1A A computational artifact is anything created by a human using a computer and can be, but is not limited to, a program, an image, audio, video, a presentation, or a web page file.<br />
       1.2.1D A creatively developed computational artifact can be created by using nontraditional, non-prescribed computing techniques. <br />
       1.2.1E Creative expressions in a computational artifact can reflect personal expressions of ideas or interests. <br />
       1.2.3C Combining or modifying existing artifacts can show personal expression of ideas.<br />
       1.3.1C Digital images can be created by generating pixel patterns, manipulating existing digital images, or combining images. <br />
       5.1.1B Programs developed for creative expression, to satisfy personal curiosity, or to create new knowledge may have visual, audible, or tactile inputs and outputs. <br />
       5.5.1H Computational methods may use lists and collections to solve problems. <br />

            <div><span>Betsy:</span> So let's make our <code>polygon</code> block  store 
      <!--the location of--> each vertex as a <code>point</code> <em>while</em> it draws the polygon. We  listed  points as <em>we</em> clicked on them. This is the same, but with the <em>program</em> generating the points.</div>
            <div><span> Gamal:</span> Right! Set up a empty list variable first, and then use <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/add()to().png" height="44" alt="add() to ()" title="add() to ()" /> inside the <code>polygon</code> block.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Global variable or a  script variable?</div>
            <div><span> Gamal:</span> Well, we need to use it inside <code>polygon</code> <em>and</em> in the script that draws the mandala, so I'd make it global so multiple scripts can access it.</div>

I feel there are quite a few steps expected here that are not obvious, as connecting a set of points in order -what they have done- is quite different than connecting every point to every point.  For example they may worry that they should connect every point to every OTHER point -which is hard- not realizing that connecting a point to itself is OK.</div>   -->
            <div><span> Alphie:</span> Perfect! Pick <em>one</em> vertex and use <code>for each</code> to connect <em>just that one</em> to each other vertex.  After that, it's easy! We can use that block on <em>each</em> vertex.</div>

            Snap<em>!</em> has a <code>pause all</code> block which you can use to place breaks in your code and step through your code at will. Click on the video below to start the animation.  Notice how the yellow Run/Pause button next to the Green Flag is used to step through the code.  In this simple example, there is only one script running. The reason it's called <code>pause all</code> is that if you have <em>multiple</em> scripts running, it will pause <em>all</em> of them until the yellow Run/Pause button is clicked.<br />
