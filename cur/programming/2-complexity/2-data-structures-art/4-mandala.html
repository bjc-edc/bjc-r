            1.1.1A A creative process in the development of a computational artifact can include, but is not limited to, employing nontraditional, non-prescribed techniques; the use of novel combinations of artifacts, tools, and techniques; and the exploration of personal curiosities.<br />
            1.2.1A A computational artifact is anything created by a human using a computer and can be, but is not limited to, a program, an image, audio, video, a presentation, or a web page file.<br />
            1.2.1D A creatively developed computational artifact can be created by using nontraditional, non-prescribed computing techniques. <br />
            1.2.1E Creative expressions in a computational artifact can reflect personal expressions of ideas or interests. <br />
            1.2.3C Combining or modifying existing artifacts can show personal expression of ideas.<br />
            1.3.1C Digital images can be created by generating pixel patterns, manipulating existing digital images, or combining images. <br />
            5.1.1B Programs developed for creative expression, to satisfy personal curiosity, or to create new knowledge may have visual, audible, or tactile inputs and outputs. <br />

            <p>PG: "On this page, you vill create a design called (by somebody) a 'mandala,' vether you vant to or not, and ve von't tell you why!" The design is beautiful, but we need to think what is to be /learned/ and we need to make that clear to the student."You can also save and use coordinates that are produced by /your program/." And "mandala" is not what this is called. Period. There are mandalas, this bears a resemblance and /could/ be called a mandala, but this is not "called a mandala."  TIF B is a callout to "cultures" but I'm not sure it can feel genuine.</p>
            <p>BH: Flush TIF B, add a (new first) TIF about eliminating the redundant segment drawing.</p>
            <p>MF: SCRAP.feels more like an optional project; is it needed? The debugging block is nice, as is the re-use of POLYGON, but it seems like an optional project</p>

			<h4><strong>Debugging with <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/pause-all-block.png"  height="42" alt="pause all" title="pause all"/></strong></h4>
			You can use <code>pause all</code> to place breaks in your code so you can see what's happening along the way. In this animation, the programmer runs their code with <code>pause all</code> inside it and then clicks the yellow Run/Pause button next to the Green Flag (<img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/play-button.png" alt="play button" title="play button"/>/<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pause_button.png" alt="pause button" title="pause button"/>) to move through the code up until a <code>pause</code> block is reached again. In this example, there is only one script running, but <code>pause all</code> will pause <em>every</em> script that is running until the yellow Run/Pause button is clicked.<br />
