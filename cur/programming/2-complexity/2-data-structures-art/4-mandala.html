        <h2>Mandala Designs</h2>
        <div class="learn">
        	This intricate design <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/Mandala3.png" height="240" alt="Mandala Ring" title="Mandala Ring"/> uses ten small copies of <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/10-gon-with-diagonals.png" height="160" alt="10-gon-with-diagonals" title="10-gon-with-diagonals" />, which is just <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/10-gon.png" height="160" alt="10-gon" title="10-gon" /> with all of its diagonals. <br /> 
            You will start by drawing <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/10-gon-with-diagonals.png" height="100" alt="10-gon-with-diagonals" title="10-gon-with-diagonals" />. Then you can create your own variations.<br />

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
            	<li>Discuss with your partner, to figure out a possible algorithm for drawing <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/10-gon-with-diagonals.png" height="100" alt="10-gon-with-diagonals" title="10-gon-with-diagonals" />.</li>

                    Here is one way to think about it:<br />

                        <li>
                            In Unit 1 Lab 3 page 5, problem 4, you created a block to draw a regular polygon. The example here is a decagon, a 10-sided polygon. <br />
                            <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/simple-polygon.png" height="120" alt="polygon, sides: (num of sides) sidelength: (length)">
                        </li>
                        <li>Instead of trying to figure out the angles for drawing each diagonal, change your <code>polygon</code> block so that it stores the location of each vertex <em>while</em> it draws the polygon.</li>
                        <li>Then, use ideas from the last two lab pages to draw segments from one vertex in that list to all the other vertices in that list.</li>

                        <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/Stage2.png" height="160" alt="Stage 2 of Mandala" title="Stage 2 of Mandala" />
                        <li>Apply that algorithm to each vertex.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <li>
                    Start by creating some custom blocks that will help keep track of important information.  The design is based on a set of evenly spaced points (the vertices of the polygon), so there needs to be a way to store the locations of these points.  First, create a reporter block that will store the given x and y coordinates of a point in a list.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/point.png" height="100" alt="Block point (x) (y)" title="Block point (x) (y)"/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then create the reporter blocks that will give access to the x and y coordinates of a given point.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/xPoint.png" height="100" alt="x coordinate of point (point)" title="x coordinate of point (point)" />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/yPoint.png" height="100" alt="y coordinate of point (point)" title="y coordinate of point (point)" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    A lot of segments will be drawn, so, create a custom block that will draw a segment between any two given points.  The following blocks may help.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/HintsForDrawSegment.png" height="250" alt="Hint blocks for drawing a segment" title="Hint blocks for drawing a segment"/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now everything needed is ready to create the custom block to draw the Mandala.  This block will have two inputs: number of sides of the polygon and the side length of the polygon used in the Mandala.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/MandalaHeader.png" height="85" alt="Mandala, sides:(number of sides) side length:(length)" title="Mandala, sides:(number of sides) side length:(length)" /><br />
                    Create a script variable <var>pointList</var> to keep track of the vertex points, initialize it to an empty list and store these points as they are visited during the traversing of the vertices of the regular polygon.  The following blocks may help.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/scriptVarInitialize.png" height="85" alt="Initialize script variable pointList" title="Initialize script variable pointList"/>

                </li>
                <!--<div class="endnote">
                	In case you have forgotten, the following picture may help you remember why a turn of 360/<var>number of sides</var> degrees is needed each time while traversing a regular polygon.<br />

                </div>-->
                <li>
                    Now, thanks to all the previous steps, the rest of the code will be straightforward.  A segment must be drawn from every vertex of the polygon to every vertex of the polygon. The following blocks may help.<br />

                    Note that <code>for each</code> block, which allows you to loop through each item of a list, is not available by default.  To make this block available you must “Import Tools” from the Snap<em>!</em> file menu and then look for it under the list related blocks.<br />

                    In many cultures, Mandala and its variations are celebrated as symbols of “interconnectedness” and “harmony”.  Do some research on Mandalas as created and viewed by different cultures and present your finding to your classmates.  Can you create any of these with Snap<em>!</em> ?<br />
