        <div class="learn">
<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Mandala_img/Mandala3.png" height="200" alt="Mandala Ring" title="Mandala Ring"/>uses ten small copies of <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Mandala_img/10-gon-with-diagonals.png" height="140" alt="10-gon-with-diagonals" title="10-gon-with-diagonals" />, which is just <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Mandala_img/10-gon.png" height="140" alt="10-gon" title="10-gon" /> with all of its diagonals. You've drawn polygons before. Instead of having to figure out all the angles for the diagonals, you will draw the polygon and <em>save</em> the coordinates of its vertices in a list. Then you can use techniques like you used earlier to connect the dots in the list.<br /> 
            You will start by drawing <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Mandala_img/10-gon-with-diagonals.png" height="140" alt="10-gon-with-diagonals" title="10-gon-with-diagonals" />. Then you can create your own variations.<br />

            <span>Betsy:</span> We could add code to our <code>polygon</code> block so that it stores the location of each vertex <em>while</em> it draws the polygon.

           	<span> Gamal:</span> In the script we wrote to learn players' names, we used <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/add()to().png" height="44" alt="add()to()"> to put them in a list. That might work here, too.</div>

           	  <p>The three think a while and build and try out some code. They don't find a way to get their list of vertices to have green <code>point</code> blocks in it, but they do get a list that contains <code>list</code> blocks that contain the right vertices.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
           	 <span> Gamal:</span> Well, that's good enough for now. Let's see if we can use that list to draw all the diagonals.

           <div>
           	 <span> Alphie:</span> Oh, and we should do what we did last time. Build a block that does <em>just</em> that much. Pick <em>one</em> vertex and use <code>for each</code> to connect <em>just that one</em> to each other vertex. Then we can work on using that block on each vertex.

                    In some cultures, mandalas  are seen as symbols of interconnectedness and harmony.  Do some research on Mandalas as created and viewed by different cultures and present your finding to your classmates. Try creating some.<br />
