            <!--        <div class="todo">ST-I wonder if nested "for each" block structure should be hinted here and more scaffolding might be needed.  I feel there are quite a few steps expected here that are not obvious, as connecting a set of points in order -what they have done- is quite different than connecting every point to every point.  For example they may worry that they should connect every point to every OTHER point -which is hard- not realizing that connecting a point to itself is OK.</div>   -->
            <div class="commentBig">This last line by Alphie does not makes sense to me, so I'm not sure how to revise it. Can we cut back the number of words and remove the excessive use of "just"? Also, when is "last time"? U1L3 when we built this block? --MF, 5/18/17</div>
            <div><span> Alphie:</span> Perfect! That's just what we did last time. We'll build a block that does <em>just</em> that much. Pick <em>one</em> vertex and use <code>for each</code> to connect <em>just that one</em> to each other vertex.  After that, it's easy! We just figure out how to use that block on each vertex.</div>
            <div class="todo">ST- I believe nested <code>for each</code> blocks might be simpler to use than the recommended method of creating a new block (to draw diagonals from a single vertex) due to the input parameters that would have to be passed which may confuse kids.</div>
