        <h2>Click to Draw</h2>
  <!--      <div class="todo">ST-I don't think this page belongs here.  This will not help the students for the task they need to prepare for, the Mandala.  It may belong to U3 if we end up doing the "simple studio" project (my interview submission) for which this could be a prelude.  Also looking at your solution, I see some non-trivial steps, -not just the recursive "all of" predicate, but overall subtle sequencing of code-  I don't see how the kids will succeed with this little help.</div>   -->
   <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong> you'll make the list of points for a letter (or other shape) by writing a program to collect the points at which you click the mouse into a list, instead of typing point coordinates in yourself.</div>
   <div class="dialogue">
   <div class="todo">
     <p>ST-Suggested replacement:".....Why can't we just draw a letter on the screen by clicking on the corner points that define the letter?"</p>
     <p>Again, I don't think it's realistic to click on the screen freehand. On the previous page they drew their A on graph paper first. --bh</p>
   </div>
  
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Typing in all these coordinates is a pain.  Why can't we just draw the letters on the screen, and then click on the endpoints of the lines?</div>
             <!--<div class="todo">
               <p>ST-This next comment by Betsy feels a bit unrealistic, no one will try to draw on a screen or use tracing paper on a screen.<br />Suggestion: Betsy: "Great idea, how could we do that?"</p>
               <p>Selim: If you look at my ugly, ragged E, it's that way because I just eyeballed the vertices instead of having an actual printed E to work from. On the previous page, they draw an A on graph paper before entering the coordinates. I think it's absolutely realistic that kids would hold that graph in front of the screen to get the vertices right! --bh</p>
             </div>-->
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Umm, I think we'll get in trouble if we draw on the screen.  But we could draw on <em>tracing paper</em> (so we can still see the mouse cursor) and hold the picture up to the screen.</div>
<div><span>Alphie:</span> We'll have to write a block that keeps waiting for a mouse click, and then adds the mouse click coordinates to a list.  When all the points have been entered, the block should report the list of points.</div>
             <p><img class="imageLeft" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/E.gif" width="183" height="318" alt="Entering points for E"></p>              <p>&nbsp;</p>
             <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(At the end of the movie, you'll see that Alphie and Betsy have used a click outside the stage to indicate the end of the shape.)

<div class="todo">
  <p>ST- It will be confusing for many kids that "list of points" block, which does many things like the coordinate collection and the drawing, is not a command block but a reporter.  This is a subtle but big step up as they have never seen a reporter block doing things that a command block does.  They will wonder why it needs to report anything at all as the intended letter is fully drawn on the stage. </p>
  <p>Is this better? --bh</p>
  <p>ST-As far as I can tell the only change is the question you posed to the kids about the reporter in #2.  I believe they need more of an explanation 1) that reporters can do more than reporting, 2)why the list of points need to be reported at all.  These are completely non-trivial in my humble view.</p>
  <p>For (1), I think the code picture makes it clear that reporters can do stuff! And for (2), I don't want to give that point away without an opportunity for kids to discuss it. They've already experienced, on the previous page, wanting to draw a letter more than once, so they /should/ already be able to answer this. --bh</p>

  <li>Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2L2-click-points.xml">this starter project</a>. It includes the following skeleton block definition.   <br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/list-points-starter.png" alt="starter for LIST OF POINTS"><br />
  The starter project contains some helper blocks you've already defined (<code>go to point</code>, <code>draw from point to point</code>, <code>Y coordinate of</code>, etc.) and some others you'll need (<code>wait for click</code>, and <code>click on stage?</code>). The sprite's costume is a  dot.</li>
    <li>                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
<strong>Think and write: </strong>Start by <em>reading</em> the starter code and try to understand its structure.  For example:
      <ul>
        <li>Why is it a reporter? Since it draws the shape as you click on its corners, isn't the job done? Why should it report a value?</li>
        <li>It uses a <code>forever</code> block.  When, and how, does it report a value?</li>
    <li>What is the <code>if else</code> block testing, and why?</li>
    <li>Can you use a script variable for the list inside <code>list of points</code>, or does it have to be global?    </li></ul></li>
  <li>Finish writing <code>list of points</code> so that it collects points from mouse clicks and reports the list when it is finished.  You will use it this way: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/e-from-points.png" alt="set (E) to (list of points)"> <div class="narrower">To do that,   you will replace each <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/stuff-here.png" alt="you write stuff in here"> with the code you need at that point to implement the algorithm. You will also need to supply all missing input values.</div> 
  <br />
  <ol type="a">
    <li><div class="comment">Paul, I know you prefer "like" to "such as," but this is a case in which I misinterpreted an ambiguous sentence (to mean "just like visual details"). --bh</div>Focus mainly on learning how to write code that collects points into a list: You'll use that knowledge often. (Fancy touches, such as visual details, are optional but not important  now.)</li>

    <li>To collect data, you need to start with an empty list. You will add a point for each mouse click.</li>
    <li>The <code>stamp</code> block is built into Snap<em>!</em>. It puts a picture of the sprite's costume on the stage at the sprite's location.</li>
    <div class="takeNote"><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Notice how convenient it is to have <code>point</code>, <code>Y coordinate of</code>, <code>go to point</code>, <code>draw from point to point</code>, etc., already built to use the <strong>point</strong> abstract data type. Once you've created a point from the mouse coordinates, you never have to think about coordinates again in this activity. </div>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Think and write:</strong> What would this code look like if you had just used Snap<em>!</em>'s primitive blocks without having first defined the abstract data type <strong>point</strong> and blocks like <code>go to point</code> that use it?</li>
