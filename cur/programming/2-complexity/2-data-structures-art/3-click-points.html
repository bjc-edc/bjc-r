        <h2>Capturing Clicks to Draw</h2>
  <!--      <div class="todo">ST-I don't think this page belongs here.  This will not help the students for the task they need to prepare for, the Mandala.  It may belong to U3 if we end up doing the "simple studio" project (my interview submission) for which this could be a prelude.  Also looking at your solution, I see some non-trivial steps, -not just the recursive "all of" predicate, but overall subtle sequencing of code-  I don't see how the kids will succeed with this little help.</div>   -->

On the previous page, you drew a shape based on a list of points we gave you.  <strong>On this page,</strong> you will automate the process of getting coordinates by clicking on the desired points on the screen.

                <p>ST-Suggested replacement:".....Why can't we just draw a letter on the screen by clicking on the corner points that define the letter?"</p>
                <p>Again, I don't think it's realistic to click on the screen freehand. On the previous page they drew their A on graph paper first. --bh</p>

            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Typing in all these coordinates is a pain.  Why can't we just draw the letters on the screen, and then click on the endpoints of the lines?</div>
             <!--<div class="todo">
               <p>ST-This next comment by Betsy feels a bit unrealistic, no one will try to draw on a screen or use tracing paper on a screen.<br />Suggestion: Betsy: "Great idea, how could we do that?"</p>
               <p>Selim: If you look at my ugly, ragged E, it's that way because I just eyeballed the vertices instead of having an actual printed E to work from. On the previous page, they draw an A on graph paper before entering the coordinates. I think it's absolutely realistic that kids would hold that graph in front of the screen to get the vertices right! --bh</p>
             </div>-->
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Umm, I think we'll get in trouble if we draw on the screen.  But we could draw on <em>tracing paper</em> (so we can still see the mouse cursor) and hold the picture up to the screen. We'll have to write a block that keeps waiting for a mouse click, and then adds those mouse coordinates to a list.  When all the points have been entered, the block should report the list of points.<br />

                    <p>ST- It will be confusing for many kids that "list of points" block, which does many things like the coordinate collection and the drawing, is not a command block but a reporter.  This is a subtle but big step up as they have never seen a reporter block doing things that a command block does.  They will wonder why it needs to report anything at all as the intended letter is fully drawn on the stage. </p>
                    <p>Is this better? --bh</p>
                    <p>ST-As far as I can tell the only change is the question you posed to the kids about the reporter in #2.  I believe they need more of an explanation 1) that reporters can do more than reporting, 2)why the list of points need to be reported at all.  These are completely non-trivial in my humble view.</p>
                    <p>For (1), I think the code picture makes it clear that reporters can do stuff! And for (2), I don't want to give that point away without an opportunity for kids to discuss it. They've already experienced, on the previous page, wanting to draw a letter more than once, so they /should/ already be able to answer this. --bh</p>

                <div class="todo">
                    <p><strong>Why not let them <em>try</em> to finish it as #1?</strong> Then #2 will be more accessible because they've at least dug into the code and comments a bit more actively. I think this project is accessible enough for that, and I think that's what was troubling me before. I want to dig in right away and read the helpful comments as I go, not before. EBF, no? --MF, 5/19/17</p>
                    <p>Also, I edited the starter project to clarify the comments. --MF, 5/19/17</p>
                    <p>Fine with me. Actually we <em>do</em> tell them to try it in #1. When I made that list in #2, it was a set of hints, partly to make Selim happy. Someone else made it a &quot;think and write.&quot; Can I just flush the think and write part? (I always hated those as a kid, every kid I know hates them, and I still hate them as a writer.) --bh</p>

                    <!--<div class="comment">I find this image and the file overwhelming. There are so many comments and there are blocks out on the stage that it says we need to use, though some have already been used in the program, so it's not clear to me that I (as student) actually need to use them in my program still. It's also really hard to read and meaningfully analyze half-written code like this because I have to keep bouncing back and forth between the code and the comments. --MF, 5/18/17</div>-->

                    <strong>Think and write: </strong>Start by <em>reading</em> the code inside the <code>list of points</code> reporter, and try to understand its structure.  For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Why is it a reporter? Since it draws the shape as you click on its corners, isn't the job done? Why should it report a value?</li>
                        <li>It uses a <code>forever</code> block.  When, and how, does it report a value?</li>
                        <li>What is the <code>if else</code> block testing, and why?</li>
                        <li>Can you use a script variable for the list inside <code>list of points</code>, or does it have to be global?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="todo">
                        <p>I think the these questions (the first and fourth especially) will work better after trying to build the code. --MF, 5/19/17</p>
                        <!--<p>I agree that the "Why is it a reporter?" question is subtle, and when I first read this, I wasn't yet even sure how to answer it. I wrote: I assume it's so that we can input the list of points somewhere else, but we aren't doing that on this page, and it hasn't been mentioned on this page&mdash;in fact, this page doesn't appear (without reflection) to be connected to the rest of the lab at all. Perhaps we should say something about how this will connect to other pages in the pink box at the top? --MF, 5/18/17 &amp; 5/19 </p>
                        <p>The second and third questions seem answerable, though they might be tough to answer looking at this half-written code. --MF, 5/18/17 </p>-->
                        <p>The fourth question, like the first, feels less trivial, and I'm wanting more support on the student page&mdash;perhaps a link back to a L1 page and/or a takenote box following this problem?--MF, 5/18/17 </p>

                <li>
                    Finish writing <code>list of points</code> so that it collects points from mouse clicks and reports the list when it is finished.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Test your block several times and debug any problems.</li>
                        <li>Try saving the output of <code>list of points</code> and using your <code>draw points</code> to recreate the shape you drew. Debug any problems.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <div class="takeNote">
                    <p><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Notice how convenient it is to have <code>point</code>, <code>y coordinate of</code>, <code>go to point</code>, <code>draw from point to point</code>, etc., already built to use the <strong>point</strong> abstract data type. Once you've created a point from the mouse coordinates, you never have to think about coordinates again in this activity.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="todo">I'm unenthusiastic about this last problem.  Aside from the general awfulness of the category, this particular one, coming after the orange box above it, isn't really being honest about the "think" part since there is only one right answer.  And it puts way too much emphasis on a point made in passing.  If anything, it should be an honest assessment question, e.g., "<code>List of points</code> uses only the <code>point</code> constructor, not the selectors.  Why do you need selectors in this project?"</div>
              <li><strong>Think and write:</strong> Imagine how complicated your code would be if you didn't have these abstractions. What would this code look like without the abstract data type <strong>point</strong> and the blocks like <code>go to point</code> that use it?</li>
