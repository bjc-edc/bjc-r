            <p>This title still feels meaningless to me unless you already know what the lab is doing. I suggested "Coordinate Collector," which Brian didn't like, but I'm also ok with "Collecting Coordinates," and "Collecting Points by Clicking." Any better ideas? --MF, 5/18/17</p>
            <p>I know this page is new, and unfortunately, I think it shows. I worry that this project unwieldy and the page is too vague. I'd love to see some revisions and then review again tomorrow, if possible. --MF, 5/18/17</p>

  <!--      <div class="todo">ST-I don't think this page belongs here.  This will not help the students for the task they need to prepare for, the Mandala.  It may belong to U3 if we end up doing the "simple studio" project (my interview submission) for which this could be a prelude.  Also looking at your solution, I see some non-trivial steps, -not just the recursive "all of" predicate, but overall subtle sequencing of code-  I don't see how the kids will succeed with this little help.</div>   -->

               <p>ST-This next comment by Betsy feels a bit unrealistic, no one will try to draw on a screen or use tracing paper on a screen.<br />Suggestion: Betsy: "Great idea, how could we do that?"</p>
               <p>Selim: If you look at my ugly, ragged E, it's that way because I just eyeballed the vertices instead of having an actual printed E to work from. On the previous page, they draw an A on graph paper before entering the coordinates. I think it's absolutely realistic that kids would hold that graph in front of the screen to get the vertices right! --bh</p>

            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Umm, I think we'll get in trouble if we draw on the screen.  But we could draw on <em>tracing paper</em> (so we can still see the mouse cursor) and hold the picture up to the screen.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> We'll have to write a block that keeps waiting for a mouse click, and then adds the mouse click coordinates to a list.  When all the points have been entered, the block should report the list of points.</div>

            Alphie and Betsy develop code to implement their idea.<br />

                    <p>ST- It will be confusing for many kids that "list of points" block, which does many things like the coordinate collection and the drawing, is not a command block but a reporter.  This is a subtle but big step up as they have never seen a reporter block doing things that a command block does.  They will wonder why it needs to report anything at all as the intended letter is fully drawn on the stage. </p>
                    <p>Is this better? --bh</p>
                    <p>ST-As far as I can tell the only change is the question you posed to the kids about the reporter in #2.  I believe they need more of an explanation 1) that reporters can do more than reporting, 2)why the list of points need to be reported at all.  These are completely non-trivial in my humble view.</p>
                    <p>For (1), I think the code picture makes it clear that reporters can do stuff! And for (2), I don't want to give that point away without an opportunity for kids to discuss it. They've already experienced, on the previous page, wanting to draw a letter more than once, so they /should/ already be able to answer this. --bh</p>

                    <div class="comment">I find this image and the file overwhelming. There are so many comments and there are blocks out on the stage that it says we need to use, though some have already been used in the program, so it's not clear to me that I (as student) actually need to use them in my program still. It's also really hard to read and meaningfully analyze half-written code like this because I have to keep bouncing back and forth between the code and the comments. --MF, 5/18/17</div>

                    <strong>Think and write: </strong>Start by <em>reading</em> the code inside the <code>list of points</code> reporter, and try to understand its structure.  For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Why is it a reporter? Since it draws the shape as you click on its corners, isn't the job done? Why should it report a value?</li>
                        <li>It uses a <code>forever</code> block.  When, and how, does it report a value?</li>
                        <li>What is the <code>if else</code> block testing, and why?</li>
                        <li>Can you use a script variable for the list inside <code>list of points</code>, or does it have to be global?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="todo">
                        <p>I agree that the "Why is it a reporter?" question is subtle, and I'm not even sure I can answer it. I assume it's so that we can input the list of points somewhere else, but we aren't doing that on this page, and it hasn't been mentioned on this page&mdash;in fact, this page doesn't appear (without reflection) to be connected to the rest of the lab at all. Perhaps we should say something about how this will connect to other pages in the pink box at the top? --MF, 5/18/17 </p>
                        <p>The second and third questions seem answerable, though they might be tough to answer looking at this half-written code. --MF, 5/18/17 </p>
                        <p>The fourth question, like the first, feels less trivial, and I'm wanting more support on the student page&mdash;perhaps a link back to a L1 page and/or a takenote box following this problem?--MF, 5/18/17 </p>

                    <div class="commentBig">Aha! The goal is finally clarified here: "collects points from mouse clicks and reports the list when it is finished" This should be clearer from the start. Looking back at the pink box, I see that we try to say this there, but it's not as clear there as it finally is here. Having them read hard-to-read code before they understand this feels like we are making a puzzle. :/ --MF, 5/18/17</div>
                    Finish writing <code>list of points</code> so that it collects points from mouse clicks and reports the list when it is finished.  You will use it this way:<br />

                    <div class="todo">This image feels like too little too late. I'm wanting it earlier to explain what we are intending with this work, and I'm wanting more code: is this <code>set</code> instruction to be followed by <code>draw shape(</code><var>E</var><code>)</code>? --MF, 5/18/17</div> 
                    <div class="narrower">
                        <p>To do that, you will replace each <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/stuff-here.png" alt="you write stuff in here"> with the code you need at that point to implement the algorithm. You will also need to supply all missing input values.</p>
                        <div class="todo">I wanted this clarity earlier (like in #1). --MF, 5/18/17</div>

                        <li>To collect data, you need to start with an empty list. You will add a point for each mouse click.</li>
                        <li>The <code>stamp</code> block is built into Snap<em>!</em>. It puts a picture of the sprite's costume on the stage at the sprite's location.</li>

Point a seems to say "focus on the project"--unless there is some subsection of the code that we are supposed to be focusing on here...why are we saying this?

                            <p><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Notice how convenient it is to have <code>point</code>, <code>y coordinate of</code>, <code>go to point</code>, <code>draw from point to point</code>, etc., already built to use the <strong>point</strong> abstract data type. Once you've created a point from the mouse coordinates, you never have to think about coordinates again in this activity.</p>
                            <div class="todo">I'm not sure how well this kind of messaging works: "see how nice it is when this problem you didn't have to deal with is taken care of for you?" ;) Maybe phrasing it as "Imagine how complicated your code would be if you didn't have these abstractions. In place of these blocks, you would have unlabeled lists and <code>item of</code> blocks that you'd have to re-analyze each time you read." Obviously, that's not quite the right thing, but I'm trying to adjust the comparison from something you can't imagine (and so won't be very impressed about) to something they can imagine and can be grateful to have avoided. --MF, 5/18/17</div>

                            <p>Even this far down on the page, I'm still feeling overwhelmed by all the things they have to wrap their heads around here. The new block <code>draw from point to point</code> is simple, but it's new, and understanding it could easily get lost in the shuffle. I, myself, missed it completely until I got down to this orange box; there is too much to analyze in that project. Things need to be streamilned toward the code goals of this page, which apparently are "This page prepares for page 4, in which a list of points is generated automatically within a program. This page introduces a program-generated list in an easier context: The user clicks on a point, and the program adds that point to the list. This page also introduces the primitive stamp to draw a picture of the sprite at its current location on the stage. The page also reinforces the idea of data abstraction. On page 2, students created an ADT and used it to rewrite a program they'd already written. It's hard to make that convincing, but here they are writing entirely new code that's much easier because of the point abstraction." though those don't read like goals we have anywhere else and probably also need attention as I'm unclear on the goals myself still (make a program that does X, use stamp, and use data abstraction?). --MF, 5/18/17</p>
