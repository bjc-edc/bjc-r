  <!--      <div class="todo">ST-I don't think this page belongs here.  This will not help the students for the task they need to prepare for, the Mandala.  It may belong to U3 if we end up doing the "simple studio" project (my interview submission) for which this could be a prelude.  Also looking at your solution, I see some non-trivial steps, -not just the recursive "all of" predicate, but overall subtle sequencing of code-  I don't see how the kids will succeed with this little help.</div>   -->
   <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong> you'll make the list of points for a letter (or other shape)    by writing a program to collect the points at which you click the mouse into a list, instead of typing point coordinates in yourself.</div>
   <div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Typing in all these coordinates is a pain.  Why can't we just draw the letters on the screen, and then click on the endpoints of the lines?</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Umm, I think we'll get in trouble if we draw on the screen.  But we could draw on <em>tracing paper</em> (so we can still see the mouse cursor) and hold the picture up to the screen.</div>
<div><span>Alphie:</span> We'll have to write a block that keeps waiting for a mouse click, and then adds the mouse coordinates to a list.  When all the points have been entered, the block should report the list of points.</div>

             <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(At the end of the movie, you'll see that Alphie and Betsy have used a click outside the stage to indicate the end of the shape.)

  <li>Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2L2-click-points.xml">this starter project</a>. It includes the following skeleton block definition:
  <br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/list-points-starter.png" alt="starter for LIST OF POINTS"><br />
  Also in the project are helper blocks <code>go to point</code>, <code>draw from point to point</code>, <code>wait for click</code>, and <code>click on stage?</code>.  Note also that the sprite has a small circle as its costume.</li>
  <li>Finish writing <code>list of points</code> so that it collects points from mouse clicks as in the movie above and reports the list.  You'd use it this way:
  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/e-from-points.png" alt="set (E) to (list of points)">
  <br />
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Bear in mind that the purpose of this activity is for you to learn how to write code that collects points into a list.  You're going to use that knowledge on the next page.  So don't get hung up on the visual parts, which we've mostly provided for you.</li>
    <li>Start by <em>reading</em> the starter code and try to understand its structure.  For example:
    <ul><li>It uses a <code>forever</code> block.  When, and how, does it report a value?</li>
    <li>What is the <code>if else</code> block testing, and why?</li>
    <li>Where you see <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/stuff-here.png" alt="you write stuff in here">, you're going to <em>replace</em> that block with other blocks as needed to implement the algorithm.</li>
    <li>Can you use a script variable for the list inside <code>list of points</code>, or does it have to be global?
      </li></ul></li>
    <li>Start with an empty list, and add a point for each mouse click.</li>
    <li>The <code>stamp</code> block is built into Snap<em>!</em>. It puts a picture of the sprite's costume on the stage at the sprite's location.</li>
    <li>Notice how convenient it is to have <code>go to</code> and <code>draw</code> blocks built to use the point abstract data type, instead of two number inputs per point. Once you've created a point from the mouse coordinates, you never have to think about coordinates again in this activity.</li>
