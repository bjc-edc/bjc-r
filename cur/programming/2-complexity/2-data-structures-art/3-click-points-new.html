        <h2>Capturing Clicks to Draw</h2>
  <!--      <div class="todo">ST-I don't think this page belongs here.  This will not help the students for the task they need to prepare for, the Mandala.  It may belong to U3 if we end up doing the "simple studio" project (my interview submission) for which this could be a prelude.  Also looking at your solution, I see some non-trivial steps, -not just the recursive "all of" predicate, but overall subtle sequencing of code-  I don't see how the kids will succeed with this little help.</div>   -->
        <div class="learn">
On the previous page, you drew a shape based on a list of points we gave you.  <strong>On this page,</strong> you will automate the process of getting coordinates by clicking on the desired points on the screen.

                <p>ST-Suggested replacement:".....Why can't we just draw a letter on the screen by clicking on the corner points that define the letter?"</p>
                <p>Again, I don't think it's realistic to click on the screen freehand. On the previous page they drew their A on graph paper first. --bh</p>

            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Typing in all these coordinates is a pain.  Why can't we just draw the letters on the screen, and then click on the endpoints of the lines?</div>
             <!--<div class="todo">
               <p>ST-This next comment by Betsy feels a bit unrealistic, no one will try to draw on a screen or use tracing paper on a screen.<br />Suggestion: Betsy: "Great idea, how could we do that?"</p>
               <p>Selim: If you look at my ugly, ragged E, it's that way because I just eyeballed the vertices instead of having an actual printed E to work from. On the previous page, they draw an A on graph paper before entering the coordinates. I think it's absolutely realistic that kids would hold that graph in front of the screen to get the vertices right! --bh</p>

              <p><span>Betsy:</span> Umm, I think we'll get in trouble if we draw on the screen.  But we could find a picture of what we want to trace and import it as a stage background.</p>

                    Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2L2-Click.xml">this starter project</a>.  Find the "Stage" button below the actual stage and click it.<br />
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/stage-button.png" alt="stage button in sprite corral"></li>
        <li>Now click the "Backgrounds" tab near the top of the window.<br />

        We have provided two backgrounds:<ul>
        <li>A data graph (source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis) of median household income by year.</li>
        <li>A capital "E" (font: Century Gothic Bold).</li></ul>
        The first is typical of data processing, which is one topic of Unit 3.  The second continues the activity from the previous page.  Choose either one.</li>
        <li>Now go back to the Scripts tab, and choose the "Sprite" button under the stage to get back to the sprite's scripts.</li></ol></div>

<!--              <p> We'll have to write a block that keeps waiting for a mouse click, and then adds those mouse coordinates to a list.  When all the points have been entered, the block should report the list of points.<br />

              <div>  <p><span>Betsy:</span> I can think of three things our program has to do:</p></div>
              <ol><li>Initialize the <code>point list</code> variable to an empty list.</li>
                <li>Have the sprite follow the mouse.</li>
                <li>Every time the mouse is clicked, add its position to the point list, and give the user some visible feedback that the click has been processed.</li></ol></p>
             <div>   <p><span>Alphie:</span> We did the second of those in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/5-follow-the-leader/1-following-sprites.html">Unit 1</a>.</p>
                <p><span>Betsy:</span> Yes, and we did the other two in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/4-learning-names.html">that "greet player" project</a>, also in Unit 1.
                </p>
                <p><span>Alphie:</span> ... except for the part about "visual feedback."  What did you mean by that?</p>
                <p><span>Betsy:</span> Well, the user is going to be following the outline of a shape, and clicking at turning points.  That may take a while, and users get nervous if the computer doesn't seem to be paying attention.  So I thought we should draw something at each of the points where the user clicks, a little circle or something.</p>
                <p><span>Alphie:</span> I have an idea!  There's a <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/stamp.png" alt="stamp block (in Pen)"> block that paints a picture of the sprite itself on the stage.  That arrowhead thingy will point right at the point where the user clicked.</p>
          </div>
            <div class="stagedir">
                Alphie and Betsy develop code to implement their idea.<br />

            <ol start=4>
                <li>In the project file you loaded, the sprite has three scripts, one for each task in Betsy's list.  Each of these scripts is incomplete.
                <ul><li>In the first script, variable <var>point list</var> should be given an appropriate initial value.</li>
                <li>In the second script, you need a way to tell the sprite to stop following the mouse.  Replace the <code>forever</code> block with one that will stop looping when the user presses the space key.</li>
                <li>In the third script, the <code>stamp</code> block is already in place, but you have to write the code that will add the mouse's position to the list of points.  Respect the data abstraction for points.</li></ul></li>

<div class="takeItFurther">
<ol type="A">
<li>This is a good quick-and-dirty solution to the problem of entering a bunch of points into a list interactively.  But it has a couple of weaknesses:
<ul><li>Even after you tell the sprite to stop following the mouse, the "when I am clicked" script is still ready to run, and so every mouse click thereafter will add points to the list that the user didn't want.</li>
<li>The list of points is always kept in the same global variable.  So it's messy to create lists for several different letters.</li></ul>
