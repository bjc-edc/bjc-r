        <h2>Capturing Clicks as Points</h2>
  <!--      <div class="todo">ST-I don't think this page belongs here.  This will not help the students for the task they need to prepare for, the Mandala.  It may belong to U3 if we end up doing the "simple studio" project (my interview submission) for which this could be a prelude.  Also looking at your solution, I see some non-trivial steps, -not just the recursive "all of" predicate, but overall subtle sequencing of code-  I don't see how the kids will succeed with this little help.</div>   -->

        	On the previous page, you drew a shape based on a list of points you were given.  <strong>On this page,</strong> you will automate the process of getting coordinates by clicking on the desired points on the screen.

        <div class="todo">
          <p>I edited this introductory dialog because I couldn't imagine students seriously suggesting that it would be a good idea to draw on the computer screen at school, and even if I could, I don't think we should model that kind of discourse. I also wanted more to motivate the FTYD. --MF, 5/26/17</p>
          <p><strong>I strongly, strongly, vehemently protest this change, both because it's ridiculous and because <em>it was already discussed and rejected</em> and Mary is sabotaging the review process by sneaking in an already-rejected change once again at the last second. This is unacceptable behavior. If this sabotage is accepted then either from now on I insist on officially reviewing every single review by Mary or else I quit the project.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>No, Mary, <em>of course</em> Alphie is not &quot;seriously suggesting&quot; writing on the screen! He's talking the way kids actually talk, expressing legitimate frustration with the process on 2.2.1-2.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>And, I'm really sorry for the horrible obscenity of &quot;a pain&quot; rather than &quot;takes time&quot; but, sorry, this is the 21st century, and if you can find me a single high school student anywhere who says &quot;takes time&quot; when &quot;a pain&quot; is called for, I'll eat my hat.</strong></p>
          <p>I <em>think</em> that it's not just because I'm angry that I find 
        <em>nothing</em> in Mary's edits that really adds to the page. There's one edit below, in which she intersperses a dialog with a FYTD, that isn't terrible; I can take or leave it. Everything else is harmful to the page.

            <p>Selim: If you look at my ugly, ragged E, it's that way because I just eyeballed the vertices instead of having an actual printed E to work from. On the previous page, they draw an A on graph paper before entering the coordinates. I think it's absolutely realistic that kids would hold that graph in front of the screen to get the vertices right! --bh</p>

          <p>This change at least has the virtue of not having already been rejected, but I don't see the point. Instead of just saying &quot;just export all the blocks&quot; it goes through a lengthy discussion of which blocks are and aren't required (namely, all of them are, basically) and a huge digression about Obsolete blocks and dependencies, all of which just distracts from the point of the page.  Mary's version below also omits the explanation of why we provide two backgrounds, which is important! My version is in a comment following Mary's version.--bh</p>
