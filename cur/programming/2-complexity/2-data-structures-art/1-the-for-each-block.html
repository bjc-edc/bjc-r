            <h3>Ruthless Suggestions from Al</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The [lab] title: “Using Variables and Data Structures to Make Art”—Data Structures are all over this, but I see no use of “variable.” Radical suggestion: Maybe this won’t work, but can we save “variable” for things that get assigned and use “input” for things that get passed in when a command or reporter is called?</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>The title has already been changed, but I kept the comment because of the question. Thoughts, Brian? --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>
                <li>Radical suggestion: Do we need to declare data types? It’s just one more thing for the user to track.</li>
                <ul><li>No, but we do it in our blocks, so we thought we should show how it's done. I think it should be in a yellow box. Brian, why did you opt for green? --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>
                <li># 1: What does it mean: “Load and build their go to point block.” And when I load it, I see a list.</li>
                <ul><li>I think this just needs some clarification. --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>

        <div class="todo">
            <p>This page is long. I suggest we consider breaking page between 2 and TOL and again between TIF and 7--making this into 3 separate pages. --MF, 9/26/18</p>
            <p>This project has <code>for each</code> already imported. The page should be clear that students will have to import tools if they want to use <code>for each</code> in their own projects. --MF, 11/15/17</p>
            <p>Brian says that the goto block has changed and so we no longer need selectors. Need to discuss the implications of this with at least Paul. --MF, 12/19/18</p>

            <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will create tools for drawing complex designs from lists of points. To do this, you will use problem decomposition&mdash;breaking down the problem into smaller pieces. </p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will create a script that lets you connect the dots (given by a list of points) to draw the letter A. </p>

            <div class="stagedir">
                <p>Alphie and Betsy are building a program that will take a list of points (each of which is a list of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates) as input and connect the dots. They figure they can use it to draw pictures or graphs of data:</p>
                <p> 
      To make a set of starting data, they sketched the letter A on graph paper. They chose a <em>scale</em> that they figured would make their picture a good size on the stage.<br />
                    <div class="todo">
                    ST-Many NYC teachers were confused and thought they are creating the list A themselves whereas we give it to them in the starter file.
                    </div>
                   
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/AonGraphPaper2.PNG"  height="300" alt="Letter A drawn of graph paper with corner coordinates" title="Letter A drawn of graph paper with corner coordinates"/><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/AonGraphPaper3.PNG"  height="300" alt="Corner coordinates (-50, 20) (-10,120), ... (-30,20)" title="Corner coordinates (-50, 20) (-10,120), ... (-30,20)"/>
                   <br /> 
  Then they  listed  the coordinates of each vertex, starting at the arrow and going clockwise around the figure. The first point is at (-50, 20), the second is (-10, 120), and so on. Then they built that list in Snap<em>!</em> like this:<br /> 
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinate-list-for-A.png" alt="coordinate-list-for-A" title="coordinate-list-for-A"><br /> 
                    Now they need a script that will use that list to make the drawing, like this:<br />
                    <img border="2" class="center" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/drawA.gif" alt="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" title="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" />
                </p>
            </div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> This list  of coordinates outlines an A, so let's name it A.</div>
            <div class="stagedir">
                <div class="comment">I don't think we should use <code>code</code> tags for Make a variable. Should we? --MF, 12/19/18 </div>
                <p>Betsy clicks <code>Make a variable</code>, names it <code>A</code>,  and builds <img  src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/A.png" alt="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" title="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" />. </p>
                <p>Then she clicks that <code>set</code> block to run it.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <span>Alphie:</span> So, for each of those eight points, we want the sprite to move to it. Hmmm... <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/go-to-x()-y().png" height="41" alt="go to x:() y:()" title="go to x:() y:()" />  won't  work, because it needs two separate inputs. We need a block that  takes <em>one</em> input, a point like <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/list(-50)(20).png" height="37" alt="list(-50)(20)" title="list(-50)(20)" />.

			</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> So we'll make a <em>new </em>block. Let's call it <code>go to point</code>. It'll work like this <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/go-to-point(list(-50)(20)).png" alt="go to point (list (-50) (20))" title="go to point (list (-50) (20))" />. We'll use  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/go-to-x()-y().png" height="41" alt="go to x:() y:()" title="go to x:() y:()" /> or <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/glide(.5)secs-to-x()-y().png" height="41" alt="glide (.5) secs to x:() y:()" title="glide (.5) secs to x:() y:()" /> <em>inside</em> it, but we'll have to process the input, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/list(-50)(20).png" height="37" alt="list(-50)(20)" title="list(-50)(20)" />, to supply <code>x:</code> and <code>y:</code> separately. Hmmm... </div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span>  Oh! I know how! I bet we can use <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/item()of(list).png" height="35" alt="item()of(list)" title="item()of(list)">. Give it a number as its first input. I bet that the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/list_input_slot.png" alt="rectangle with two smaller orange rectangles inside" title="rectangle with two smaller orange rectangles inside" /> just says that it expects a list as its second input.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> I wonder if we can make <em>our</em> <code>go to point</code> block show that it expects a list as input....</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Yes, <em>you</em> can make <em>your</em> blocks show what type of data they expect as inputs: a number, a list, or some other type. Some languages <em>require</em> the data type to be indicated. In Snap<em>!</em> it's an option. It's not necessary but, like assigning a color to a block, it can be a helpful reminder of what the block does and what type of input it expects. You've already seen input slots of several shapes, indicating different expected data types. </p>
