        <div class="todo">
            <p><strong>What students do:</strong> They build a script that takes a list of points as input and connects the dots. Useful for drawing and, later, for plotting data points. <br />
            <strong>What students learn:</strong> They think about problem decomposition in the form of tool-building, and creating and debugging an algorithm. First they build a block that goes to <em>one</em> point, using <code>item of</code> to decompose a pair of coordinates into the x and y components. Then they build a script that uses <code>for each</code> to go to all points, then a block that is defined by that script. In each case, they focus on the nature and use of the input.</p>
            <p><strong>Follow-up:</strong> I think that after this, students should <em>use</em> the thinking that they've done in problem 5. They should have the experience of clicking on some data points on an imported line graph (perhaps from a news article), reading the coordinates, making a list of them, and having Snap plot that line graph.</p>

               	  <p>Alphie and Betsy want to build a program that will take a list of coordinates as input and connect the dots. They figure this will be useful both for drawing pictures, and for drawing graphs of data. To make a set of starting data, they sketch the letter A on graph paper. </p>
               	  <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/sketch-of-letter-A.png" height="200" alt="sketch-of-letter-A"></p>
               	  <p><br /> 
               	   Then they make a list of the coordinates for each vertex.<br /> The first coordinate (bottom left) is (-50, 20), the second is (-10, 120), and so on. <br /> 
               	    <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinate-list-for-A.png" alt="coordinate-list-for-A"><br /> 
               	    Now they need  a script that will use that list and make the drawing, like this:<br />
               	    <img border="2" class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/drawA.gif" alt="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" title="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" /> <br />
           	      </p>

            <div><span>Betsy:</span> This list  of coordinates outlines an A, so let's name it A.</div>
				<div class="stagedir">
				  <p>Betsy clicks <code>Make a variable</code>, names it <code>A</code>,  and builds <img  src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/A.png" alt="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" title="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" />. </p>
				  <p>Then she clicks <code>set</code>.</p>

            <div>
            	<span>Alphie:</span> So, for each of those eight points, we want  the sprite to go to it. I guess the first thing to do is build a  <code>go to point</code> block that will take <em>one</em> point like <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/list(-50)(20).png" height="37" alt="list(-50)(20)">
as input like this        	    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/go-to-point(list(-50)(20)).png" height="46" alt="go-to-point(list(-50)(20))">, and will go to that point.
<div class="stagedir">Alphie  knows that either <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/go-to-x()-y().png" height="41" alt="go-to-x()-y()"> or <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/glide(.5)secs-to-x()-y().png" height="41" alt="glide(.5)secs-to-x()-y()"> will be the perfect thing inside <code>go to point</code>.</div>
            	But how do we get the right coordinates in the blanks after <code>x:</code> and <code>y:</code>?
                <!-- <img  src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/A_foreach.png" alt="script with for each (item) of (A) {glide 1 secs to x:(blank) y:(blank)} then glide to (0, 0)" title="script with for each (item) of (A) {glide 1 secs to x:(blank) y:(blank)} then glide to (0, 0)" /> -->
            </div>
                
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Hmm... Oh! I bet we can use <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/item()of(list).png" height="35" alt="item()of(list)">.</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> It looks like <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/item()of(list).png" height="35" alt="item()of(list)"> is expecting a number as its first input, and I bet that the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/list_input_slot.png" alt="rectangle with two smaller orange rectangles inside" title="rectangle with two smaller orange rectangles inside" /> is a way of telling us that it expects a list as its second input.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> I wonder if we can make our <code>go to point</code> block  show that it expects a list as input....</div>
        </div>
        

Yes, it is possible for <em>you</em> to define your blocks in a way that indicates what type of data they expect as inputs: a number, a list or some other type. Some languages <em>require</em> the data type to be indicated. In Snap<em>!</em> it's an option. It is not necessary but, like assigning a color to a block, it can be a helpful reminder of what the block does and what type of input it expects. You have already seen input slots of several shapes, indicating different expected data types.

        <div class="sidenote">Notice in the video that there are many input types you can specify (Text, Number, Boolean, etc.)  The <strong>list</strong> input type is chosen because a <code>point</code> is a <em>list</em> of two coordinates.<br />
