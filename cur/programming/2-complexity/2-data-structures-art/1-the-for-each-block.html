        <div class="todo">
            <p><strong>What students do:</strong> They build a script that takes a list of points as input and connects the dots. Useful for drawing and, later, for plotting data points. <br />
            <strong>What students learn:</strong> They think about problem decomposition in the form of tool-building, and creating and debugging an algorithm. First they build a block that goes to <em>one</em> point, using <code>item of</code> to decompose a pair of coordinates into the x and y components. Then they build a script that uses <code>for each</code> to go to all points, then a block that is defined by that script. In each case, they focus on the nature and use of the input.</p>
			<p><strong>Follow-up:</strong> I think that after this, students should <em>use</em> the thinking that they've done in problem 5. They should have the experience of clicking on some data points on an imported line graph (perhaps from a news article), reading the coordinates, making a list of them, and having Snap plot that line graph.<ul><li>Do we have this in U2 or are we planning it for another unit? --MF</li></ul></p>

            [Changed from comment to todo because I'm having trouble seeing the pink box with all the comments! --bh]
This is the first page of a lab, and so its pink box refers to the entire lab. 
    The purpose of the image is not to duplicate an image they'll see two inches 
    down the page, but to motivate the relatively simple beginning of the lab by 
    appealing to its more complex conclusion, just like the pictures of modern art 
    in the first pink box of that U1 lab.  --bh<br />PAUL?		</div>

			<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will create tools for drawing complex designs from lists of points. To do this, you will use problem decomposition&mdash;breaking down the problem into smaller pieces. </p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will create a script that lets you connect the dots (given by a list of points) to draw the letter A. </p>
			<div class="todo"><em>A</em> (singular) list of coordinates? Doesn't it take two lists to make A? --MF<br />
            The picture makes it clear what we're drawing. And it leaves room for the TIF 
    in which they work out a notation for indicating in the list of points that the 
    pen should be raised between a given pair of points. --bh<br /><hr> 
    <p>(BTW for the future, I wonder why are we still doing A and not T, H, E, I, K, L, M, etc. which don't require multiple lists. Or why not let students have a choice from a list of one-list letters?) --MF, 5/17/17<br />
      That would be a spurious choice, like a parent responding to "I don't want to 
      go to bed!" with "Would you like your red pajamas or your blue pajamas?" Alphie 
      and Betty are drawing a specific letter and getting a specific list as a 
      result. We can't make that connection if kids are asked to make a (trivial) 
      choice among letters. Having students <em>draw and collect points from</em> other 
      letters <em>afterward</em> would make a fine ITIT.</p>
    <p>I would be okay, though, with picking a different letter and then having the TIF be &quot;extend this project so it can deal with non-single-path letters such as A.&quot;--bh<br />

				<p>Alphie and Betsy are building a program that will take a list of points (each of which is a list of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates) as input and connect the dots. They figure they can use it to draw pictures or graphs of data:</p>
				<p> 
				    To make a set of starting data, they sketch the letter A on graph paper.<br />
				    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/sketch-of-letter-A.png" height="200" alt="sketch-of-letter-A"><br /> 
				    Then they make a list of the coordinates for each vertex. The first coordinate pair is (-50, 20), the second is (-10, 120), and so on. <br /> 
				    <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinate-list-for-A.png" alt="coordinate-list-for-A"><br /> 
				    Now they need  a script that will use that list to make the drawing, like this:<br />

            	<span>Alphie:</span> So, for each of those eight points, we want the sprite to go to it. I guess the first thing to do is build a  <code>go to point</code> block that will take <em>one</em> point like <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/list(-50)(20).png" height="37" alt="list(-50)(20)">
as input like this <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/go-to-point(list(-50)(20)).png"  alt="go-to-point(list(-50)(20))">, and will go to that point.

            	But how do we get the right coordinates in the blanks after <code>x:</code> and <code>y:</code>?

            <div><span>Alphie:</span> I wonder if we can make our <code>go to point</code> block  show that it expects a list as input....</div>

Yes, it is possible for <em>you</em> to define your blocks in a way that indicates what type of data they expect as inputs: a number, a list, or some other type. Some languages <em>require</em> the data type to be indicated. In Snap<em>!</em> it's an option. It is not necessary but, like assigning a color to a block, it can be a helpful reminder of what the block does and what type of input it expects. You have already seen input slots of several shapes, indicating different expected data types.

          <p><em>I</em> wouldn't. &quot;Go to each point&quot; strikes me as too special-purpose to be worth exporting a two-line script. (There comes a point where finding something in your immense collection of exported blocks is harder than just writing it again!) &quot;Go to point&quot; is worth exporting as part of a whole point library that would also include &quot;position&quot; (reports a point), &quot;mouse position,&quot; &quot;glide to point,&quot; &quot;point towards point,&quot; and &quot;distance to point.&quot; </p>
          <p>Anyway, there has been a lot of activity recently around the idea of exporting and importing blocks, and it's getting to be the tail wagging the dog.
