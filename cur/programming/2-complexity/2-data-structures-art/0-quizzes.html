            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>data type</strong> is  what type of data something is (number, text string, list, etc.). For example, Betsy noticed that the <em>data type</em> for the second input to <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/item.png" height="35" alt="item (1) of ()" title="item (1) of ()"> is a list. </li>
                <li>
                    Each programming language provides some <strong>primitive data types</strong> (data types that are built-in). For example, Snap<em>!</em> provides numbers, text (words and sentences), Booleans, lists, and some you haven't yet used as data. This block's pull-down menu shows all of Snap<em>!</em>'s primitive types:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/isa-menu.png" alt="primitive types: number, text, Boolean, list, sprite, command, reporter, predicate" title="primitive types: number, text, Boolean, list, sprite, command, reporter, predicate"/>
                </li>
                <li>An <strong>abstract data type</strong> (or <strong>ADT</strong>) is a custom data type that's meaningful to your program. It's not built into the language; you develop it as you code. For example Gamal, Betsy, and Alphie just made up a <code>question answer</code> abstract data type.</li>

            <div class="endnote">
                <p>The word "abstract" is often used casually to mean something <em>harder</em> to understand or more complex, but in computer science, its meaning is almost the opposite. ADTs are things that you, the programmer, create to make your program <em>easier</em> for you and others to read, debug, and improve.</p>

                    Users might answer questions that are close enough but not exactly the answer you expected. For example, someone might answer "What kind of variable is available only in the part of the program where it is defined?" with "a local variable," "local variable," or just "local" and the same possibilities for "script variable." So your <code>question answer</code> ADT could take a <em>list</em> of keywords in the second slot and accept any answer that includes any of the keywords (so in this case, the list would be {local, script} and would accept "a local one"). Use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/contains-empty.png" alt="() contains ()" title="() contains ()" /> to adapt your code.
