        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will begin to develop a quiz app by creating an <em>abstract data type</em> to pair the questions with their answers.</p>

                <p>A <strong>sublist</strong> is a list used as an item of another list.</p>
				<p>(The word sublist is also used to refer to some subset of a list.)</p>
            </div>
            You'll use a list to store your quiz items in a global variable and use a <em>sublist</em> for each question/answer pair. Then you can choose just one pair at a time to work with.

A better way is to <em>use abstraction</em> to organize the quiz items. The abstraction just hides the <code>list</code> and <code>item of</code> blocks, so it isn't complicated to build, but it can make your code much easier to write, read, and debug.<br />

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A <strong>data type</strong> is what kind of data something is (number, text string, list, etc.). For example, <em>number</em> is the data type for the first input to <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/item.png" height="35" alt="item (1) of ()" title="item (1) of ()"> and <em>list</em> is the the data type for its second input.

                <li>
                    Each programming language provides some <strong>primitive data types</strong> (data types that are built-in). For example, Snap<em>!</em> provides numbers, text (words and sentences), Booleans (true or false), lists, and some you haven't yet used as data (such as sprites and costumes). <a href="#hint-primitive" data-toggle="collapse" title="This menu shows all of Snap!'s primitive types.">This menu shows all of Snap<em>!</em>'s primitive types.</a>

                    <p>The word "abstract" is often used casually to mean something <em>harder</em> to understand or more complex, but in computer science, its meaning is almost the opposite. ADTs are things that you, the programmer, create to make your program <em>easier</em> for you and others to read, debug, and improve.</p>

                <li>
                    An <strong>abstract data type (ADT)</strong> is a custom data type that's meaningful to your program. It's not built into the language; you develop it as you code. This is an abstraction because it hides the details inside the constructor and selectors so that the programmer who uses a <code>quiz item</code> has to think only about questions and answers, not about list indices.

				<p>Reshma Saujani (born 1975) founded the nonprofit organization Girls Who Code in response to the historical decline in the number of women employed in computer science fields. According to their website, in 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women. As of 2023, it’s only 24%. Reshma and Girls Who Code aim to fix this imbalance by running clubs that teach girls CS. In addition to being an activist, Reshma was the first Indian American woman to run for Congress and has served as New York City’s Deputy Public Advocate, where she created innovative partnerships to support DREAMers and promote campaign finance reform, among other initiatives.</p>
