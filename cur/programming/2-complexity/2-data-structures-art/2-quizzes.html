            You'll use a list to store your quiz items in a variable.

            That might be ok for the first quiz item (you could use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/item-1-of-csquiz.png" alt="item (1) of (computer science quiz)" title="item (1) of (computer science quiz)"> to get the first question and <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/item-2-of-csquiz.png" alt="item (2) of (computer science quiz)" title="item (2) of (computer science quiz)"> to get the first answer), but for a long quiz, you might leave out one answer by accident and then after that, the program will get questions and answers mixed up.

            This abstraction just hides the <code>list</code> and <code>item of</code> blocks, so it isn't complicated to build, but it can make your code <em>much</em> easier to write, read, and debug.<br />

                    The constructor and selector together make up the <code>quiz item</code> <em>abstract data type</em>. An <strong>abstract data type</strong> (or <strong>ADT</strong>) is a custom data type that's meaningful to your program. It's not built into the language; you develop it as you code. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    A <strong>data type</strong> is what kind of data something is (number, text string, list, etc.). For example, the data type for the first input to <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/item.png" height="35" alt="item (1) of ()" title="item (1) of ()"> is number and the data type for its second input is list.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each programming language provides some <strong>primitive data types</strong> (data types that are built-in). For example, Snap<em>!</em> provides numbers, text (words and sentences), Booleans (true or false), lists, and some you haven't yet used as data (such as sprites and costumes). <a href="#hint-target" data-toggle="collapse" title="This block's pull-down menu shows all of Snap!'s primitive types.">This block's pull-down menu shows all of Snap<em>!</em>'s primitive types.</a>

                <p>The word "abstract" is often used casually to mean something <em>harder</em> to understand or more complex, but in computer science, its meaning is almost the opposite.
