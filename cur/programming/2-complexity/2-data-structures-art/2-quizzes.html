                    The constructor and selector together implement the <code>quiz item</code> <em>abstract data type</em>. An <strong>abstract data type</strong> (or <strong>ADT</strong>) is a custom data type that's meaningful to your program. It's not built into the language; you develop it as you code. This is an abstraction because it hides the details inside the constructor and selectors so that the programmer who uses a <code>quiz item</code> only has think about questions and answers and not about list indices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A <strong>data type</strong> is what kind of data something is (number, text string, list, etc.). For example, <em>number</em> is the data type for the first input to <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/item.png" height="35" alt="item (1) of ()" title="item (1) of ()"> and <em>list</em> is the the data type for its second input.

                    Each programming language provides some <strong>primitive data types</strong> (data types that are built-in).
