            When you used <code>item of</code> with lists in Unit 1, you were accessing items from the list randomly, but you can also select a specific item in a list by specifying its <em>position</em> by  number. That number is called the <strong>index</strong>.<br />

            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>data type</strong> is  what type of data something is (number, text string, list, etc.). For example, Betsy noticed that the <em>data type</em> for the second input to <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/item.png" height="35" alt="item (1) of ()" title="item (1) of ()"> is a list. </li>
                <li>
                    Each programming language provides some <strong>primitive data types</strong> (data types that are built-in). For example, Snap<em>!</em> provides numbers, text (words and sentences), Booleans, lists, and some you haven't yet used as data. This block's pull-down menu shows all of Snap<em>!</em>'s primitive types:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/isa-menu.png" alt="primitive types: number, text, Boolean, list, sprite, command, reporter, predicate" title="primitive types: number, text, Boolean, list, sprite, command, reporter, predicate"/>
                </li>
                <li>An <strong>abstract data type</strong> (or <strong>ADT</strong>) is a custom data type that's meaningful to your program. It's not built into the language; you develop it as you code. For example Gamal, Betsy, and Alphie just made up a <code>question answer</code> abstract data type.</li>
                <li><strong>Data abstraction</strong> is the creation and use of abstract data types in a program.</li>

            <div class="endnote">
                <p>The word "abstract" is often used casually to mean something <em>harder</em> to understand or more complex, but in computer science, its meaning is almost the opposite. ADTs are things that you, the programmer, create to make your program <em>easier</em> for you and others to read, debug, and improve.</p>
