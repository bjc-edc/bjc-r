            But code like <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/item-1-of-item-3-of.png" alt="item (1) of (item (3) of (computer science quiz))" title="item (1) of (item (3) of (computer science quiz))" /> is hard to read and understand. A better way is to <em>use abstraction</em> to organize the quiz items. The abstraction just hides the <code>list</code> and <code>item of</code> blocks, so it isn't complicated to build, but it can make your code much easier to write, read, and debug.<br />

                    A <strong>data type</strong> is what kind of data something is (number, text string, list, etc.). For example, <em>number</em> is the data type for the first input to <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/item.png" height="35" alt="item (1) of ()" title="item (1) of ()"> and <em>list</em> is the the data type for its second input.

                    Each programming language provides some <strong>primitive data types</strong> (data types that are built-in).

                    <p>The word "abstract" is often used casually to mean something <em>harder</em> to understand or more complex, but in computer science, its meaning is almost the opposite. ADTs are things that you, the programmer, create to make your program <em>easier</em> for you and others to read, debug, and improve.</p>

                <li>
                    An <strong>abstract data type (ADT)</strong> is a custom data type that's meaningful to your program. It's not built into the language; you develop it as you code. This is an abstraction because it hides the details inside the constructor and selectors so that the programmer who uses a <code>quiz item</code> has to think only about questions and answers, not about list indices.

By naming the pieces of the structure, the constructor makes it certain that every time you use it, you build the structure in the right order.<br />

                    <p>Your selectors expect a quiz item, i.e., a list, as input.  You can make your blocks <em>show</em> what type of data they expect. It's not necessary in Snap<em>!</em> but, like assigning a color to a block, it can be a helpful reminder of what the block does and what type of input it expects. You've already seen input slots of several shapes, indicating different expected data types. </p>

                        In the Block Editor while creating a selector, click on a plus sign to enter an input name.  Then...
