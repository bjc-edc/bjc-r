		<h3>Functional Programming</h3>

		<p>In the language used on the exam, the only way to generate list data is with <em>commands,</em> actions that <em>change</em> the contents of a list: <code>Add</code>. <code>Insert</code>. <code>Replace</code>. <code>Delete</code>.  They take this approach because they think it's the easiest programming style for you to understand, and also to include Scratch, in which these commands are the only mechanism provided for working with lists.  But there's a better way, called <strong>functional programming</strong>, in which you never modify a data structure, but instead make a new one to hold the new values.</p>

        <div class="todo">I've yet to be convinced that it's <em>always</em> better. Certainly, in some cases it is, but sometimes, it's a big ugly confusing mess. Remember when you tried to prove that <code>draw square</code> could be done functionally? (Also, I'll need to tweak this language a bit for "they" and "easiest", and the reference to Scratch is unclear because many users won't know what that is.) --MF, 5/30/20</div>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="10">
				<div class="todo">We don't use the brackets for student-facing content very often if at all, and it's not the way the College Board notates lists. I'm pretty sure they use square brackets. --MF, 5/30/20</div>
                <li>You have a shopping list, and you want to have the plurals of all the foods.  (You're going to buy some apples, not one apple.)  The initial value of <var>shopping list</var> is <code>{apple, banana}</code>.  Consider these five scripts:
				<div class="todo">This is an unreasonable amount of code to parse and that distracts from the goal of the page. Better to just show one NFP and one FP and talk them through what you want them to notice (or give them meaningful questions to help them conclude what you want). --MF, 5/30/20</div>
                <ol type="A">
					<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plurals-1.png"></li>
					<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plurals-2.png"></li>
					<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plurals-3.png"></li>
					<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plurals-4a.png"><br />
					    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plurals-4b.png"></li>
					<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plurals-5.png"></li>
				</ol>
				You haven't met <code>map</code> yet.  It's a higher-order function that creates a new list, the same length as its input list, in which each item is computed by applying its input function to the corresponding item of the input list.
                    <div class="todo">We can't use <code>map</code> to each FP before they know what map is.</div>
			</li><li>
				<ol type="a">
				<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png">
					<li>After each of these scripts, what is the value of <var>plural shopping list</var>?</li>
					<li>After each of these scripts, what is the value of <var>shopping list</var>?</li>
				</ol>
                <div class="todo">OK, this is the start of what I mean by "meaningful questions to help them conclude what you want." Need to also ask something like "Would you want the value of shopping list to change and be the same as plurals of...?" or something like that. --MF, 5/30/20</div>
			</li>
            </ol>
		</div>
		<p>The point of that exercise is that for the first three scripts, the <em>imperative programming</em> ones, it takes careful attention to be sure what the final value of <var>shopping list</var> is.  (In one case it's the same as before; in one case it's the same as <var>plural shopping list</var>; in one case the answer depends on whether you're programming in Snap<i>!</i> or in AP-language.  (See the gray box just before the "Functional Programming" header.)</p>
        <div class="todo">"imperative"? This world comes out of no where. If we are going to use it, it will need explanation such as in a vocab box. --MF, 5/30/20<p>I don't understand the end of that paragraph. Is it referring to something that doesn't exist?Also, if we want to walk through why it's different in Snap<em>!</em> than in APtran (which I don't think we should), then that text could work, but otherwise, it's confusing. --MF, 5/30/20</p></div>
		<p>By contrast, in the last two scripts it should be easy to see that no change is made to <var>shopping list</var>.  That's because these last two scripts use functional programming style:  You create a new list without any <code>replace</code> or <code>add</code> instructions.</p>
        <div class="todo">Don't say "easy" even on an easy page--which this is not. --MF, 5/30/20</div>
		<p>You have to recognize the imperative programming style for the exam.  (You will not be asked to <em>write</em> code on the exam.)  But you should also be comfortable with the functional style.  in particular, we hope you'll enjoy the elegance of the fifth script, a one-liner that creates the list of plurals without changing the original list.</p>
        <div class="todo">I'm going to stop picking this page apart. I have a lot of qualms. Mostly, it's too much and too little at the same time. I feel like it's confusingly complicated and hand-wavy and yet misses the core things we want kids to get. I believe we need a page (or at least content) like this, but we aren't there yet with this, and I'm not sure what to do at this late hour or where it belongs... --MF, 5/30/20</div>
		<div class="takeNote">At one time, functional programming was viewed by "real" programmers as something of interest only to computer science professors.  But today it's a favored way to program because of parallel-processing hardware, either with  racks full of computers or with multicore processor chips that include four or eight processors inside a single chip.  The reason is that with multiple processes running in parallel, it's possible for two of them to be trying to modify the same variable at the same time, with bad results.  But if the program is written functionally, nothing is ever modified, so that can't happen.  There are <em>functional languages</em> in which there are no equivalents to <code>set</code> or <code>replace</code>.<div class="todo">Why is this a takenote? Is that a mistake?  It actually seems like something that should be an endnote (and not just because it should be set apart in a box). --MF, 5/30/20</div>
		</div>

        <div class="todo">When we talk, can you tell me what the solution is to this TIF? Does it have to be done functionally, or is having it here a hint that it's best to? --MF, 5/30/20</div>
        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <div class="sidenoteBig">There is a Search button sprite already in your file. You can use  <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/show.png" alt="show" title="show" /> to see it. </div>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Write a script for the "Search" button that tells the user whether an item is already on the list.  You can use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/contains-empty.png" alt="'list input slot' contains ()" title="'list input slot' contains ()" /> to see if an item is already on the list.</li>
            </ol>
            <p style="clear: both; height: 0px;"></p>
        </div>
        <div class="todo">Here's what I leave wanting to know: what are the core ideas that you want to teach with a page like this?that FP doesn't mutate? anything else? Do we really need to make a distinction between imperative and functional or could we just point out that kids be mindful about whether they want their code to be changing the original list, show them how to not change the original list, and then say BTW that's FP? Also, I think I recall that you put this with shopping list because that was actually our context best suited to discussing FP; is that true? And we might as well discuss that the actual <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-contact-list/5-mapping-over-list.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">MAP page in U3</a> is something Paul and I don't like and want to fix--so maybe that ties in somehow. Maybe this could be folded into that as a way to strengthen that page... --MF, 5/30/20</div>
