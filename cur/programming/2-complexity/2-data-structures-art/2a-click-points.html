        <h2>Click to Draw</h2>
        
<div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Typing in all these coordinates is a pain.  Why can't we just draw the letters on the screen, and then click on the endpoints of the lines?</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Umm, I think we'll get in trouble if we draw on the screen.  But we could draw on <em>tracing paper</em> (so we can still see the mouse cursor) and hold the picture up to the screen.</div>
<div><span>Alphie:</span> We'll have to write a block that keeps waiting for a mouse click, and then adds the mouse coordinates to a list.  When all the points have been entered, the block should report the list of points.</div>
             <p><img class="imageLeft" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/E.gif" width="183" height="318" alt="Entering points for E"></p>              <p>&nbsp;</p>
             <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(In this version of the program, Alphie and Betsy have used a click outside the stage to indicate the end of the shape.  You can signal the end in a different way if you prefer.)

<div type="first" class="forYouToDo">
<ol><li>Write a reporter <code>list of points</code> that collects points from mouse clicks as in the movie and reports the list.  You'd use it this way:
<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/e-from-points.png" alt="set (E) to (list of points)">
<br />
<ol type="a">
<li>Make a small circle costume that the sprite can <code>stamp</code> to indicate the recorded points visually.</li>
<li>You'll need to use both

  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/wait-mouse-down.png" alt="wait until (mouse down)">
and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/wait-not-mouse-down.png" alt="wait until (not (mouse down?))">
in your algorithm.</li>
<li>Can you use a script variable for the list inside <code>list of points</code>, or does it have to be global?
</li>
<li>Start with an empty list, and add a point for each mouse click.</li>
</ol>
</li></ol></div>
