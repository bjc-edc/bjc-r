		<div class="todo">
			<p>There is lot of reading on this page. I made some cuts; can we make more? --MF, 5/17/17</p>
            <p>Why this? I'm concerened about A requiring two lists.  Do we have a solid rationale and support plan? I'm concerned that it either leaves the first effort to draw a shape unfinished or it leaves the students sorting out the 2-lists issue with little support. --MF, 5/17/17</p>

		<!--<p>A <strong>data type</strong> is a label that specifies what type of data a variable can hold. In some programming languages, there are different data types for numbers than for words&mdash;or even for different kinds of numbers (for instance, integers vs. decimals). In Snap<em>!</em>, there are variables (which each hold one piece of data that can be either a number or text) and lists (which hold multiple pieces of data&mdash;numbers or text). We can also create our own data types to help clarify our code.</p>  -->
		<div class="learn">
			<strong>On this page,</strong> you will create an abstract data type <code>point</code> to make your U2L2-DrawShape code easier to read, debug, and use:<br />

            <div class="todo">I'd rather see a <code>draw shape</code> (or <code>go to each point</code>, as I prefer) block here with this as input. If agreed, perhaps Selim could do it? --MF, 5/17/17 Why? That's not how it appears in the lesson below.--bh</div>

            Just as the name suggests, a <strong>data type</strong> is  what type of data something is (number, text string, list, etc.). Each programming language provides some <strong>primitive</strong> (built in) <strong>data types</strong>. Snap<em>!</em> provides numbers, text (words and sentences), lists, Booleans, and some you haven't yet used as data:<br />
            <div class="sidenote">This block's pull-down menu shows all of Snap<em>!</em>'s primitive types.</div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/isa-menu.png" alt="primitive types" title="primitive types"/>
        </p>
        <div class="comment">
            You can't put actual new course content in a Vocabulary box!  The rule is, students are <em>supposed to skip</em> those boxes as they do the lab, coming back to them later to study for the exam.
            <p>Brian, is this your comment? I don't think we should break up our vocab treatment into 'vocab that is not labeled vocab because we want you to read it now' and 'vocab that is labeled vocab that you don't have to read now.' That seems really weird to me. --MF, 5/22/17</p>
        </div>
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p>An <strong>abstract data type</strong> (or <strong>ADT</strong>) is a kind of data that's meaningful to your program but not built into the language. You develop it as you program. <!-- Examples might be &quot;sentence&quot; in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/1-gossip.html">Unit 1 Lab 2</a> or &quot;angle&quot; in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/1-exploring-motion.html">Unit 1 Lab 3</a>. --> </p>
            <p>For example in this lab, you'll create a <em>point</em> data type with both <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point()().png" alt="point constuctor block" title="point constuctor block"> to <em>construct</em> the ADT and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/xcoordinateof.png" height="35" alt="x coordinate of" title="x coordinate of"> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/ycoordinateof.png" height="35" alt="y coordinate of" title="y coordinate of"> to <em>select</em> either coordinate of a point. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p>The word "abstract" is often used casually as if it means something <em>harder</em> to understand or more complex, but in computer science, its meaning is almost the opposite. ADTs are things that you, the programmer, create to make your program <em>easier</em> for you and others to read, debug, and improve.</p>

        	<div class="stagedir">Gamal joins Betsy and Alphie's <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/1-the-for-each-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">ongoing discussion</a> about using a list of coordinates to draw a letter.</div>
        	<div><span>Gamal:</span> I was looking at our <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/go-to-point().png" alt="go-to-point()"> block and thought of a way to make it much easier to read.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Yeah, expressions like <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/item2ofpoint.png" height="40" alt="item(2)of-point" title="item(2)of-point" />  are hard to read. Even after I wrote it to find the <em>y</em> coordinate, I had to think twice to understand it.</div>
            <div class="sidenote">Gamal is suggesting <strong>data abstraction</strong>: creating a new ADT to hide the details. When using the <code>point</code> ADT, you won't have to think about how points are represented as lists.</div> 
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> That's what I mean. <!--The <code>item</code> <var>2</var> <code>of</code> block gives us a number—the <em>y</em>-coordinate—if  its input is a point, but gives us a <em>point</em>—a list of two numbers—if its input is a list of points.--> Let's make it clearer. We can define a <code>y coordinate</code> <!--<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/ycoordinateofpoint.png" alt="y coordinate block" title="y coordinate block">--> block to use instead of <code>item 2 of</code> <!--<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/item2ofpoint.png" alt="item(2)-of-(point)" title="item(2)-of-(point)">-->.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> But that block wouldn't do anything. It isn't going to make the program any shorter if it does the same thing as <code>item 2 of</code>.</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> Yes, but it'll make the program easier to read and <em>easier to think about</em>. We can use <code>x coordinate</code> and <code>y coordinate</code> instead of <code>item of</code> as inputs to the <code>go to</code><!-- <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y.png" alt="go to x: y:">--> block.</div>

            <div> <span>Betsy:</span> Hmmm... If we make a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point()().png" alt="point () ()" title="point () ()" /> block, then we can write <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point-list-for-A.png" height="80" alt="point-list-for-A"> instead of <img height="56" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinate-list-for-A.png"  alt="coordinate-list-for-A">.

                <p>I see no reason not to have them build the block (and I'd call it <code>go to each point</code>) on the previous page. --MF, 5/17/17</p>
                <p>Please don't say &quot;a list of data stored as the ADT <code>point</code>&quot;; the point of this terminology is to make life easier, not harder. It's &quot;a list of points.&quot; I have no opinion about whether to make the block right away, except that doing so in order to be able to export it is the tail wagging the dog. I think Paul explained in a comment on the previous page why he doesn't want to, though. Oh, also, a minor point maybe, but the script uses the constructor as well as the selectors, whereas the block will use only the selectors. So it would take some wordsmithing to say &quot;Improve both the draw shape block and the script that calls it to use...&quot;--bh</p>

That seems like a hassle and I'd expect some students to type something wrong while doing that. Can we just give them that list with the point blocks in it? Or perhaps there is an easier way to do this that I'm not seeing? --MF, 5/22/17</p>
