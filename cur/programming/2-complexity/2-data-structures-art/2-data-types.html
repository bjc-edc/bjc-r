<!--        <p>A <strong>data type</strong> is a label that specifies what type of data a variable can hold. In some programming languages, there are different data types for numbers than for words&mdash;or even for different kinds of numbers (for instance, integers vs. decimals). In Snap<em>!</em>, there are variables (which each hold one piece of data that can be either a number or text) and lists (which hold multiple pieces of data&mdash;numbers or text). We can also create our own data types to help clarify our code.</p>  -->
		<div class="learn">
			<strong>On this page</strong> you will create a new data type, <code>point</code>, to make your U2L2-DrawShape code easier to read, debug, and use.

        <div class="vocabBig">: binary sequence
        <p><em>Every</em> kind of information in the computer—whether it is a number, text, list, or an instruction to perform—is stored as a sequence of 0s and 1s (a <strong>binary sequence</strong>). So, for a program to work, the computer needs to be told how to interpret any such sequence of 0s and 1s.</p>
      </div>
      <div class=sidenoteBig>
		<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/isa-menu.png" alt="primitive types" title="primitive types"/>
        This block's pull-down menu shows all of Snap<em>!</em>'s primitive types.</div>
        <p>Just as the name suggests, a <strong>data type</strong> is  what <em>kind</em> of data something is. 
    Each programming language provides some <strong>primitive</strong> (meaning "built in") <strong>data types</strong>. In Snap<em>!</em> the primitive types are <em>number</em>, <em>text string</em>, <em>list</em>, and some other types you haven't yet used as data.</p>
    <div class="takeNote">An <strong>abstract data type</strong> (or <strong>ADT</strong>) is a kind of data that's meaningful in your program, but not built into the language. You implement it as part of your program. <!-- Examples might be &quot;sentence&quot; in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/1-gossip.html">Unit 1 Lab 2</a> or &quot;angle&quot; in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/1-exploring-motion.html">Unit 1 Lab 3</a>. --> In <em>this</em> lab, the <em>point</em> is a useful ADT.</div>
        <p>
        The word "abstract" is often used casually as if it means something <em>harder</em> to understand, but in computer science, its meaning is almost the opposite. ADTs are things that you, the programmer, create to make your program <em>easier</em> for people to read, debug, and improve.</p>

        	<div class="stagedir">Gamal joins Betsy and Alphie's <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/1-the-for-each-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment"> discussion about using a list of coordinates to make a drawing of a letter</a>.</div>
        	<div><span>Gamal:</span> I was looking at our <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/go-to-point().png" height="40" alt="go-to-point()"> block and thought of a way to make it much easier to read.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Yeah, expressions like <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/item2ofpoint.png" height="40" alt="item(2)of-point" title="item(2)of-point">  are not very clear! Even after I wrote it to mean &quot;the <em>y</em> coordinate of the point,&quot; I had to think twice to make sure that the input was <em>one point</em>, instead of the whole list of coordinates of the letter A.</div>
<div class="sidenote">Gamal's idea is called <strong>data abstraction</strong>: creating a new ADT to bury the details. Users of points don't have to know that they're represented as lists.</div> 
			<div><span>Gamal:</span> That's the point! (Sorry about the pun.)		<code>item 2 of</code> something gives us a number—the <em>y</em>-coordinate—if  its input is a point, but gives us a <em>point</em>—a list of two numbers—if its input is a list of points. Let's make it clearer. We can define a <em>y</em>-coordinate block so that we can use code like <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/ycoordinateofpoint.png" height="40" alt="y-coordinate-of-(point)" title="y-coordinate-of-(point)"> instead of <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/item2ofpoint.png" height="40" alt="item(2)-of-(point)" title="item(2)-of-(point)">.</div>
          <div><span>Betsy:</span> That block is trivial; it isn't going to make the rest of the program any shorter. <code>Y coordinate</code> does the same thing as <code>item 2</code>!</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> Yes, but it'll  make the program easier to read and <em>easier to think about</em>. We can use <em>them</em> instead of <code> item </code> as inputs to the  <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y.png" alt="go to x: y:"> block.</div>
            <div class="stagedir">
                They build two  blocks <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/xcor.png" alt="x coordinate of (point); report item 1 of (point)"> 
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/ycor.png" alt="y coordinate of (point); report item 2 of (point)"><br />
          </div>
          <div> <span>Betsy:</span> Hmmm... So we could also make a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point()().png" alt="point () ()" title="point () ()" /> block  so that we can use <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point-list-for-A.png" height="80" alt="point-list-for-A"> instead of <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinate-list-for-A.png"  alt="coordinate-list-for-A">, which will make clearer what this list really is. 
          <div class="sidenoteBig">Note that the # symbols in the <code>point</code> block are not something you type but appear automatically when the Number input type is selected, as shown below.<br />  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/input-type-number.png"  height="80" alt=""/></div>

    <div class="takeNote">The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point()().png" alt="point () ()" title="point () ()" /> block is called the <strong>constructor</strong> of this new abstract data type.
