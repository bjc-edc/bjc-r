<!--        <p>A <strong>data type</strong> is a label that specifies what type of data a variable can hold. In some programming languages, there are different data types for numbers than for words&mdash;or even for different kinds of numbers (for instance, integers vs. decimals). In Snap<em>!</em>, there are variables (which each hold one piece of data that can be either a number or text) and lists (which hold multiple pieces of data&mdash;numbers or text). We can also create our own data types to help clarify our code.</p>  -->

			<strong>On this page</strong> you will create a new data type, <code>point</code>, to make your U2L2-DrawShape code easier to read, debug, and use.

        <div class="vocabBig">: binary sequence
        <p><em>Every</em> kind of information in the computer—whether it is a number, text, list, or an instruction to perform—is stored as a sequence of 0s and 1s (a <strong>binary sequence</strong>). So, for a program to work, the computer needs to be told how to interpret any such sequence of 0s and 1s.</p>
      </div>

        <p>Just as the name suggests, a <strong>data type</strong> is  what <em>kind</em> of data something is. 
    Each programming language provides some <strong>primitive</strong> (meaning "built in") <strong>data types</strong>. In Snap<em>!</em> the primitive types are <em>number</em>, <em>text string</em>, <em>list</em>, and some other types you haven't yet used  as data. (The <code>is () a ()?</code> block's pull-down menu shows all of Snap<em>!</em>'s primitive types.)</p>
        <p>An <strong>abstract data type</strong> (or <strong>ADT</strong>) is a kind of data that's meaningful in your program, but not built into the language. You implement it as part of your program. Examples might be &quot;sentence&quot; in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/1-gossip.html">Unit 1 Lab 2</a> or &quot;angle&quot; in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/1-exploring-motion.html">Unit 1 Lab 3</a>. In <em>this</em> lab, the <em>point</em> is a useful ADT.</p>
        <p>
            In other situations, the word "abstract" is often used to mean something <em>harder</em> to understand, but in computer science, its meaning is almost the opposite. ADTs are things that you, the programmer, create to make your program <em>easier</em> for people to read, debug, improve, and use.</p>

            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Yeah, expressions like <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item(2)of-coordinates.png" alt="item(2)of-coordinates"> can  get confusing!

<div class="sidenote">Gamal's idea is called <strong>data abstraction</strong>: creating a new abstract data type to hide the details from its users. In this case, users of points don't have to know that they're represented as lists.</div>

Let's define a new <em>data type</em> called <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point()().png" alt="point () ()" title="point () ()" /> that contains an <em>x</em>-coordinate and a <em>y</em>-coordinate so that we can use  <br />

            <div class="todo">I think this should be integrated into the previous page or perhaps done between pages (then students could  go back and edit the ones they have already made). --MF<br />
            ST-Paul wondered if this should just be done in lab2
            </div>
            <p>
                You may have noticed that input slots can have different shapes. This is because they accept different types of input. To change the input type:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Click the variable you want to edit</strong> from inside the Block Editor. In this case, click <var>numberOfLetters</var>.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong> Click the right triangle</strong> in the Edit Input Name pop-up box.<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/edit-variable-numberOfLetters.jpg" alt="Edit input name window with right triangle circled" title="Edit input name window with right triangle circled" />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Choose the input type</strong> that 	you want. For <var>numberOfLetters</var>, select Number. Then click OK on both the Edit Input Name and Block Editor windows. <br />
                        <!--Not relevant here. 
                        <div class="sidenote">You can also specify a <em>default</em> value for the variable if you like. This is how the <code>move</code> block always starts as <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move-10-steps.png"  alt="move 10 steps"> and not just <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move-steps.png" alt="move steps">.</div>

                The <em>shape</em> of the variable's input slot tells people what type of input the block expects for that variable.

            <div><span>Gamal:</span> Yes, but it is going to make the program easier to read and <em>easier to think about</em>. Now, a list of points will actually look like a list of points:</div>

            <div>
   	    
        <span>Betsy:</span> Hmmm... So we could also make <code>X coordinate</code> and <code>Y coordinate</code> blocks so that the  <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y.png" alt="go to x: y:">block  would use code like <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/Y-coordinate-of-(coordinates).png" alt="Y-coordinate-of-(coordinates)"> instead of <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item(2)of(coordinates).png" alt="Y-coordinate-of-(coordinates)">, which was confusing too. </div>
