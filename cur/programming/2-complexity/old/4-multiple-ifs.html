				<li>REVISION NOTES: This page is arbitrary and scattered, but can stay as is for now. </li>
				<li>JK: In the Teacher notes for this lab, I would suggest that teachers display their grid and show #5 and #6 if students don't get absolute value. And I would also suggest that they not TEACH absolute value (as they might in algebra) because it's really more about distance not the boring algebra stuff. Actually, I might revise the sidenote and NOT talk about abs(-10) being 10 so much as showing a picture. Maybe say "-10 and 10 are both a distance of 10 from 0 so <code>abs of -10</code> and <code>abs of 10</code> are both 10" with a number line picture?</li>
				<li>Why does <span class="snap">snap</span> use "say" instead of "report"? <strong>PG: Many problems here. (1) People expect "say" to make a sound, not just print. This will almost certainly come up in classes and has already come up in PD workshops. (2) (2) Jane's point is about how to help people understand the difference in meaning between what, on the surface, appears just to be a matter of <em>where</em> the print appears. I'm tempted to rename the primitives <code>speech balloon</code> and <code>thought balloon</code>, which completely deals with the sound-v-print problem and probably mostly deals with the question Jane called attention to. Explain this in a teacher note with something like: <code>say</code> tells <em>us</em> information by making the sprite display that information on the stage, but it does not report a value that another procedure can use. <code>report</code> reports a value and, depending on what is done with the value, may or may not show that value to <em>us</em>.</strong></li>

                	Click on the image below to load stoplight costumes. Make a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/traffic-signal.png" alt="traffic signal ()"/> block that when given the words "red," "yellow," or "green," changes the sprite's costume to the correct color. For example, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/traffic-signal-green.png" alt="traffic signal ('green')"/> should turn the light green. Decide what should happen if your <code>traffic signal</code> block receives something <em>other</em> than "red," "yellow," or "green" as input.<br />
