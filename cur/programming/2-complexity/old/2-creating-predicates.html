		<h2>Creating and Using Predicates</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
        	NOTE: There were numbering issues on this page at one point. This has been fixed, so the references below may not be correct. --MF
            <ul>
                <li>On TTA, I have run into countless teachers who insist that "zero is neither odd nor even." We should probably clarify that zero is even in the TG. --MF</li>
                <li>In TG, also clarify that the a/an rule the students are using are about spelling, and the real English rule is about pronunciation: we say <em>an</em> umbrella but <em>a</em> unicorn, and we say <em>a</em> house, but <em>an </em>hour. This doesn't need to be said in class, or taught to students, but is something the teacher should be aware of <em>if</em> it comes up. Or it could be a introduction into how very complicated language processing is and how much programs like Siri must know in order to get things right.</li>
            </ul>
            Notes from Al on U2L1P2–6:
            <ul>
            	<li>``To make progress with Tic Tac Toe, your program needs to \emph{control} which action happens at which time. Control blocks are the topic of this page.''     But the title of the page is about predicates.  And this sentence makes it seem as if control is a new thing, but the previous page is all about control.  There's just a lot of vocabulary---conditional, control, predicate, \dots.  Here, I think the new idea is that they are going to create blocks of their own that happen to be predicates.  Ah---so that's what the title is trying to say.  Then just rework the opener.</li>
                <li>``mini project about English words''  \emph{What is it?}  Show an example of what they are going to be able to do at the end.</li>
                <li>Overall, the page is too long and cluttered.   Why not start with problem 4?  The \emph{even} predicate isn't used anywhere.</li>
                <li>Problem 7 doesn't seem to belong here.  It's more like U1L4.</li>
                <li>
                	I'll start over:  By now they've built custom blocks.  The new ideas here are (I think)
                	<ol>
                		<li>Creating predicates---thinking of functions that return true or false</li>
                        <li>Control---thinking of how to manage more than one condition</li>
                        <li>Intro to data abstraction and manipulation---thinking of  a collection of things as one thing (a list)</li>
                        <li>A sneaky intro to recursion without a lot of fanfare.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>If so (and that's more than enough for one part of a lab), let's narrow the contexts and keep the focus on how to develop these 4 things.  Suggest:  assigning the correct article to a word and making plurals.  So, all the graphics and discussion of mod can be moved to U1L4 (or deleted).  The multiple if statements can be  developed in the context of deciding if a letter is a vowel.</li>
            </ul>
		</div>
        <div class="todo">From Observation Notes Analysis: 
        	<ul>
            	<li>U2L1: "…they had a lot of trouble with the a/an block…"</li>
                <li>MOD: "It might be useful to describe "mod m" initially in context (before the long remainder thing) as something like "every m whatevers." They’ve already seen (and apparently understood) mod 2 as a way to determine even numbers, but didn’t generalize the right way. Partly, this may be the general lousiness of 2 as an example of anything (because 2+2=2x2=2^2, etc., and because "mod 2" makes it feel like it, all by itself, might mean "even" without really noticing the equals 0 part), but it may also be because they’re not seeing cyclic stuff (or pretty much anything) in remainders. "</li>

       	<p>To make progress with Tic Tac Toe, your program needs to  <em>control</em> which action happens at which time. Control blocks are the topic of this page. You will also start a new mini-project about  English words and simple phrases that will give you practice with <em>conditional statements</em> and with breaking complex tasks into meaningful parts.</p>

		<!--  <div class="sidenoteBig">There are different traditions on how to name predicates.  Using question marks in the name, as in <code>even?</code>, is hard to miss, but some people don't like it because in English the question mark would go at the end: <code>is (n) even?</code>. And in any case English questions don't go after the word <code>if</code>. But don't try too hard to read or write any programming language as if it were English.</div> -->

                    <p>To create realistic dialogues, a program  needs to adjust some words to fit others. For example, it needs to know  when to use <em><strong>a </strong></em> or <em><strong> an</strong></em>.  <strong><em>A</em></strong> peach or <strong><em>an</em></strong> peach?  <strong><em>A</em></strong> apple or <strong><em>an</em></strong> apple?</p>
					<p>To decide, it  needs a predicate that tests the next letter to see if it's a vowel. It should work like this:</p>
					<p><img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/newvowel.gif" alt="predicate vowel? tests e and reports true, and tests b and reports false"></p>
					<p>There are many ways to create a block like this. Here's one way, started for you. </p>
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">
						Because <code>vowel?</code> outputs only <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, remember to choose the hexagonal <strong>predicate</strong> shape when you first define the block.
