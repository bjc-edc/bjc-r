        <h2>Clicking Points to Capture Coordinates</h2>
  <!--      <div class="todo">ST-I don't think this page belongs here.  This will not help the students for the task they need to prepare for, the Mandala.  It may belong to U3 if we end up doing the "simple studio" project (my interview submission) for which this could be a prelude.  Also looking at your solution, I see some non-trivial steps, -not just the recursive "all of" predicate, but overall subtle sequencing of code-  I don't see how the kids will succeed with this little help.</div>   -->
        <div class="learn">
On the previous pages, you drew a shape based on a list of points you were given.  <strong>On this page,</strong> you will automate the process of getting coordinates by clicking on the desired points on the screen.

                <p>ST-Suggested replacement:".....Why can't we just draw a letter on the screen by clicking on the corner points that define the letter?"</p>
                <p>Again, I don't think it's realistic to click on the screen freehand. On the previous page they drew their A on graph paper first. --bh</p>

            <div><span>Morgan:</span> Typing  all these coordinates is a pain.  Why can't we just sketch the letters on the screen, and then click on the corners?</div>
             <!--<div class="todo">
               <p>ST-This next comment by Jasmine feels a bit unrealistic, no one will try to draw on a screen or use tracing paper on a screen.<br />Suggestion: Jasmine: "Great idea, how could we do that?"</p>
               <p>Selim: If you look at my ugly, ragged E, it's that way because I just eyeballed the vertices instead of having an actual printed E to work from. On the previous page, they draw an A on graph paper before entering the coordinates. I think it's absolutely realistic that kids would hold that graph in front of the screen to get the vertices right! --bh</p>

              <div><span>Jasmine:</span> Umm, I think they won't like us drawing on the screen.  But we could find a picture of what we want to trace and import it as a stage background. We'll have to write a block that keeps waiting for a mouse click, and then adds those mouse coordinates to a list.  When all the points have been entered, the block should report the list of points.<br />

There are so many comments and there are blocks out on the stage that it says we need to use, though some have already been used in the program, so it's not clear to me that I (as student) actually need to use them in my program still. It's also really hard to read and meaningfully analyze half-written code like this because I have to keep bouncing back and forth between the code and the comments. --MF, 5/18/17</div>-->

                    <strong>Think and write: </strong><em>Read</em> the code inside the <code>list of points</code> reporter, and try to understand its structure.  For example:
                  <ul>
                        <li>Why is it a reporter? Since it draws the shape as you click on its corners, isn't the job done? Why should it report a value?</li>
                        <li>It uses a <code>forever</code> block.  When, and how, does it report a value?</li>
                        <li>What is the <code>if else</code> block testing, and why?</li>
                        <div class="todo"> obsolete:
<li>Can you use a script variable for the list inside <code>list of points</code>, or does it have to be global?</li></div>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test your block several times and debug any problems.                </li>
                <li>Try saving the output of <code>list of points</code> in a global variable and using your <code>draw points</code> to recreate the shape you drew. Debug any problems.</li>

                    <p><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Notice how convenient it is to have <code>point</code>, <code>y coordinate of</code>, <code>go to point</code>, <code>draw from point to point</code>, etc., already built to use the <strong>point</strong> abstract data type. Once you've created a point from the mouse coordinates, you never have to think about coordinates again in this activity.</p>
