        <div class="todo">
            <p>Will need edits for inclusion in U2. --MF 3/10/17</p>
            <p>From Selim: “more complicated who” and “more complicated gossip” quite a few times generate simple statements, potentially confusing as not clear what is more complicated about them.</p>
        </div>
		<div class="learn">
            <p>The gossip varies, but its <em>structure</em> is always the same: &nbsp; <code>&nbsp;who</code>, <code>&nbsp;does what</code>, <code>&nbsp;who</code>. </p>
            <p><strong>What you will do: </strong> Improve your program so, <em>sometimes</em>, the sentences are a bit longer and more complex.</p>
            <p><strong>What you will learn: </strong> Use <code>if...else...</code> to control the behavior of a program.<div class="comment">AC:  Actually, they've used control in L1 in a TIF.  But I think that's OK.</div></p>
        </div>
<h3>Using <code>if...else...</code> to control a block's behavior</h3>
        The block <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/more-complicated-who.png" alt="more complicated who"> has been built for you. It randomly chooses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. <strong>IF</strong> the number is greater than 4, it reports something more complicated than <code>who</code>. <strong>ELSE</strong> it reports  <code>who</code>, just as  before. This algorithm produces a more complex sentence about one third of the time.
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">  
        <ol>
        	<li> Open your U1L2-Gossip file.</li>
			<li>Find <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/more-complicated-who.png" alt="more complicated who">, drag it into the scripting area, and click on enough to see how it's different from <code>who</code>.</li>
            <li>Edit it to see how it works. The comments may help.</li>
          </ol>
           </div>
           <div class="assessment-data" type="multiplechoice" identifier="How can you get a complicated subject more often?"
            hasinlinefeedback="true" maxchoices="1" responseIdentifier="U1L2ri1" shuffle="false">
            <div class="prompt">
              <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/more-complicated-who-script.png" alt="more-complicated-who-script" title="more-complicated-who-script" />
                Here is the script inside <code>more complicated who</code>. What change to this script will make the more complicated phrase more often?
            </div>
            <div class="choice" identifier="c1">
                <div class="text">(a) Change the 4 to 5.</div>
                <div class="feedback">
                Only <em>one</em> number chosen randomly from 1 through 6 will be greater than 5. That will happen <em>less</em> often, so we'll have a complicated subject less often.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="choice" identifier="c2">
                <div class="text">(b) Change the 6 to 4.</div>
                <div class="feedback">
                    Then the chosen number can <em>never</em> be greater than 4, and we'll <em>never</em> get a complicated subject. 
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="choice" identifier="c3">
                <div class="text">(c) Change the 6 to 8.</div>
                <div class="feedback">
                    That does increase the chance that the chosen number will be greater than  4, and therefore that the subject will be more complicated. 
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="choice" identifier="c4">
                <div class="text">(d) Change the 1 to 4.</div>
                <div class="feedback">
                    The chosen number can then be 4, 5, or 6, so we'll get a more complicated subject two-thirds of the time instead of one-third of the time. 
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="choice" identifier="c5">
                <div class="text">(e) Both (a) and (b).</div>
                <div class="feedback">
                    Those will both make the more complicated subject happen less often. If you're not sure why, click those answers to get more feedback.

                <div class="feedback">
                    Yes, both make the more complicated subject happen more often. If you're not sure why, click those answers to get more feedback.
