<p>In this series of Tic Tac Toe projects, you will build three versions of the game, each version making the computer’s involvement in the game more intelligent than the version before:</p>

<table style="width:1000px">

<td >Basic <em>Human versus Human</em> game where the computer simply displays the X’s and O’s but the users themselves decide on a win or a draw.

<td width="250"><img  data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/TTT2Animation.gif"  height="200" alt=""/></td>
<td><em>Human versus Human</em> game where the computer decides on a win or a draw.  In this version, the computer starts gaining awareness of the game and begins to meaningfully contribute to the game. <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/new/6c-newTTT-phase2-interactive.html" target="_blank">Tic Tac Toe Phase 2 example</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="80" style="text-align:center">Phase3</td>
<td width="250"><img  data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/TTT1_img/TTT3Animation.gif" height="200" alt=""/></td>
<td><em>Human versus Computer</em> game where the computer not only decides on a win or a draw but it also has some AI (Artificial Intelligence) features that allow it to “think” about a proper next move and simulate the moves of an intelligent human opponent. <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/new/6d-newTTT-phase3-interactive.html" target="_blank">Tic Tac Toe Phase 3 example</a>.<br /><br />

<strong>Note</strong>: In the last version, even though the computer will be aware of the nuances of the game, it will <strong>not</strong>  be unbeatable.  As an extension activity, you will be encouraged to develop an AI that is unbeatable at Tic Tac Toe.  Such AI, while fun to code, will not be so much fun to play against.</td>
