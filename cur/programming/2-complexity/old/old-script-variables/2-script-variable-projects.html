                <li>GH Feedback 9/14/15: I fear that the functional programming examples will be lost without a lecture to accompany them, and I wonder whether it makes logical sense to do that at this point in the course. I love all of the higher-order function examples, but I would defer them to HOF-specific parts of the online course.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 10/8/15: The 1st sentence for Linguistic Research appears ungrammatical. Do you mean the block is to determine which letter occurs more often?</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 11/14/15: The way the "fill with color" block works needs to be tweaked to make the Mondrian project work properly. This should be mentioned on the page.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 11/14/15: A discussion or mini-lesson about Unicode should be included before the "Secret Code" project</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 11/25/15: for number 5 factorial should be a reporter block instead of a command block because later in the problem factorial block is used as a reporter block</li>

                <li>U2L2: "For the crypt-decrypt project, most of the kids, to my surprise, first used <code>split by</code> letter to turn their message string into a list of characters.  Of course, since they don’t know how to process lists yet, the next things that they did were all over the place.  Some worked in an ugly way; some didn’t work at all; all were probably just what we’d rather not see.  One, however, was so perfectly structured except for the actual encoding of each item of the list that I showed the boy <code>map</code> as the solution to the one missing step.  He got it and used it correctly, but we won’t know until we see him apply it elsewhere whether he’s got the idea.  I don’t think anyone peeled off a character, found its unicode, processed that, turned it back to a letter, and then pasted it back into a growing string.  Without lists, that would seem the "obvious" thing to do.  With lists in a real way, they’d split, map a process, and combine.  In their odd interim state—where did they get the idea to split?—it didn’t feel coherent at all."</li>

                    <strong>Mondrian art project:</strong> The Dutch artist Piet Mondrian is possibly best known for his artwork using brightly colored rectangles.
                    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/tableau-1-piet-mondrian.png" width="300" alt="Tableau_I,_by_Piet_Mondriaan, from Wikimedia Commons"> "Tableau 1" by Piet Mondrian</p>
                    <p>Mondrian wasn't at all random in his choice of colors and locations, but even some random choices can be interesting. A <span class="snap">snap</span> script can produce designs like these. </p>

                    <div class="sidenote">This isn't the actual Snap<em>!</em> program.  You could write custom blocks with these names, but they're a little verbose to use as real block names, especially that two-line one in the middle.  This algorithm is for you to read, not for a computer to read.</div>
                    This algorithm  produced those designs:<br />

                    To keep your code clear, you may want to create separate blocks that specialize in boundary and fill and choosing locations and calculating size.<br />
                    <div class="takeNote">
	                    <div class="sidenoteBig">If you've been working with the version of this project that uses Snap<em>!</em>'s <code>fill</code> block, you can find that version <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/old-script-variables/mondrian-details.html">here</a>. Although, some people have found the way that block works to be frustrating for this project. </div>
                    	One way to make a <code>fill with random color</code> block is: <br />

                        Another way is to draw a single line with a very wide width (using "flat line ends" from the Snap<em>!</em> Settings menu) and then drawing a rectangle around it.

                                <li><code>draw outer frame</code> uses a thick pen size to draw a black rectangle of the size you want for your work of art.</li>
                                    <li><code>fill with random color</code> sets  sprite inside that rectangle, sets  a random color, and uses Snap<em>!</em>'s <code>fill</code> block to color the rectangle.</li>

                            It is an &quot;outline&quot; because most of the blocks have no scripts in them. You will have to edit them to tell them how to do their job. 
                            <p>This script uses two blocks that you may not have used before. When you draw a rectangle with <code>draw rectangle</code>, you will need to give it values for the <var>height</var> and <var>width</var>. The <code>script variables</code> block tells the computer it must keep track of two variables, and it gives those variables the name you want them to have. The <code>set</code> block lets you <em>set</em> the values of those variables. In this case, you'll have to write some code that gives them reasonable values that change randomly, but don't run over the edge of the outer frame.</p>

          <li>In order to do this, you will need to be able to change a letter into a number, add 1 to that number, and then change the new number back to a letter.

                    <strong>Old-fashioned divisibility test—divisibility by 3 or 9: </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a helper reporter <code>digit sum</code> that adds up the digits in a number.  So, for example <code>digit sum 7</code> should report 7, and <code>digit sum 12</code> should report 3, and <code>digit sum 126</code> should report 9 (the sum of 1, 2 and 6).  You may find these blocks useful. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/letter-i-of-number.png" alt="fletter-i-of-number"> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/for-i=1-to-length-of-number.png" alt="for-i=1-to-length-of-number"></li>
                        <li>Then write <code>repeated digit sum</code>, which keeps taking the <code>digit sum</code> until the result is a single digit. For example, the digit sum of 238 is 2+3+8=13, which is more than a single digit. The digit sum of 13 is 1+3=4, which <em>is</em> a single digit. So the repeated digit sum of 238 is 4.</li>
                        <li>
                            Write predicates <code>divisible by 3?</code> and <code>divisible by 9?</code>. A number is divisible by 3 if its repeated digit sum is 0, 3, 6, or 9; it's divisible by 9 if its digit sum is 0 or 9.
                            <ul>

        <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/converse.png" alt="conversation with ASK AND WAIT" />
<p>Note that this script has <em>two </em>script variables. The <code>script variables</code> block has a little right-arrow at the end:</p>
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/arrowhead.png" alt="arrowhead in block" />
        <p>If you click the arrowhead, a second orange variable oval will appear. Also, there will be left- and right-facing arrowheads. You can click these to adjust the number of variables you need.</p>
        <p>The join block also has arrowheads to control the number of input slots it has. In the text string inputs, both in <code>join</code> and in the <code>ask</code> blocks, the pale brown raised dots represent spaces. The brown dots don&rsquo;t appear in the text on the stage when the script is run. They&rsquo;re in the input slots so that you can easily see if there are multiple spaces in a row:</p>
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/multispace.png" alt="text input with multiple spaces in a row" />
        <p>and also so that you can distinguish between a completely empty input slot and one that has a space in it:</p>
