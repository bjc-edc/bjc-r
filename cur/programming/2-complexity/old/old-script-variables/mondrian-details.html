				<li>Click on this image to load a script that is the outline of the algorithm that produced those designs. <div class="sidenoteBig">This list says what each block that you must edit and define should do. Think about when you want  pen up and pen down.
                    <ul>
                    <li><code>draw outer frame</code> uses a thick pen size to draw a black rectangle of the size you want for your work of art.</li>
                        <li><code>fill with random color</code> sets  sprite inside that rectangle, sets  a random color, and uses Snap<em>!</em>'s <code>fill</code> block to color the rectangle.</li>
                        <li>Choose <code>repeat</code>'s number (yourself) to say how many colorful rectangles. </li>
                        <li><code>go to random location</code> could use <code>go to x: y:</code>.</li>
                        <li><code>set height</code> and <code>set width</code> should use <code>pick random</code>, but with limits based on Sprite's location, so the colorful rectangles fit in the frame. </li>
                        <li>Draw a rectangle of the height and width you calculated.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div> 
                It is an &quot;outline&quot; because most of the blocks have no scripts in them. You will have to edit them to tell them how to do their job. 
                <p>This script uses two blocks that you may not have used before. When you draw a rectangle with <code>draw rectangle</code>, you will need to give it values for the <var>height</var> and <var>width</var>. The <code>script variables</code> block tells the computer it must keep track of two variables, and it gives those variables the name you want them to have. The <code>set</code> block lets you <em>set</em> the values of those variables. In this case, you'll have to write some code that gives them reasonable values that change randomly, but don't run over the edge of the outer frame.</p>
                </li>
