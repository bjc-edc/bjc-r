		<h2>More "Message" Passing</h2>
        <p>We are all quite familiar with the green flag icon, but what is it actually doing when we use it to start a program?  The green flag can in fact be seen as a special kind of broadcast.  When we click the green flag icon at the top right of the screen this sends out a "message" that tells any script with a green flag hat block to start executing.  You can think of the green flag button as a radio station broadcasting on a particular channel. Then only scripts who are tuned to that channel (i.e. have a green flag hat block) will receive the message. This same idea of message passing can be seen in the scripts below:</p>
        <div class="sidenote">Whether we start a script by clicking the green flag button, using broadcast, or through keyboard input we are always using message passing even though it may not always be obvious.</div>
