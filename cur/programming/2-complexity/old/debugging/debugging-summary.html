    	<strong>ST EK List: We cover these (somewhat) here in the Reference page (which is a collection of all the dispersed debugging material):</strong><br />
        
    	5.1.2D Program documentation helps programmers develop and maintain correct programs to efficiently solve problems. (with documentation)	<br />
       5.1.2E Documentation about program components, such as segments and procedures, helps in developing and maintaining programs. (with documentation)<br />		
       5.1.2F Documentation helps in developing and maintaining programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. (with documentation)<br />	
        5.4.1H Visual displays (or different modalities) of program state can help in finding errors. (with visual stepping)<br />
        <br /><br />
       
        <strong> These EK's still need to be covered somewhere</strong><br />
       
       5.1.2H Consultation and communication with program users is an important aspect of program development to solve problems. (2.1.2.7 add #7: "get someone else to try your program. Then ask them whether there is anything that is confusing or anything you could improve.)<br />
       5.1.2I A programmer's knowledge and skill affects how a program is developed and how it is used to solve a problem.	(On debugging summary page: "Don't feel as if you are supposed to find it trivial to debug. programmers take years to get better at debugging. You are a beginning. It's ok.)<br />
       5.4.1A Program style can affect the determination of program correctness. ()<br />
        5.4.1D Longer code segments are harder to reason about than shorter code segments in a program.	 (but with BH's abstraction stuff.)<br />
       
        5.4.1I Programmers justify and explain a program's correctness.	<br />
        5.4.1J Justification can include a written explanation about how a program meets its specifications. (5.3.1.1 where we ask them to explain their algorithm. make them write down instead of just discuss.)<br />
        5.4.1K Correctness of a program depends on correctness of program components, including code segments and procedures. (part of debugging is to debug the pieces. Add to brick wall)<br />
        5.4.1L An explanation of a program helps people understand the functionality and purpose of it.	 (with documentation; add program notes to contact list project; also add to list of snap features below)<br />
        5.4.1M The functionality of a program is often described by how a user interacts with it.	(do as part of addressing 5.4.1L)<br />
        5.4.1N The functionality of a program is best described at a high level by what the program does, not at the lower level of how the program statements work to accomplish this.	(do as part of addressing 5.4.1L)<br />

        <h4><strong>What is Debugging?</strong></h4> 
        Debugging is the art of identifying errors in computer programs and finding  ways of resolving them.<br /><br />
        
        
        <h4><strong>Debugging Principles</strong></h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Recognize the existence of a bug. </li>
        <li>When you experience a bug, do <em>not</em> delete your project and start over.</li>
        <li>Reproduce several times the error that the bug creates. </li>
        <li>Isolate the piece of code producing the error.</li>
        <li>Identify the specific cause of the error within that code.</li>
		<li>Debug by subtraction not addition.  That is do not add code that works around the bug.</li>
        <li>Fix the error.</li>
        <li>Test thoroughly including consideration of special cases.</li>
        <li>Keep a log of bugs you encounter throughout the year and add any new bugs found to this log.  Include in the log any test cases that helped you identify the bugs.</li>
        <li>Love your bugs!  They give you insight into programming and a make you better at it!</li>
        </ul><br />

			You can use <code>pause all</code> to place breaks in your code so you can see what's happening along the way. In this animation, the programmer runs their code with <code>pause all</code> inside it and then clicks the yellow Run/Pause button next to the Green Flag (<img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/play-button.png" alt="play button" title="play button"/>/<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pause_button.png" alt="pause button" title="pause button"/>) to move through the code up until a <code>pause</code> block is reached again. In this example, there is only one script running, but <code>pause all</code> will pause <em>every</em> script that is running until the yellow Run/Pause button is clicked.<br />

			<h4><strong>Debugging with Visible Stepping</strong></h4>
			
            <p>Snap<em>!</em> has a debugging tool called <strong>Visible Stepping</strong> that allows you to control how quickly Snap<em>!</em> steps through the blocks of your code. This lets you see the effect of each block one-by-one to help you understand any errors in your code.</p>
           
                <p>After clicking the Visible Stepping button (<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/visible-stepping.png" alt="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" title="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" />), you can adjust the slider to control the stepping speed.

                <p>If you move the slider to the slowest setting (all the way to the left), the shape of the yellow Run/Pause button will change, and you can press it to <em>single step</em> through your code. This can help you see what happens at a specific point.</p>

                      <p>
                            When you are debugging your code, it can help to see the value of a variable at different points in your program. There are several ways to do this:
          <ul>
                                <li>You can <strong>click the variable block</strong> (like <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/answer.png" alt="the answer block" title="the answer block" />) occasionally to report it's current value.</li>
                                <li>If it's a global variable, you can <strong>mark the check-box</strong> beside it in the palette (<img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/answer-checked.png" alt="answer block with check-box checked" title="answer block with check-box checked" />) to have a <em>watcher</em> display on the stage (as shown in the animation below).</li>
                                <li>If it's a local (script) variable, you can <strong>use the <code>show variable</code> block</strong> to display a  watcher on the stage (and use <code>hide variable</code> to hide it again). (This is also shown in the following animation.)</li>
          </ul>
                        </p>

            <h4><strong>Debugging Tip: Organizing Your Code</strong></h4>
            
            <p>
                A great way to avoid having bugs in your program in the first place is to keep your code organized by deleting any unused blocks to avoid clutter. Here are examples of messy code and neatly organized code with comments. If you came back to your project after a few days, which code do you think would be easier to debug?<br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/messy-code.png" width="550" alt="Example of messy code with loose scripts all over the place." title="Example of messy code with loose scripts all over the place."/><br />

            </p>
            
            <p>
                You can use the <strong>clean up</strong> option by right-clicking in the Scripts area to organize and arrange your blocks vertically.  You can remove a block or script either by dragging it out of the scripting area and back to the palettes on the left or by choosing "delete" option from the drop-down menu as shown below. Note that this is different from the "delete block definition" option which will permanently delete a custom block and all its instances from your entire project.<br />
                <img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/cleanup-deleting.gif"  height="500" alt="Animation about deleting blocks by dragging them off to the palette or by choosing the delete option by right-clicking." title="Animation about deleting blocks by dragging them off to the palette or by choosing the delete option by right-clicking."/>

        </div>
       
       </div>
       
       </li>
       <li>Use sensible naming of variables. Take advantage of Snap<em>!</em>'s flexibility with variable names including use of spaces.
       <a href="#hint-variable-name" data-toggle="collapse" title="Variable naming in Snap!">  Click for examples of variable naming.</a>
       
        <div id="hint-variable-name" class="collapse">  Below you see an example of a poor choice of a variable name (which will confuse even the programmer) and a good choice of name for the same variable in Snap<em>!</em>.  <br />

        Note that unlike in block-based languages (Scratch, Snap<em>!</em>), in text-based programming languages (Python, Java, etc.) you may not be able to use spaces in variable names.
        </div>
        </li>
       <li>Use abstraction to hide complexity of code.
