       5.1.2D Program documentation helps programmers develop and maintain correct programs to efficiently solve problems. (with documentation)	<br />
       5.1.2E Documentation about program components, such as segments and procedures, helps in developing and maintaining programs. (with documentation)<br />		
       5.1.2F Documentation helps in developing and maintaining programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. (with documentation)<br />	
       5.1.2H Consultation and communication with program users is an important aspect of program development to solve problems. (2.1.2.7 add #7: "get someone else to try your program. Then ask them whether there is anything that is confusing or anything you could improve.)<br />
       5.1.2I A programmer's knowledge and skill affects how a program is developed and how it is used to solve a problem.	(On debugging summary page: "Don't feel as if you are supposed to find it trivial to debug. programmers take years to get better at debugging. You are a beginning. It's ok.)<br />
       5.4.1A Program style can affect the determination of program correctness. ()<br />
        5.4.1D Longer code segments are harder to reason about than shorter code segments in a program.	 (but with BH's abstraction stuff.)<br />
        5.4.1H Visual displays (or different modalities) of program state can help in finding errors. (with visual stepping)<br />
        5.4.1I Programmers justify and explain a program's correctness.	<br />
        5.4.1J Justification can include a written explanation about how a program meets its specifications. (5.3.1.1 where we ask them to explain their algorithm. make them write down instead of just discuss.)<br />
        5.4.1K Correctness of a program depends on correctness of program components, including code segments and procedures. (part of debugging is to debug the pieces. Add to brick wall)<br />
        5.4.1L An explanation of a program helps people understand the functionality and purpose of it.	 (with documentation; add program notes to contact list project; also add to list of snap features below)<br />
        5.4.1M The functionality of a program is often described by how a user interacts with it.	(do as part of addressing 5.4.1L)<br />
        5.4.1N The functionality of a program is best described at a high level by what the program does, not at the lower level of how the program statements work to accomplish this.	(do as part of addressing 5.4.1L)<br />

        <h4>What is Debugging?</h4> 
        Debugging is the art of identifying errors in computer programs and finding  ways of resolving them.<br /><br />
        
        <div class="commentBig">
        <p>Overall, I love the content on this page. I'm so glad we are getting this into the course. Thank you, Selim!</p>
        <p>Mostly, my concerns are around the pedagogy of dropping all these ideas on the student all at once. I don't think that will lead to learning these principles or assimilating them as practices. I think we should be introducing these ideas one at a time in the context of projects where each specific strategy will be helpful. We could <em>summarize</em> the ideas on a single page at the end of the unit, but I think that would be a <em>secondary</em> priority to integrating these into useful contexts where students can see the benefit of using these strategies and get some practice. --MF, 3/5/18</p>

        <h4>Debugging Principles </h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Recognize the existence of a bug </li>
        <li>Reproduce several times the error that the bug creates </li>
        <li>Isolate the piece of code producing the error</li>
        <li>Identify the specific cause of the error within that code</li>
		<li>Debug by subtraction not addition.  That is do not add code that works around the bug</li>
        <li><s>Fix the error</s></li>
        <li>Test thoroughly including consideration of special cases (Note: Should be move down under good programming habits; it's an anti-bugging strategy)</li>
        <li>Keep a log of bugs you encounter throughout the year and add any new bugs found to this log.  Include in the log any test cases that helped you identify the bugs.</li>
        <li>Love your bugs!  They give you insight into programming and a make you better at it!
        <div class="todo">
            Thoughts from Brian:
            <ul>
                <li>Say early: "When you experience a bug, do not delete your project and start over."</li>
                <li>The above list items are not all at the same level of abstraction. Maybe a list isn't the right thing. Maybe a little story would be better&mdash;something that shows how to approach debugging. Maybe call it "list of debugging practices" and make it a link.</li>
                <li>Meta-advice: we can't ever predict the kind of bugs that will actually happen.</li>

          <p>Brian suggests adding such data to a list rather than using <code>say</code>. Mary suggests doing both; <code>say</code> can be taught earlier (in U1L3) and the list approach can be added to the strategy after kids have learned about them. --MF, 3/5/18</p>

During the stepping, the color of the block currently being executed changes to <span style="color:#00F5F5">cyan</span>.  Notice how stepping is done when there is a loop within a loop.  If there is an error in your code, stepping will help you to identify the block(s) causing the error.</p>

       </div>

       You can delete any unused block by dragging it out of the scripting area or by using the <em>delete</em> option in its context menu.  If you wish to permanently remove a custom block you have created and all of its instances, you can choose the <em>delete block definition</em> option from its context menu.<br />

       <div class="todo">
       <p>This one is a little risky. Plenty of programmers (ahem, me included) use abbreviations like on the left. In text-based languages (like many/most of the languages that kids will use after this class), it's nicer not to have to type a long name repeatedly. Some programming interfaces have auto-complete, but others don't. I don't think this is a general principle that we should teach. I suggest we cut this one. --MF, 3/5/18</p>

        <p>Yes! This is a core idea of U2, and we could even introduce it in U1L3. But, wait, is this really a principle of debugging? I guess, if we split this all up, it won't matter. I tend to briefly <em>add</em> bugs when I abstract something I realize would be better abstracted. ;) --MF, 3/5/18</p>
