  <!--      <div class="todo">ST-I don't think this page belongs here.  This will not help the students for the task they need to prepare for, the Mandala.  It may belong to U3 if we end up doing the "simple studio" project (my interview submission) for which this could be a prelude.  Also looking at your solution, I see some non-trivial steps, -not just the recursive "all of" predicate, but overall subtle sequencing of code-  I don't see how the kids will succeed with this little help.</div>   -->
        <div class="learn">
        	On the previous page, you drew a shape based on a list of points you were given.  <strong>On this page,</strong> you will automate the process of getting coordinates by clicking on the desired points on the screen.

        <div class="todo">
          <p>Is this an example of how we want these "learn" boxes to look? I thought there was supposed to be more about <em>learning</em>. --MF, 5/23/17</p>
          <p>It <em>is</em> about learning! It just doesn't use the <em>word</em> &quot;learning.&quot;--bh</p>

            <p>ST-Suggested replacement:".....Why can't we just draw a letter on the screen by clicking on the corner points that define the letter?"</p>
            <p>Again, I don't think it's realistic to click on the screen freehand. On the previous page they drew their A on graph paper first. --bh</p>

            <!--<div class="todo">
            <p>ST-This next comment by Betsy feels a bit unrealistic, no one will try to draw on a screen or use tracing paper on a screen.<br />Suggestion: Betsy: "Great idea, how could we do that?"</p>
            <p>Selim: If you look at my ugly, ragged E, it's that way because I just eyeballed the vertices instead of having an actual printed E to work from. On the previous page, they draw an A on graph paper before entering the coordinates. I think it's absolutely realistic that kids would hold that graph in front of the screen to get the vertices right! --bh</p>

        <p>You will  combine parts of two projects: your work from the <strong>U2L2-DrawShape</strong> project you saved on the previous page, and a starter project for this page.</p>
        <em>Export <strong>U2L2-DrawShape</strong> blocks</em>
        <ol><li>Load your <strong>U2L2-DrawShape</strong> project.</li>
        <li>Choose "Export blocks" from the File menu to save the blocks on your computer.  (Save all the blocks.)</li></ol>

                <li> 
Load  <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2L2-Click.xml">this starter project</a>.  Below the actual stage are a "Stage" button and a &quot;Sprite&quot; button. Click the stage button.<br />

                <li>
                    Now click the "Backgrounds" tab near the top of the window.<br />

                    You will find two non-empty backgrounds:
                   <ul>
                        <li>A  graph of median U.S. household income by year (source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis) </li>
                        <li>A capital "E" (font: Century Gothic Bold).</li>
                    </ul>
                    The graph is typical of data processing, which is one topic of Unit 3.  The E continues the activity from the previous page.  Choose either background by clicking on it.
                (Later, you can also drag some other picture of a graph or letter into the project with the stage selected to get a different background.)</li>
                <li>Now go back to the Scripts tab, and choose the "Sprite" button under the stage to get back to the sprite's scripts.</li>
            </ol>
            <br /><em>Import your blocks</em>
            <ol start="6">

            <div><span>Gamal:</span> When we click, we should probably also give the user some visible feedback that the click has been processed.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> What do you mean?</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> Well, the user is going to be following the outline of a shape, and clicking at turning points.  That may take a while, and users get nervous if the computer doesn't seem to be paying attention.  So I thought we should mark each  point  the user clicks, a little circle or something.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> I have an idea!  There's a <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/stamp.png" alt="stamp block (in Pen)"> block that paints a picture of the sprite itself on the stage. That arrowhead thingy will point right at the point where the user clicked.</div>

                        <li>In the first script, variable <var>point list</var> should be given an appropriate initial value.</li>
                        <li>In the second script, you need a way to tell the sprite to stop following the mouse.  Replace the <code>forever</code> block with one that will loop only until the user presses the space key.</li>
                        <li>In the third script, the <code>stamp</code> block is already in place, but you have to write the code that will add the mouse's position to the list of points. Use the data abstraction for points.</li>

                    This is a good quick-and-dirty solution to the problem of entering a bunch of points into a list interactively.  But it has a couple of weaknesses:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Even after you tell the sprite to stop following the mouse, the "when I am clicked" script is still ready to run, and so if you click directly on the sprite, it will still add points to the list that you may not want.</li>
                        <li>The list of points is always kept in the same global variable.  So it's messy to create lists for several different letters.</li>
                    </ul>
                    For an alternative approach to this problem, with more complicated code but without those weaknesses, <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/5-click-points.html">click here</a>.
