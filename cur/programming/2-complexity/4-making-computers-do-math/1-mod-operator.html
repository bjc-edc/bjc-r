                <p>Katherine Johnson (1918&ndash;2020) was an African-American aerospace technologist with a Ph.D. in mathematics who worked for NASA calculating the motion of spacecraft. Johnson, originally hired as a human computer, verified the calculations of digital computers, helped calculate the trajectory of Apollo 11 (the first time humans walked on the Moon), worked on plans for a mission to Mars, and encouraged students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</p>

        <div class="takeNote">The <code>mod</code> block <strong>reports the remainder</strong> when the first input is divided by the second. For example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/17-mod-5.png" alt="(17) mod (5)" title="(17) mod (5)" /> reports 2 because when 17 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2. When one number divides another evenly, the remainder is 0. So for example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/15-mod-5.png" alt="(15) mod (5)" title="(15) mod (5)" /> reports 0.</div>

                <strong>The <code>mod</code> operator:</strong> The expression <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/17-mod-5.png" alt="(17) mod (5)" title="(17) mod (5)" /> would be written as <pre class="inline">17 MOD 5</pre> on the exam. If you see an expression with variables as input to <code>mod</code>, such as <pre class="inline">a MOD b</pre>, you can assume that <var>a</var> is zero or positive, and <var>b</var> is strictly positive (because you can't divide by 0).

            <div class="comment">AAP-2.B.5, AAP-2.C.1, AAP-2.C.2, AAP-2.C.3, AAP-2.C.4</div>
            <div class="pseudop">On the exam, you may see these four arithmetic operators: <pre class="inline">+</pre>,  <pre class="inline">-</pre>,  <pre class="inline">*</pre>, <pre class="inline">/</pre> (plus, minus, times, divide) as well as <pre class="inline">MOD</pre>. Arithmetic operators are part of most programming languages.  (Most text languages use <pre class="inline">*</pre> rather than <pre class="inline">&times;</pre> for multiplication because <pre class="inline">&times</pre> isn't on most keyboards, and because it looks too much like the letter x.)</div>
            <div class="comment">AAP-2.L.2</div>
            <div class="pseudop"><strong>Order of operations:</strong> In a block language, the nesting of blocks determines the order of operations.  For example, in <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/3-times(5+4).png" alt="3 × (5 + 4)" title="3 × (5 + 4)" /> you can <em>see</em> that the <code>+</code> block is an input to the <code>&times;</code> block, so the expression means 3&times;(5+4). Similarly, <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/(3-times-5)+4.png" alt="(3 × 5) + 4" title="(3 × 5) + 4" />  means (3&times;5)+4. In Snap<em>!</em>, it's as if there are parentheses around <em>every</em> operation.  But in text languages, you can write <pre class="inline">3 * 4 + 5</pre> 
            without parentheses, so they need the rules you learn in math class (multiplication before addition, and so on). The <code>mod</code> operator is like multiplication and division; it happens <em>before</em> addition and subtraction. So for example, <pre class="inline">7 + 5 MOD 2 - 6</pre> means <pre class="inline">7 + 1 - 6</pre>, which is, of course, 2.</div>
