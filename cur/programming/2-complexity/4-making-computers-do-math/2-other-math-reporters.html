            The <strong>triangular number</strong> function <em>adds</em> all of the whole numbers from 1 through the input number. So <code>triangular number (</code><var>n</var><code>)</code> reports <span class="katex">1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + (n - 1) + n</span>.<br />

        <p>
            The <strong>factorial</strong> function <em>multiplies</em> all of the whole numbers from 1 through the input number. In other words, <code>(</code><var>n</var><code>) !</code> reports <span class="katex">1 \times 2 \times 3 \times ... \times (n - 1) \times n</span>.<br />

            To develop these procedures, you will use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/numbers-from-to.png" alt="numbers from () to ()" title="numbers from () to ()" />to get a list of the numbers to add or multiple and use the <code>combine</code> block to add or multiply them all together. The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/combine.png" alt="combine with() items of ()" title="combine with() items of ()" /> block takes an operation and a list as input and reports the result of combining all the elements in the input list using the input operation. For example, the expression below reports: <span class="katex">0 + 1 + 2</span>.<br />

            <p>All of these approaches work, but the code using recursion is shorter and simpler to look at than the iterative version; programmers would call it "more elegant." And your version using the higher order function <code>combine</code> is the most elegant.</p>
            <!--<p><code>Combine</code> is an abstraction that is implemented one of those two ways, but you don't need to know which way in order to use it.</p>
            <p>By embodying the pattern of these exmaples in an HOF, we let you think about the kind of problem you are solving (a combining problem) rather than which algorithm to use.</p>
            <p>The iterative way and the recursive away are two ways of implementing...</p>
            <p>The HOF <code>map</code> encapsulates a class o problems in which we have a list of values and we need some function of each of those values, The HOF Keep encp a different pattern, in which we . COMBINE is a other kidn of problem. tri and fac are examples of that kidn of problem. So, when we give you the HOF combine, we've done two thigs: we've identified a class of problems and we've implemented a soltuion. The identification is the interestding part.-->

                                In order to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers you will need to find:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The <em>divisors of each</em> input number</li>
                                    <li>The numbers that are <em>divisors of both</em> input numbers </li>
                                    <li>The <em>greatest</em> number that is a divisor of both input numbers</li>
                                </ol>

Maybe that's an optional project after this page is in the main text. Does anyone remember why that got cut? --MF, 9/27/18<br />
		I like the entire "older? version" page (which I think is actually newer).  The triangle stuff, the tone of talking to kids as if they were people, all of it.  Let's bring it back here. -bh
