        <div class="learn"><strong>In this project</strong>, you will create a <em>library</em> (a collection) of math tools that builds on the blocks you created in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/2-combining-predicates.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Lab 3 Page 2: Combining Predicates">Lab 3 Page 2: Combining Predicates</a>.</div>

            <p>A <strong>software library</strong> is a collection of procedures that can be used in  programs.</p>

        <p>Using <em>libraries</em> simplifies the development of new programs. When you use procedures that you already know work correctly, you reduce the amount of time you need to spend coding, the number of possible bugs your code can have, and how much of your project you need to test.</p>
