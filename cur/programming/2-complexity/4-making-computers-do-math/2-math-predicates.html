		<h2>Making a Mathematical Library</h2>
        <div class="learn"><strong>In this project</strong>, you will create a <em>library</em> (a collection) of math tools that builds on the blocks you created in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/2-combining-predicates.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Lab 3 Page 2: Combining Predicates">Lab 3 Page 2: Combining Predicates</a>.</div>

            <p>A <strong>software library</strong> is a collection of procedures that can be used in  programs.</p>

        <p>Using <em>libraries</em> simplifies the development of new programs. When you use procedures that you already know work correctly, you reduce the amount of time you need to spend coding, the number of possible bugs your code can have, and how much of your project you need to test.</p>

        <p>You've now made a small library, and you might want to write a list of instructions for how to use the functions in your library (for example, <code>divisors of</code> takes a positive integer as input and reports a list of numbers). The instructions form an <em>Application Program Interface</em> for the library.</p>

            <div class="ap-standard">AAP-3.D.4, AAP-3.D.5</div>
            <p>An <strong>application program interface (API)</strong> documents what a programmer needs to know about using a library: it's a description of each procedure's purpose, inputs, and outputs (but not its algorithms).</p>

                    <p>A common kind of API is a <em>web API</em> in which the library exists on someone else's computer. For example, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/start" title="Google Maps API" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a> describes how to embed a Google Map on your own website.</p>

                    <p>A web API is just a call to a procedure on another machine. For example, these are three different notations for the same procedure call, which looks up the number of searches for "BJC" in the US:

                        </ul>
                    The only difference is that the URL shows where on the Internet to find the procedure.</p>
