        <p>
            Nested functions (that is, functions used inside of other functions, like the way you used <code>divisible?</code> and <code>numbers</code> inside of <code>keep</code>) can be hard to read. Snap<em>!</em> offers another way to write code with multiple functions. You can use the <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pipe.png" alt="pipe () → ()" title="pipe () → ()" /> function from the "Frequency Distribution Analysis" library to write your code one function at at time.
            <div class="comment">image needs alt/title tags --MF, 6/11/19</div><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/divisors-with-pipe.png" /><br />
            The <code>pipe</code> function sends the <var>input number</var> data through <code>numbers (1) of ()</code> to report a list of numbers and then that list goes through <code>keep items such that ((input number) divisible by ()?) from ()</code> to get the numbers from that list that are divisible by the input number.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that the empty input slots in each function are filled by the output of the previous function (or filled by the starting data in the case of the first function): 
            <ul>
                <li>The empty slot in the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/numbers-from-to.png" alt="numbers from () to ()" title="numbers from () to ()" /> function is filled by <var>input number</var>.</li>
                <li>The empty list input slot (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/list-input-slot.png" alt="list input slot (small white square with two small, orange, horizontal rectangles inside)" title="list input slot (small white square with two small, orange, horizontal rectangles inside)" />) in <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/keep-for-pipe.png" alt="keep items such that ((input number) divisible by ()?) from ()" title="keep items such that ((input number) divisible by ()?) from ()" /> is filled by the output of <code>numbers</code>.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>As usual, the blank input slot in the predicate for <code>keep</code> (that is, in <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/divisible-for-pipe.png" alt="(input number) divisible by ()?" title="(input number) divisible by ()?" />) is filled by each item of <code>keep</code>'s input list (here, the output of <code>numbers</code>) so that <code>keep</code> can decide whether each number will be kept.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            It's like a pipe of made of pieces connected together; the <var>input number</var> goes in one end and works through each function, producing a new output at each step.
        </p>
    
    
        <div class="endnote"><code>Pipe</code> is a <em>higher order function</em>; it is a function that takes functions as input. You've seen a higher order functions already: <code>keep</code> (in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/2-keeping-list-items.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Keeping Items from a List">Unit 2 Lab 3</a>).</div>

				<li>Choose "Libraries..." in the Snap<em>!</em> file menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button" title="File button"/>), and select and import the "Frequency Distribution Analysis" library.</li>
                <li>Rebuild your <code>number of divisors</code> block using the <code>pipe</code> function.
                <div class="endnote">You can either create a new function called something like <code>number of divisors 2 </code> or <code>pipe version of number of divisors</code>, or you can rewrite the same block and just drag off the original report instruction but leave it inside the <code>number of divisors</code> block unattached from the hat block so will be saved in there but it won't run.</div>
                </li>
			</ol>
		</div>
        <p>You don't ever have to use <code>pipe</code> again, but if you find it hard to write a function with a bunch of nested reporters, you can always import <code>pipe</code> again.</p>
