		<h2>More Mathematical Reporters</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <strong>In this project</strong>, you will create mathematical blocks that combine several numbers, such as a <code>sum</code> block, which combines two numbers using addition: <br />

        </div>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
				<li>Open your U2L4-MathLibrary project if it isn't open already.</li>
                <li>
                    Build blocks for <code>maximum</code> (reporting the larger of two input numbers) and <code>minimum</code> (reporting the smaller of two input numbers):<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/max-of-6-and-4-reporting.png" alt="max of (6) and (4) reporting 6" title="max of (6) and (4) reporting 6" />

        <p> The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/combine.png" alt="combine 'list input slot' using 'reporter input slot'" title="combine 'list input slot' using 'reporter input slot'" /> block takes two inputs: a list and an operation <em>with two inputs</em>, and it reports the result of combining all the elements in the input list using the input operation. For example, the expression below reports: 0 + 1 + 2.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine-simple-example.png" alt="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3" title="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3" />
        </p>

        <div class="takeNote">
            <p><strong>You choose the operation, and <code>combine</code> performs that operation by <em>combining</em> all the items in the input list and then reports the result.</strong></p>
            <p>Notice that the function used to <em>combine</em> the list items always has two blank input slots. The <code>keep</code> block only needs one blank in its input function, but with <code>combine</code>, two are required.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p><code>Combine</code> is a <em>higher-order function</em>; it is a function that takes a function as input. You've seen another higher-order function already: <code>keep</code> (in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/5-keeping-list-items.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Keeping Items from a List">Unit 2 Lab 3</a>).</p>
            <p>
                Unlike <code>keep</code>, the <code>combine</code> function is only used with a few input functions.

                        and the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/maximum.png" alt="maximum of () ()" title="maximum of () ()" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/minimum.png" alt="minimum of () ()" title="minimum of () ()" /> blocks you've just written yourself.

                            The function has to be <em>associative</em>, meaning that it can't matter what order you group the items in. For example, addition is associative: (7&thinsp;+&thinsp;8)&thinsp;+&thinsp;1 is the same as 7&thinsp;+&thinsp;(8&thinsp;+&thinsp;1) (work it out yourself), but subtraction is not: (7&thinsp;−&thinsp;8)&thinsp;−&thinsp;1 is different from 7&thinsp;−&thinsp;(8&thinsp;−&thinsp;1).
                            So expressions like <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine-minus.png" alt="combine with (-) items of (list 7 8 1)"> would be ambiguous.
