            <h3 class="box-head">Debugging Dependencies</h3>
            <p>Sometimes when you take a script out of the program where you built it and try to use it somewhere else, something breaks. It could be that the script depends on a custom block that isn't defined in the new program, or it could be (as in this case) that the script depends on a <em>global variable</em> that isn't defined in the new program. </p>
            <p>To fix this problem so you can use the imported block, you'll need to define the global variable in your new program. Dependencies are one reason to use script variables rather than global variables whenever you can. Because they are defined <em>in</em> their scripts, you don't lose them when you move the script to a new place.</p>

                    <p>If <var>player list</var> is initialized every time the game starts again, the game won't be able to remember any names. So, you will need to use a different event to start the game than to initialize <var>player list</var>. For example, you could use the green flag to initialize the list and use the space bar to begin the Number Guessing game.</p>

Something like a polygon block seems simpler and more natural to export.
