                            When you are debugging your code, it can help to see the value of a variable at different points in your program. There are several ways to do this:
                            <ul>
                                <li>You can <strong>click the variable block</strong> (like <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/answer.png" alt="the answer block" title="the answer block" />) occasionally to report it's current value.</li>
                                <li>If it's a global variable, you can <strong>mark the check-box</strong> beside it in the palette (<img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/answer-checked.png" alt="answer block with check-box checked" title="answer block with check-box checked" />) to have a <em>watcher</em> display on the stage (as shown in the animation below).</li>
                                <li>If it's a local (script) variable, you can <strong>use the <code>show variable</code> block</strong> to display a  watcher on the stage (and use <code>hide variable</code> to hide it again). (This is also shown in the following animation.)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <div class="todo">
                        <p>Two thoughts on this animation: 1) It's wide. Can we make it narrower by stacking the <code>Number guessing game</code> block above the block editor and narrowing the browser window? 2) The animation has a lot going on that needs to be watched and interpreted. I think it would help to lose the first few frames where it shows "you guessed it" and to make the first and last frames last longer (1-2 sec) so viewers have a chance to see what happens at the end and to get their bearings before it starts again. --MF, 3/21/18</p>

                        	<p>At first, I wondered if this might be something that should  be included in the debugging tip, but then I realized that I'm not sure what it means. Can someone who understands the intended meaning please look at this and explain it to me so we can work to clarify it? --MF, 3/21/18</p>

                <li>Find a way to vary the language a bit so that your program does not always repeat exactly the same words in the same situation. For example, if a player guesses too high twice in a row, the program could say "That's still too big. Try another number."</li>
