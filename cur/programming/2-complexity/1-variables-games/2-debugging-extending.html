    	<h2>Debugging and Extending Your Number Guessing Game</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will debug a Number Guessing game script, and you will make the computer tell the player whether their guess is too big or too small.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
                <li>
<strong>Analyze and Debug.</strong> Consider this definition for a <code>Number guessing game</code> block. Using this code, if you keep playing over and over, the computer will <em>sometimes</em> (not often) congratulate you for guessing the number <em>before you even guess</em>. This is a <strong>bug</strong>&mdash;an error in the code that makes the program behave differently than expected.<br />

Analyze the code and explain how this could ever happen.<br /></li>
                        
                    </ul>
				</li>
            	<li>If it isn't open already, open your U2L1-NumberGuessing project.</li>
				<li>
                    Create a second script variable called <var>guess</var> to store and check the answer. (Be sure to initialize it at the beginning of the game to some value that can't provoke this bug.)
                    <div class="endnote">
                        Use the right-pointing triangle to add more script variables. (The left triangle will remove them.)<br />

                </li>
                <li><strong>Test and debug</strong> your code.</li>

        <h3>Extending the Program with More Specific Responses</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="5">
                <li>Use more conditional blocks and predicates to make the computer tell the player whether their guess is too big or too small: "That's too big. Try again." <br /><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Where in the code should these conditionals go?</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Test and debug.</strong> Play your game a few more times, and check that it works the way you expect:
                    <ul>
                    <li>The game should ask the player to guess its secret number.</li>
                        <li>The game should say whether each wrong answer was too big or too small, or congratulate the player on a correct answer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>Since script variables  exist only while the script is running, the <var>secret number</var> variable will <em>not exist</em> after <code>Number guessing game</code> finishes running. When the game is played again, the program will create a new <var>secret number</var> variable and <em>initialize</em> it with a different random number.</p>
		<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />
        <p>Later in the course, you will teach the computer how to guess a secret number that <em>you</em> have chosen.</p>
        
        <div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="7">
				<li>Right now, the script always picks a number between 1 and 10.  At the start of the game, ask the player what the maximum number should be, and make your program choose a number between 1 and <var>maximum</var>.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeItFurther"><a name="further" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
            <ol type="A">
				<li>Use another script variable to keep track of how many guesses the player makes before getting the right number. When the player guesses the secret number, say how many guesses it took.</li>
                <li>Find a way to vary the language a bit so that your program does not always repeat exactly the same words in the same situation. For example, if a player guesses too high twice in a row, the program could say "That's still too big. Try another number."</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
