		<h2>Keeping a Programming Journal</h2>
		<div class="learn"><strong>On this page,</strong> you will begin using a journal to keep track of your programming insights.</div>
		<p>
			You can use a journal to <em>learn from your own programming</em>. Here are some ways to use your journal:
			<ul>
    			<li>
					<strong>When you find a bug</strong> in your program, write down:
					<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    					<li>The symptom&ndash;How did you know there was a bug?</li>
						<li>How you found the underlying problem&ndash;What steps did you take to find figure out what was going on?</li>
						<li>The underlying problem&nbsp;What <em>was</em> going on?</li>
						<li>How you fixed it&nbsp;Try to record anything that might be helpful next time you encounter a bug like this, or better yet, to help you avoid having a bug like this in the future.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>When something inspires you</strong> to create a program your own, write down your idea for later.</li>
				<li>
					<div class="sidenote">This is just like recording bugs except that itâ€™s a bug in your understanding rather than a bug in your code.</div>
					<strong>When your expectations turn out to be wrong</strong>, write down:
					<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
						<li>What you thought would happen</li>
						<li>What actually happened</li>
						<li>Why you thought what you thought</li>
						<li>What the right thinking is</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>When you make a beautiful program</strong>&mdash;one that draws a beautiful picture or even just a  beautiful piece of code&mdash;print it out and add it to your journal.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/write-in-journal.png" alt="Write In Your Journal" title="Write In Your Journal" /> Are there any bugs you've run into so far? Any cool project ideas? Any projects you've been proud of?</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
