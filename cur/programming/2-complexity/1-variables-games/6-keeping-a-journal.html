		<h2>Keeping a Programming Journal</h2>
		<div class="learn"><strong>On this page,</strong> you will begin using a journal to keep track of your programming insights.</div>
		<p>
			You can use a journal to <em>learn from your own programming</em>.
			The journal is just a notebook in which you write notes to yourself,
			like a diary.  It's <em>for you,</em> not for your teacher.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here are some ways to use your journal:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>When you learn a new idea</strong> (not just the
					name of a Snap<em>!</em> block), make a note of it.
				</li>
				<li><strong>When you make or discover a beautiful program</strong>&mdash;a  beautiful piece of code, or one that draws a beautiful picture&mdash;print it out, or take a photo, and add it to your journal.</li>
    			<li>
					<strong>When you find a bug</strong> in your program, write down:
					<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    					<li>The symptom&mdash;How did you know there was a bug?</li>
						<li>How you found the underlying problem&mdash;What steps did you take to find figure out what was going on?</li>
						<li>The underlying problem&mdash;What <em>was</em> going on?</li>
						<li>How you fixed it&mdash;Record anything that might be helpful next time you encounter a bug like this, or to help you avoid having a bug like this in the future.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>When something inspires you</strong> to create a related program on your own, write down your idea for later.</li>
				<li>
					<div class="sidenote">This is just like recording bugs except that itâ€™s a bug in your understanding rather than a bug in your code.</div>
					<strong>When you're asked to predict what some script will do, and</strong> your expectations turn out to be wrong, write down:
					<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
						<li>What you thought would happen</li>
						<li>What actually happened</li>
						<li>Why you thought what you thought</li>
						<li>How you think about it now</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>When the curriculum asks you to write</strong>
					your ideas about something, write in your journal.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

			</ol>
