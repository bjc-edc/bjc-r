		<h2>Keeping Score with Global Variables</h2>		
		<div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will use a <em>global variable</em> to keep score in your Click Alonzo game.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>In your Number Guessing Game, you used <em>script variables</em> to store information (the value of <var>secret number</var>) that only one script needed. To keep score in Click Alonzo, more than one script will need access to that information, so you'll use a <em>global variable</em>.</p>
        <div class="endnote">If multiple scripts need access to a variable, or if the information in that variable needs to be saved with your file, you'll use a global variable. Otherwise use script variables.</div>

            <p>The orange oval blocks that name variables are reporters, like other oval blocks.  But <em>most</em> reporters implement <em>functions,</em> which means that when you call the same block with the same inputs, you always get the same value. <code>2+3</code> is always 5. The <code>random</code> block, and reporters you write using <code>random</code>, are different; calling them twice with the same inputs may report different answers.</p>
            <p>Variable blocks are one step further away from functions; a program can choose to change the value that a variable block will report by using <code>set</code> or <code>change</code> to give the variable a new value.</p>

            <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/change-score-by-1.png" alt="change score by 1"><br />
      <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/score-variable-reporting-8.png" alt="score reporting 8">      
            <p> It turns out that any program that changes the values of variables can be rewritten in a way that doesn't <code>set</code> or otherwise change the values of variables. There are advantages to this <em>functional programming</em> style, which avoids certain kinds of otherwise-common bugs, but some kinds of programs are hard to write functionally. You aren't really ready to think about this yet, but we'll come back to functional programming later in the year.</p>
