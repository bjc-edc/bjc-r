            <p>PG: I agree with the notes from Al and Mary. We seem to have front-loaded technical stuff some of which isn't even needed (or can be buried as clickable background) and all of which should come after some relevant experience. Stuff that /is/ needed can be less didactically spelled out. We are telling kids exactly what finger-strokes to make (create a command block, inside create a script variable) before saying what they are trying to make or how it should eventually work. First say what the game /is/. Then "You will need a way to store the secret number, a way to let the player make repeated guesses, and a way to check whether the guesses are correct." /Then/ people have at least a clue about what they might look for. Since we don't (Brian, can you please put on some pressure?) have a rainbow palette, we are stuck telling them the name of every block they'll need but at least they'll have a clue about why and some clue about what to do with them. And the lab title is odd.  We're learning (some) about Using Variables, but we're not, at least at the start, /improving/ games we've already made.</p>
            <p>BH: This is where we straighten out all the different kinds of variables.</p>
            <p>MF: need to discuss Al's suggestions</p>

                <strong>In this lab,</strong> you will use local and global <em>variables</em> to store information.

                    Inside this  block, create a script variable called <var>secret number</var> (instructions below), and set it to a random number between 1 and 10.

                <p>In algebra, a variable is sometimes used for something whose value you don't know yet and the goal is to find out its value. In programming <em>you decide</em> the values of variables.</p>
            </div>
            <p>A <strong>variable</strong> is an abstraction in a program that can hold a value.</p>
        </div>
        
		<p>
        	Inputs and <code>for</code> counters are kinds of <strong>local variables</strong>; they work only within the script in which they're created. If you drag one into a different script, it won't work. Sometimes you need variables to hold other kinds of information temporarily while your script is running. That's what the <code>script variables</code> block is for.<br />
        </p>
        <p>In a number-guessing game, the player tries to guess the computer's secret number. The computer needs to store the secret number so that it can compare it to the player's guesses, but once the game is over, the secret number is no longer needed. If you play the game again, you want  a new secret number.</p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Local Variable</strong>
			<p>A <strong>local variable</strong> can be set or used only in the environment in which it is defined. This term includes inputs to procedures and variables created by the <code>for</code> or <code>script variables</code> block.</p>
