		<h2>Using Local Variables to Develop a Number Guessing Game </h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p>
                <strong>In this lab,</strong> you will use two kinds of variables to store information:
<ul>
                    <li><em>Script variables</em> (a kind of <em>local</em> variable) that can be used only within a single script, and</li>
                    <li><em>Global variables</em> that can be set, used, or changed anywhere in the program.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop a number guessing game that uses a script variable to keep track of a secret number.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Using a Script Variable</h3>
        You have created variables as inputs to blocks that you made:<br />
        <p> <div class="sidenoteBig">On the AP CSP Exam, you will see a kind of code that appears there and nowhere else. In that code, the <code>pinwheel</code> script might look like this:
              <pre>PROCEDURE pinwheel (numberOfBranches)
{
    REPEAT numberOfBranches TIMES
    {
        MOVE_FORWARD (100)
        WAIT (.1)
        MOVE_FORWARD (-70)
        WAIT (.1)
        ROTATE_RIGHT (360 / numberOfBranches)
	}
}</pre></div>
<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Blockswith-Inputs_img/numberofbranches.png" alt="pinwheel code after replacement" title="pinwheel code after replacement" />
        </p>
        <p>
            You have also used variables that the <code>for</code> block gave you:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/squirral-script.png" alt="squiral script" title="squiral script" />
		</p>
		<p>
  Input variables and <code>for</code> variables are kinds of <strong>local variables</strong>; they work  only within the script in which they're created. If you  drag one into a different script, it won't work.   Sometimes you  need to create <em>more</em>  variables to hold information temporarily while your script is running. The <code>script variables</code> block lets you do that.<br />

        </p>
	<p>For example, imagine a number-guessing game in which the player tries to guess the computer's secret number. The computer needs to store the secret number so that it can compare the player's guesses to it, but once the game is over, the secret number is no longer needed. If you play the game again, you want  a new secret number.</p>
    <div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Local variable</strong>
                    <p>A variable that  can be set or used only in the environment in which it is defined. This is the usual computer science term for variables that are defined as inputs to procedures or (in Snap<em>!</em> and some other languages) created by <code>for</code> or <code>script variables</code>.</p>

                <li>Create a new command block called <code>Number guessing game</code>.</li>
                <li>
                    Inside this  block, create a script variable called <var>secret number</var> (instructions below), and set it to a random number between 1 and 10.

                                <strong>Move a <code>script variables</code> block into the Scripting Area.</strong> You can find it in the Variables palette.<br />

                        </ol>
                        <strong>Later, you will use the script variable</strong> by dragging it out of the <code>script variables</code> block, the way you drag an input variable, and placing it where you need it in your code.

        <h3>Checking the Player's Guess</h3>
		<p>To make the computer ask the player to guess again and again until they get it right, you will use the <code>repeat until</code> block. <code>Repeat until</code> is a <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/6-the-for-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">loop</a> (just like <code>repeat</code>, <code>forever</code>, and <code>for</code>) that<strong> repeats until a certain <em>condition</em> is met</strong>. In this case, the code should repeat until the player's answer equals the secret number.</p>
        
		<div class="takeNote">
        	<div class="vocab"><strong>: Boolean</strong><br />The word Boolean is capitalized because it's named after a person, George Boole, who invented the branch of mathematics dealing with Boolean operations (such as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>).</div>
        	<p><code>Repeat until</code> is a <em>conditional</em> block (like <code>if</code>). Conditionals make choices based on a <strong>condition</strong> in the form of a <strong>Boolean value</strong> (either <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true" title="true" /> or <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false" title="false" />). <!--DEV NOTE: don't tell them what they shouldn't do (they may not have even thought of that and now we are giving hem the idea); tell them what they should do. :) --MF Cut text: But you don't generally use these values directly in your code; you don't say <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/iftrue.png" height="50" alt="if (true) ...">. Instead, --> The condition is checked by a <em>predicate</em>, a true/false question such as <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/a-gt-7.png" alt="a &gt; 7">. Predicates always report Boolean values.
