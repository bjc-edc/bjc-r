            <h3>Ruthless Suggestions from Al</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Radical suggestion: Unless AP demands it, there’s no need for script variables in a first course like this. The guessing game can be done with helper functions. But if we need to keep it,
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        	“In this lab, you will use two kinds of variables to store information:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Script variables (a kind of local variable) that can be used only within a single script, and</li>
                                <li>Global variables that can be set, used, or changed anywhere in the program.”</li>
                            </ul>
                            Have they met the word “variable” before? And, even if so, this tells me nothing. Why not say that [← “variable” shows up in 1.3.3, but I suggest changing it there to “input.”] a script variable is a kind of watermelon variable (italics don’t help). I’d cut everything up to the FYTD.
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I agree with the principle and sentiment, but not all quite of the suggestion. There is a lot of pre-teaching here. Without looking super closely, I suggest moving and integrating the sub-bullets of the pink box into vocab boxes, and I wonder about moving the white text and vocab at the top (the formality) after the experience of the FYTD and maybe trimming it up. Needs some careful attention. --MF, 5/16/18</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>delete “who invented the branch of mathematics dealing with Boolean operations (such as and, or, and not)” [← “Gauss was a mathematician who invented Gaussian integers.”] </li>

                            <li>I don't dislike is <em>that</em> much, but it should be yellow not grey if it stays. Having it there is more about the capitalization, but I guess it's not really needed... --MF, 5/16/18</li>

                <strong>In this lab,</strong> you will use two kinds of variables to store information:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Script variables</em> (a kind of <em>local</em> variable) that can be used only within a single script, and</li>
                    <li><em>Global variables</em> that can be set, used, or changed anywhere in the program.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop a number guessing game that uses a script variable to keep track of a secret number.</p>

        <h3>Using a Script Variable (a Local Variable)</h3>
        <p>
        	You have created variables as inputs to blocks that you made:<br />
            <!--<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/input-variable-for-pinwheelbranches.png" alt="input-variable-for-pinwheelbranches">-->
            <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/input-variable-for-pinwheelbranches-commented.png" alt="block definition for pinwheel and setting 'number of branches' input variable for pinwheel" title="block definition for pinwheel and setting 'number of branches' input variable for pinwheel" />
        </p>
        <p>
            You have also used the variable that the <code>for</code> block gave you:<br />
            <!--<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/local-variable-created-by-for-block.png" alt="local-variable-created-by-for-block">-->
            <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/local-variable-created-by-for-block-commented.png" alt="local variable created by for block" title="local variable created by for block" />
        </p>
		<p>
        	Input variables and <code>for</code> variables are kinds of <strong>local variables</strong>; they work  only within the script in which they're created. If you drag one into a different script, it won't work. Sometimes you need to create <em>more</em> variables to hold information temporarily while your script is running. The <code>script variables</code> block lets you do that.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/scriptvar.png" alt="script variables" title="script variables" />
        </p>
        <p>For example, imagine a number-guessing game in which the player tries to guess the computer's secret number. The computer needs to store the secret number so that it can compare the player's guesses to it, but once the game is over, the secret number is no longer needed. If you play the game again, you want  a new secret number.</p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Local Variable</strong>
			<p>A <strong>local variable</strong> that  can be set or used only in the environment in which it is defined. This is the usual computer science term for variables that are defined as inputs to procedures or created by the <code>for</code> or <code>script variables</code> block.</p>

                <li>Create a new command block called <code>Number guessing game</code>.</li>
                <li>
                    Inside this  block, create a script variable called <var>secret number</var> (instructions below), and set it to a random number between 1 and 10.

                        </ol>
                        <strong>Later, you will use the script variable</strong> by dragging it out of the <code>script variables</code> block, the way you drag an input variable, and placing it where you need it in your code.

        <h3>Checking the Player's Guess</h3>
        <div class="sidenote">You learned about loops in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/6-the-for-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Looping with a Counter">Unit 1, Looping with a Counter</a>.</div>
        <p>You'll want the computer to ask  players to guess again and again until they get it right. To do that, you will use the <code>repeat until</code> block. <code>Repeat until</code> is a <em>loop</em> (just like <code>repeat</code>, <code>forever</code>, and <code>for</code>) that<strong> repeats until a certain <em>condition</em> is met</strong>. In this case, the code should repeat until the player's answer equals the secret number.</p>
        
        <div class="takeNote">
        	<p><code>Repeat until</code> is a <em>conditional</em> block (like <code>if</code>). Conditionals make choices based on a <strong>condition</strong> in the form of a <strong>Boolean value</strong> (either <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true" title="true" /> or <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false" title="false" />). <!--DEV NOTE: don't tell them what they shouldn't do (they may not have even thought of that and now we are giving hem the idea); tell them what they should do. :) --MF Cut text: But you don't generally use these values directly in your code; you don't say <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/iftrue.png" height="50" alt="if (true) ...">. Instead, --> The condition is checked by a <em>predicate</em>, a true/false question such as <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/a-gt-7.png" alt="a &gt; 7" title="a &gt; 7" />. Predicates always report Boolean values. And they fit into  hexagonal input slots, such as in  <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if.png" alt="if block" title="if block" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat-until.png" alt="repeat until" title="repeat until" />.

            <p>A <em>Boolean</em> value is either True or False.  The word Boolean is capitalized because it's named after a person, George Boole, who invented the branch of mathematics dealing with Boolean operations (such as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>).</p>
