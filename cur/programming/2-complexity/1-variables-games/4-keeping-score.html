    	<h2>Keeping Score with Global Variables</h2>
		<div class="learn">
          <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will use a <em>global variable</em> to keep score in your Click Alonzo game.</p>
        </div>

        <p>In your Number Guessing Game, you used <em>script variables</em> to store information (the value of <var>secret number</var>) that was needed by only one script. To keep score in Click Alonzo, more than one script will need access to that information, so you'll use a <em>global variable</em>.</p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Global Variable</strong>
            <p>A <strong>global variable</strong> is a variable that is usable by all scripts in the program.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote">
            <h3 class="box-head">When are global variables needed?</h3>
            <p>Most of the time, script variables are a better choice because they can't be changed by some other part of the program, and so they reduce the chance of bugs. But <strong>if multiple scripts need access</strong> to a variable or <strong>if the information in that variable needs to be saved</strong> with your project, then use a global variable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
				<li>Open your U1L1-ClickAlonzo project, play the game, and review the code so you remember how it works.</li>

                <div class="takeNote">If you save new work under an old filename, Snap<em>!</em> will overwrite your original project. Use  &quot;Save as...&quot; from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu to save with the new name. When you load an older project and are about to make a big change, get in the habit of <em>saving first, with the new name, before you change anything</em>. </div>

                        <p>
                            When you are debugging your code, it can help to see the value of a variable at different points in your program. This is done differently for local and global variables:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Global variables have check-boxes that control the display of the variable <em>watcher</em> on the stage (shown below).<br />
                                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/golbal-variables-checked.png"  height="300" alt="Checking the global variables in the palette." title="Checking the global variables in the palette."/><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/global-variables-displayed.png"  height="300" alt="Displaying the global variable on the stage" title="Displaying the global variable on the stage"/></li>
                                <li>If it's a <em>local</em> (script) variable, you can <strong>use the <code>show variable</code> block</strong> inside the script to display a  watcher on the stage (and use <code>hide variable</code> to hide it again).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ol>
		</div>


        <div class="ifTime">
            <ol start="9">
                <li>If the sprite moves without being clicked, make the score go down by 1.</li>
                <li>Game too hard? Increase the score by 2 for a hit.  Too big a change? Increase by 3 for a hit, decrease by 2 for a miss.  You can make arbitrarily fine adjustments.  This process is called <em>playtuning</em> a game.</li>
            </ol>
