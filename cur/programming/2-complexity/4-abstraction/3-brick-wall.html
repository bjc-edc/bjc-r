       2.2.1A The process of developing an abstraction involves removing detail and generalizing functionality. <br />
       2.2.1B An abstraction extracts common features from specific examples in order to generalize concepts. <br />
       2.2.1C An abstraction generalizes functionality with input parameters that allow software reuse.<br />
       2.2.2B Being aware of and using multiple levels of abstraction in developing programs helps to more effectively apply available resources and tools to solve problems.<br />
       5.1.2B Developing correct program components and then combining them helps in creating correct programs.<br />
       5.3.1E Parameterization can generalize a specific solution.<br />
       5.3.1F Parameters generalize a solution by allowing a function to be used instead of duplicated code.<br />
       5.3.1G Parameters provide different values as input to procedures when they are called in a program. <br />
       5.3.1L Using lists and procedures as abstractions in programming can result in programs that are easier to develop and maintain.<br />
       5.4.1C Meaningful names for variables and procedures help people better understand programs.

            <p><strong>Procedural abstraction</strong> is the process of developing a program by breaking up a large problem into smaller sub-problems.</p>
            <p>Creating a <code>draw brick</code> block lets you think in terms of a procedure with a name related to the problem you are solving. Once you've coded and debugged the block, you don't need to think about how it works each time you use it. That's the beauty of procedural abstraction.</p>

		<h3>Drawing One Brick</h3>
        <div class="sidenoteBig">Any good programming language might have many tools for drawing and moving, but it wouldn't make sense to have special tools for drawing bricks because most programs don't involve bricks. That's the sort of tool you make yourself when you need it.</div>
        <p>
            A picture of a brick is just a rectangle with a brick red color. However, there's no <code>draw rectangle</code> block in <span class="snap">snap</span>. One way to draw one is by thinking of a rectangle as a very thick line. Here's the idea:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/simpleBrickCode.png" alt="draw brick, length:(length) width:(width){set pen size to(width); move(length) steps}" title="draw brick, length:(length) width:(width){set pen size to(width); move(length) steps}"/>
        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<ol>
                <li><a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2L4-brickwall.xml"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/load-save.png" width="550" alt="Click here to load this file. Then save it to your Snap! account." title="Click here to load this file. Then save it to your Snap! account."></a><br />It includes the complete <code>draw brick</code> block shown below. Read the code; then try it out.<br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/drawBrickCode.png"  alt="draw brick, length:(length#) width:(width#){set pen color to (red); set flat line ends to (true); set pen size to (width); pen down; move(length) steps; pen up}" title="draw brick, length:(length#) width:(width#){set pen color to (red); set flat line ends to (true); set pen size to (width); pen down; move(length) steps; pen up}"/> 
				</li>
                <div class="endnote"> 
                    <p>The <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/setFlat.png"  alt="set flat line ends to &lt; &gt;" title="set flat line ends to &lt; &gt;"> block isn't built into Snap<em>!</em>. In projects without it, you can set the "Flat line ends" in the <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/settings.png" alt="Settings" title="Settings" /> menu.</p>
                    <p>Ordinarily, Snap<em>!</em> draws thick lines with rounded ends: <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/round-ends.png" alt="line with round ends" title="line with round ends">.  That's often the best choice, and you can see why below. But for bricks, we want flat line ends: <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/flat-ends.png" alt="flat line ends" title="flat line ends">.</p>
                    <p class="center"><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/flat-line-ends-why.jpg" alt="Square with flat line ends versus square with round line ends" title="Square with flat line ends versus square with round line ends" /><br /><strong>flat</strong> vs. <strong>rounded</strong> line ends</p>
                </div>            
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Using Problem Decomposition</h3>
		<p>
        	You'd like the "top level" block to be something like this:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/draw-brick-wall-7.png" alt="draw Brick Wall with (7) rows" title="draw Brick Wall with (7) rows"/><br />
            Getting there involves <strong>problem decomposition</strong>: breaking the problem into smaller pieces.
        </p>
		<p>
        	There are two kinds of rows, so we make blocks that specialize in each:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Row A</strong>: <img class="noshadow" border="0" title="Row A" alt="Row A" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/row-a.png" /></li>
                <li><strong>Row B</strong>: <img class="noshadow" border="0" title="Row B" alt="Row B" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/row-b.png" /></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="second">
        	<ol start="2">
            	<li>Use <code>draw brick</code> to make blocks <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/rowa-block.png" alt="block rowA" title="block rowA"/> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/rowb-block.png" alt="block rowB" title="block rowB"/>.</li>
            
    <div class="endnote"> 
        <a href="#hint-too-much" data-toggle="collapse" title="">Too much abstraction?</a>
        <div id="hint-too-much" class="collapse">
            <p>It's possible to go overboard on abstraction and build so many blocks that your program is just as cluttered as it would be without the custom blocks. But it <em>can</em> be useful to make a custom block even when its definition is just one built-in block. For example, to draw the cement between blocks (shown as white space), you can just use <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/move4.png" alt="Move 4 Steps">, but it might make sense to define a <code>draw cement</code> block that uses <code>move</code> inside it. </p>
            <p>Why? You might later decide that four steps is the wrong thickness for cement and you'd rather have five. Or you might want the cement to be cement-colored, slightly gray. With many <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/move4.png" alt="Move 4 Steps"> scattered through your program, you would have to find and change each one. To make matters worse, your complete project might have <code>move</code> blocks that <em>aren't</em> about cement. But with a <code>draw cement</code> block, you can change just its definition, and all the cement in your picture will be changed.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
            	<li>
                	The two kinds of rows should be exactly the same length.  Your first try at drawing Row B is probably a little too long. <strong>Debug it.</strong>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Should Row B have different-size bricks, different-size gaps, or just different-size bricks on the end?</li>
                        <li>If you're not sure, try all the possibilities and see which looks right in the finished wall.</li>
                        <li>Or think "What would <em>make the most sense</em> in a <em>real</em> brick wall?"</li>
