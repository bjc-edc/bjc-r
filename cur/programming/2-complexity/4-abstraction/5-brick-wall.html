            <h4><strong>Abstraction</strong></h4>
            <p>While any good programming language might have many tools for drawing and moving, it wouldn't make sense to have special tools for drawing bricks because most programs don't involve bricks. That is the sort of tool you make yourself when you need it.</p>
            <p>Creating a special <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/drawBrick.png" alt="drawBrick length:() width:() block" title="drawBrick length:() width:() block"/> block lets you use procedure names related to the problem you are solving (like <code>draw brick</code>), rather than the general-purpose procedures  (like <code>move</code>) that the computer uses for all kinds of tasks. <!--The process of moving from what the programming language gives you to a natural language (one that humans speak) is a key part of good abstraction.--></p>

		<h3>Drawing One Brick</h3>
        <p>
            A picture of a brick is just a rectangle with a brick red color. However, there's no <code>draw rectangle</code> block in <span class="snap">snap</span>. One way to draw one is by thinking of a rectangle as a very thick line. Here's the idea:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/simpleBrickCode.png" alt="draw rectangle, length:() width:() block definition" title="draw rectangle, length:() width:() block definition"/>
        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
				<div class="sidenoteBig"> 
                    <p>The <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/setFlat.png"  alt="set flat line ends to &lt; &gt;"> block isn't built into Snap<em>!</em>. In projects without it, you can set the "Flat line ends" in the <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/settings.png" alt="Settings" title="Settings" /> menu.</p>
                    <p>Ordinarily, Snap<em>!</em> draws thick lines with rounded ends: <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/round-ends.png" alt="line with round ends">.  That's often the best choice, and you can see why below. But for bricks, we want flat line ends: <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/flat-ends.png" alt="flat line ends">.</p>
                    <p class="center"><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/flat-line-ends-why.jpg" alt="" title="" /><br /><strong>flat</strong> vs. <strong>rounded</strong> line ends</p>
                </div>
        	<ol>
                <li>
                    Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2L4-brickwall.xml">this starter project</a>.  It includes the complete <code>draw brick</code> block shown below. Read the code; then try it out.<br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/drawBrickCode.png"  alt="draw brick, length:() width:() block definition" title="draw brick, length:() width:() block definition"/> 
				</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Using Problem Decomposition</h3>
		<p>
        	You'd like the "top level" block to be something like this:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/draw-brick-wall-7.png" alt="draw-brick-wall-7" /><br />
            Getting there involves <strong>problem decomposition</strong>: breaking the problem into smaller pieces.
        </p>
		<p>
        	There are two kinds of rows, so we make blocks that specialize in each:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Row A</strong>: <img class="noshadow" border="0" title="Row A" alt="Row A" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/row-a.png" /></li>
                <li><strong>Row B</strong>: <img class="noshadow" border="0" title="Row B" alt="Row B" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/row-b.png" /></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="second">
        	<ol start="2">
            	<li>Use <code>draw brick</code> to make blocks <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/rowa-block.png" alt="Row A" /> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/rowb-block.png" alt="Row B" />.</li>
            	<!--<li>Think about what helper blocks besides <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick.png" alt="Draw Brick" /> you might want.</li>-->
            
        <!--<div class="takeNote"> 
          <p><strong>Too much abstraction? </strong>It's possible to go overboard on abstraction and build so many blocks that your program is just as cluttered as it would be without the special blocks. </p>
          <p>But it can also be useful to make a special block even when its definition is just one built-in block. For example, to draw the mortar (the cement between bricks, shown  as white space), you can just use <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/move4.png" alt="Move 4 Steps">, but it might make sense to define a <code>draw mortar</code> block. </p>
          <p>Why? You might later decide that 4 steps is the wrong thickness for mortar, and you'd rather have 5. Or you might want the mortar to be  cement-colored, slightly gray. And your complete project might have <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/move4.png" alt="Move 4 Steps"> blocks that <em>aren't</em> about mortar. With many <code>move</code> blocks scattered through your program, you would have to find and change each one, and keep putting in <code>set pen color</code> blocks. With a <code>draw mortar</code> block, you can just change its definition, and all the mortar in your picture will be changed.</p>
        </div>-->
            	<li>
                    <!--Mortar is not a word we need studetns to learn. Using "gap" instead. --MF <div class="sidenote">Mortar is a kind of cement that bricklayers use to hold the bricks together.</div>-->
                	The two kinds of rows should be exactly the same length.  Your first try at drawing Row B is probably a little too long. <strong>Debug it.</strong>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Should Row B have different-size bricks, different-size gaps, or just different-size bricks on the end?</li>
                        <li>If you're not sure, try all the possibilities and see which looks right in the finished wall.</li>
                        <li>Or think "What would <em>make the most sense</em> in a <em>real</em> brick wall?"</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
		
        
        <p>Once you have rows A and B the same length, you are ready to write the <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/draw-brick-wall-7.png" alt="draw-brick-wall-7" /> block. To make it work you will need to distinguish between even and odd numbered rows.</p>
