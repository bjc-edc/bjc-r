        	<p><strong>In this project,</strong> you will use abstraction to draw a brick wall by starting with <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/drawBrick.png" alt="draw brick length:() width:() block" title="draw brick length:() width:() block"/>, then using that to write blocks for drawing rows, and ultimately creating <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/draw-brick-wall-7.png" alt="draw a Brick Wall with (7) Rows block" title="draw a Brick Wall with (7) Rows block" />.</p>

            <h4><strong>Abstraction</strong></h4>
            <p>Having a special <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/drawBrick.png" alt="drawBrick length:() width:() block" title="drawBrick length:() width:() block"/> block lets you use procedure names related to the problem you are solving (like <code>draw brick</code>), rather than the general-purpose procedure names (like <code>move</code>) that the computer uses for all kinds of tasks. The process of moving from what the programming language gives you to a natural language (one that humans speak) is a key part of good abstraction.</p>

		<h3>Drawing One Brick</h3>
        <p>
            A picture of a brick is just a rectangle with a brick red color. However, there's no <code>draw rectangle</code> block in <span class="snap">snap</span>. One way to draw one is by thinking of a rectangle as a very thick line. Here's the idea:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/simpleBrickCode.png" alt="draw rectangle, length:() width:() block definition" title="draw rectangle, length:() width:() block definition"/>
        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
       	  <ol>
				<li>
                	<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
                    Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2L4-brickwall.xml">this starter project</a>.  It includes the complete <code>draw brick</code> block shown below. Read the code; then try it out.<br />
                    <div class="sidenoteBig"> 
                        <p>The <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/setFlat.png"  alt="set flat line ends to &lt; &gt;"> block isn't built into Snap<em>!</em>. It was created for this project.</p>
                        <p>Ordinarily, Snap<em>!</em> draws thick lines with rounded ends: <img class="nopad" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/round-ends.png" alt="line with round ends">.  That's often the best choice, and you can see why below. But for bricks, we want flat line ends: <img class="nopad" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/flat-ends.png" alt="flat line ends">.</p>
                    <p class="center"><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/flat-line-ends-why.jpg" alt="" title="" /><br /><strong>flat</strong> vs. <strong>rounded</strong> line ends</p>

        <h3>Using Problem Decomposition to Write an Abstraction</h3>
		<p>
        	You'd like the "top level" block to be something like this:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/draw-brick-wall-7.png" alt="draw-brick-wall-7" /><br />
            Getting there involves <strong>problem decomposition</strong>: breaking the problem into smaller pieces.
        </p>
		<p>There are two kinds of rows, so we make blocks that specialize in each:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Row A</strong>: <img class="noshadow" border="0" title="Row A" alt="Row A" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/row-a.png" /></li>
			<li><strong>Row B</strong>: <img class="noshadow" border="0" title="Row B" alt="Row B" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/row-b.png" /></li>
		</ul>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="second">
        	<ol start="2">
            	<li>Use <code>draw brick</code> to make blocks <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/rowa-block.png" alt="Row A" /> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/rowb-block.png" alt="Row B" />.</li>
            	<!--<li>Think about what helper blocks besides <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick.png" alt="Draw Brick" /> you might want.</li>-->
            
        <!--<div class="takeNote"> 
          <p><strong>Too much abstraction? </strong>It's possible to go overboard on abstraction and build so many blocks that your program is just as cluttered as it would be without the special blocks. </p>
          <p>But it can also be useful to make a special block even when its definition is just one built-in block. For example, to draw the mortar (the cement between bricks, shown  as white space), you can just use <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/move4.png" alt="Move 4 Steps">, but it might make sense to define a <code>draw mortar</code> block. </p>
          <p>Why? You might later decide that 4 steps is the wrong thickness for mortar, and you'd rather have 5. Or you might want the mortar to be  cement-colored, slightly gray. And your complete project might have <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/move4.png" alt="Move 4 Steps"> blocks that <em>aren't</em> about mortar. With many <code>move</code> blocks scattered through your program, you would have to find and change each one, and keep putting in <code>set pen color</code> blocks. With a <code>draw mortar</code> block, you can just change its definition, and all the mortar in your picture will be changed.</p>
        </div>-->
            	<li>
                    <!--Mortar is not a word we need studetns to learn. Using "gap" instead. --MF <div class="sidenote">Mortar is a kind of cement that bricklayers use to hold the bricks together.</div>-->
                	The two kinds of rows should be exactly the same length.  Your first try at drawing Row B is probably a little too long. <strong>Debug it.</strong>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Should Row B have different-size bricks, different-size gaps, or just different-size bricks on the end?</li>
                        <li>If you're not sure, try all the possibilities and see which looks right in the finished wall.</li>
                        <li>Or think "What would <em>make the most sense</em> in a <em>real</em> brick wall?"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <div class="sidenote">You wrote the <code>even?</code> block <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/2-creating-predicates.html">in Lab 3</a>.</div>
                
                <li>Once you have  rows A and B the same length, write the <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/draw-brick-wall-7.png" alt="draw-brick-wall-7" /> block.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Check and Debug.</strong> Make sure that <code>draw Brick Wall</code> works properly by distinguishing between the even and odd numbered rows. There are several ways to do this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You might check whether <var>rows</var> &div; 2 is an integer.</li>
                        <li>You might use <var>rows</var> <code>mod</code> <var>2</var> with <code>=</code>.</li>
                        <li>You might think of another way...</li>
                    </ul>
                </li> 
			</ol>
            <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Would be a Good Time to Save" title="Now Would be a Good Time to Save" />
		</div>
       
        <div class="takeItFurther"><a name="further" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>
                	Add more inputs to <code>draw Brick Wall</code> (and as needed to <code>row A</code> and <code>row B</code>):<br />
        			<ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
                    	<li>Number of bricks per row</li>
				        <li>Length and width of a brick</li>
				        <li>Gap thickness</li>
                    </ol>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/drawBrickWallwithManyInputs.png"  height="60" alt="" title=""/><br />
                    Add these one at a time, not all at once!  When you modify the length of a brick, that should also change the length of a row B end brick. When you modify the gap thickness, that should also change the distance between the rows.
                </li>
                
                
            </ol>
        </div>
