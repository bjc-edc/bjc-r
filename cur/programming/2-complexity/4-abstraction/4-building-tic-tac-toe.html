            <strong>Why do this?</strong> Mainly because it introduces an extended project; having such a project is worthwhile to show kids that it's not all about trivial exercises.  But cloning is apparently popular with teachers, too.
            <p><strong>Why here?</strong> Multithreading is an important technique for dealing with complexity.</p>

        	<p><strong>Mary's 5/21/18 revision</strong>: I read and worked through this whole page. I had trouble understanding how clones work, so I made edits for clarity.

                Here is some of the critical teacher feedback (there was great feedback too!):
                <ul>
                    <li>I had to trace the code with the students for the Tic Tac Toe project and I used Jorge's handout. Most of the students spent way too much time trying to figure out the problem.</li>
                    <li>...my students are not really thinking through the projects.</li>
                    <li>...the whole Lab is very heavy for the students.</li>
                    <li>Students struggled with creating the tic tax toe board using clones</li>
                    <li>Students found it very difficult to understand</li>
                    <li>While most of my students can do simpler labs, most give up when confronted with a more sophisticated and nuanced situation.</li>
                </ul>

            <p><strong>In this <em>yearlong</em> project,</strong> you will  develop a program that plays Tic-Tac-Toe as well as you do.</p>
            <p><strong>On this first page,</strong> you display a Tic-Tac-Toe board and let two human players enter moves.</p>

        <div class="todo">The prior version of this paragraph read like it was explaining why we are doing it this way rather than the old way. The students won't have seen the old way, so that is unnecessary. If we want to compare versions (which I think might be too complex for here) we should actually show both versions and then compare--not just talk about something we have seen and they have not. --MF, 5/21/18</div>
		<p>One approach to building this game is to use <em>multiple sprites</em>; each square of the board is a separate sprite. Each sprite knows where it is on the board, and, once positioned, the sprites never move. The player clicks one of the nine squares, and that sprite changes its costume to display the move.</p>

        <p>You will use <em>clones</em> to create the 3&times;3 Tic-Tac-Toe board.</p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
            <p>A <strong>clone</strong> is a copy of a sprite that <em>shares information</em> with its parent sprite (the original sprite). For example, clones have copies of any scripts from the parent, and if the parent's script is changed, then the clones' scripts change too. However, changes to a clone are <em>not</em> shared with the parent, so you can do things like move each clone to a different position.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Clones start with the same position, costumes, and scripts of their parent. But...
            <ul>
                <li>Clones <em>don't</em> appear in the sprite corral.</li>
                <li>Clones are <em>temporary.</em> Clicking the stop button will delete all clones in the project.</li>

            	<div class="comment">I'm trying to make this more understandable. I found myself tripping on 9 clones vs. 8 because we didn't explain it. Now we do. I tried to be simple and clear about it. Success? --MF, 5/22/18</div>
                In this project, you'll need <em>nine</em> clones, one for each square of the Tic-Tac-Toe board. So, you'd need something like:<br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/9-copies.png" alt="repeat (9){create a clone of (myself)}" title="repeat (9){create a clone of (myself)}"><br />
	            The actual code you write will be slightly more than this, but this is the central idea. You'll need nine clones, and you will hide the parent. This will allow you to control the squares of the grid with blocks like:<br />

                    		<li>Note that <em>both</em> the clones and the parent <em>are sprites</em>. Both are clickable (try it) and draggable (try that too). This is different from the effects of the <code>stamp</code> Pen block, which just leaves a picture of the sprite on the stage.</li>
                            <li>The <code>create a clone</code> block takes an input because it can copy <em>any</em> sprite. In this project, there's only one sprite at the beginning, so your choices are either <var>myself</var> or <var>Square</var> (the sprite's name), which in this case, means the same thing.</li>

            The block is called <code>delete this clone</code> rather than <code>delete this sprite</code> because it only works for clones. When you click <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>, the parent sprite and all its clones will run this script, but only the clones will be deleted, leaving just the parent on the stage.
