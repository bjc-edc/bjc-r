    	<h2>Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board</h2>
<!--        <div class="todo">
        	From Al, 6/21/16:
            <ul>
            	<li>
                	The ``In this lab'' at the top:  Maybe a sidenote saying what the three illustrated games are.  And the animation is very distracting.  Can it run once and stop?
                    <ul>
                    	<li>We (Paul and I) agree, but the videos will need to be remade. I tried making them work that way, and it looked weird because they start white; so, you just see a play button (or rather, 3 of them). They should be rebuilt with an appealing first frame. --MF</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                	Problem 2: 
                	<ul>
                    	<li>Is it necessary (from the student perspective) to specify the type of input to draw tile?</li>
                		<li>Has anything been discussed about state invariance?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Problem 3:  should they play the game with their partner?</li>
                <li>Problem 4:  Why not ask them to make a ``go to starting place for board with---rows of tiles of size ----?</li>
            </ul>
            From Mary, 10.20.16:
            <ul>
            	<li>#3: "You can now drag and drop the first spite (the one with the "X" and "O" costumes) to play a game of Tic Tac Toe. " but only if they pick a good starting size, which we haven't given them. I happened to be building mine with size 22 until problem 4, and that made problem 3 a little weird.</li>
                <li>#4: I find the use of one block (<code>go to starting place</code>) to hide just one block (<code>go to x y</code>) a little non-intuitive. If we are going to use that block again somewhere else in the script, we should say that, and if we aren't (and I think we aren't), I don't think it makes sense to create it.</li>
                <li>#4: Adding <code>go to starting place</code> to my <code>draw square board</code> block definition might not be the right thing; I have the <code>pen down</code> block <em>outside</em> of <code>draw square board</code>, so it's going to make drag marks. If it needs to be inside, we should specify that.</li>
                <li>#4: Also, we aren't saying anything about the <code>point in direction</code> block, which is needed as much as <code>go to x y</code>. Perhaps it should also be in the <code>go to starting place</code> block, and maybe we could even call it <code>initialize</code> (or just <code>set up sprite to draw grid</code>).</li>
                <li>#5: This won't work if students put <code>clear</code> inside their <code>draw square board</code> block, which they will likely be inclined to do since we asked them to put <code>go to starting place</code> inside it; if the sprite isn't already at the starting place, they'll get drag marks if they don't either have the pen up or clear after moving to the starting place. It would be better to suggest using <code>draw tile</code> (and why draw a 1-1 array with a more complicated block when you can use a much simpler block?).</li>
            </ul>

                    Tic-Tac-Toe can be played on a board that is three rows of three squares each. You'll start by drawing a single square, then use that to draw a row of squares, and then use that to draw the entire board.

                                Why build <code>draw a tile</code><!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/tile(size).png" alt="tile of size (size)">--> when you could use <code>draw square</code><!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-square-block-with-empty-input.png" alt="draw square">--> or just the script inside it? Some projects, like building a 9x9 Sudoku board, can need more than one size of square with different thicknesses of borders. If you later decide to create a tile differently (maybe changing border or fill color), <!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/stamp.png" alt="stamp, from the Pen palette">--> it makes sense to edit just <code>draw a tile</code>; changing <code>draw square</code> would change <em>all</em>  squares in your project, not just board tiles.

                    To keep track of legal moves and wins, you'll need to know where each player moved. Import your <code>between?</code> predicate from your "U2L3-Predicates" project, and use it to write a <code>which tile</code> reporter. (It'll require more than one <code>if</code> block.)<!--(It'll require nine <code>if</code> tests.)--> Test it by having the sprite <code>say</code> which square it's in for a second when dropped.<br >

                <li>In the same script that draws the board to start a game, set <var>centers</var> to a list of nine points (using the abstract data type from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/2-data-types.html">Lab 2</a>), each of which is the center of the corresponding tile.</li>
                <li>In the <code>when I am dropped</code> script, if the sprite was dropped in a tile, move to its center before <code>stamp</code>ing it. (If it <em>wasn't</em> dropped inside a tile, don't stamp it and don't change costumes.)</li></ol>

                <li><strong>Check for illegal moves.</strong> You're already checking for dropping the sprite outside the board, but it's also illegal to drop the sprite inside a tile that's already occupied. To check for this, you'll have to keep track of the moves:
                  <ol type="a">
                <li>Make a global variable <var>board</var>.</li>
                <li>In the initialization script, set it to a list of nine items, each of which is the word <code>Empty</code>.</li>
                <li>When testing that the sprite is dropped in a tile, also test whether the corresponding item of <var>board</var> is <code>Empty</code>. If not, don't accept the move.</li>
                <li>If the move is legal, set the corresponding item of <var>board</var> to either X or O. You can check the  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/costume-number.png" alt="costume #"> to decide which.</li>
