    	<h2>Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board</h2>
<!--        <div class="todo">
        	From Al, 6/21/16:
            <ul>
            	<li>
                	The ``In this lab'' at the top:  Maybe a sidenote saying what the three illustrated games are.  And the animation is very distracting.  Can it run once and stop?
                    <ul>
                    	<li>We (Paul and I) agree, but the videos will need to be remade. I tried making them work that way, and it looked weird because they start white; so, you just see a play button (or rather, 3 of them). They should be rebuilt with an appealing first frame. --MF</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                	Problem 2: 
                	<ul>
                    	<li>Is it necessary (from the student perspective) to specify the type of input to draw tile?</li>
                		<li>Has anything been discussed about state invariance?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Problem 3:  should they play the game with their partner?</li>
                <li>Problem 4:  Why not ask them to make a ``go to starting place for board with---rows of tiles of size ----?</li>
            </ul>
            From Mary, 10.20.16:
            <ul>
            	<li>#3: "You can now drag and drop the first spite (the one with the "X" and "O" costumes) to play a game of Tic Tac Toe. " but only if they pick a good starting size, which we haven't given them. I happened to be building mine with size 22 until problem 4, and that made problem 3 a little weird.</li>
                <li>#4: I find the use of one block (<code>go to starting place</code>) to hide just one block (<code>go to x y</code>) a little non-intuitive. If we are going to use that block again somewhere else in the script, we should say that, and if we aren't (and I think we aren't), I don't think it makes sense to create it.</li>
                <li>#4: Adding <code>go to starting place</code> to my <code>draw square board</code> block definition might not be the right thing; I have the <code>pen down</code> block <em>outside</em> of <code>draw square board</code>, so it's going to make drag marks. If it needs to be inside, we should specify that.</li>
                <li>#4: Also, we aren't saying anything about the <code>point in direction</code> block, which is needed as much as <code>go to x y</code>. Perhaps it should also be in the <code>go to starting place</code> block, and maybe we could even call it <code>initialize</code> (or just <code>set up sprite to draw grid</code>).</li>
                <li>#5: This won't work if students put <code>clear</code> inside their <code>draw square board</code> block, which they will likely be inclined to do since we asked them to put <code>go to starting place</code> inside it; if the sprite isn't already at the starting place, they'll get drag marks if they don't either have the pen up or clear after moving to the starting place. It would be better to suggest using <code>draw tile</code> (and why draw a 1-1 array with a more complicated block when you can use a much simpler block?).</li>
            </ul>

                    A Tic-Tac-Toe board is three rows of three squares each. You'll start by drawing a single square, then use that to draw a row of squares, and then use that to draw the entire board. <strong>Be sure to test each block by itself before building a block that uses it.</strong>

                    I disagree. I think even the boldface is making too much of this Miss Mannersish scold. In fact I would argue for removing the sentence altogether. I certainly don't program that way! I write the program, then I debug it. That's how every programmer I know works. 
                    <br />This is an attempt to teach kids to be Software Engineers, but it's misguided.  Real software engineers (I mean, people who believe in the Miss Manners school of software development) program top-down, not bottom-up.--bh</div>

                      Build <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/draw-a-tile.png" alt="draw a tile"> to make a single square tile. You can import and call any <code>draw square</code> or <code>draw polygon</code> block that you've created earlier, or use primitive blocks directly.

                        <strong>Why abstraction?</strong> 
                        Why build <code>draw a tile</code><!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/tile(size).png" alt="tile of size (size)">--> when you could use <code>draw square</code><!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-square-block-with-empty-input.png" alt="draw square">--> or just the script inside it? Suppose you use squares for several purposes in a large project; maybe you have a Sudoku (9x9 board) player in addition to Tic-Tac-Toe. In case you later decide to create the tiles differently (maybe with thicker borders, filled with random colors, or by using <code>stamp</code>), <!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/stamp.png" alt="stamp, from the Pen palette">-->it makes sense to edit just <code>draw a tile</code> (because changing <code>draw square</code>  would change <em>all</em> the squares).
