        	One early case of "debugging" was when an actual moth got stuck inside a computer in 1947. Here is a page from Grace Hopper's notebook with the moth pasted in:

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Don't delete your project and start over.</strong> This sounds obvious when you see it written down, but programming students sometimes get angry at their bugs. Remember that if you have a program with 20 blocks in it, and one of the 20 has an error, then your program is 95% correct.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't <em>add</em> code to work around the bug.</strong> Don't edit the code at all until you understand why it's not doing what you intended, then remove the error. Think: "Debug by subtraction, not by addition."</li>
                <li><strong>Don't be hard on yourself.</strong> <em>Everyone</em> gets bugs in their programs; it's part of programming.</li>
                <li><strong>Reproduce the problem</strong> so you are sure you know how to recreate it. This will help you know when you've fixed it. </li>
                <li><strong>Isolate the piece of code producing the error.</strong> Test pieces of your code separately so you know what's working and what isn't.</li>
                <li><strong>Identify the specific cause of the error</strong> within that code. <em>Why</em> is that code doing the wrong thing?</li>
                <li><strong>Always test your code with different inputs.</strong> What if the input is really big, zero, negative, or a decimal? What if the user types something you aren't expecting? What if the user clicks somewhere else?</li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Love your bugs!</strong> They pose an interesting puzzle. Sometimes their incorrect behavior suggests another project:<br />

                <li>
                	<strong>Keep your code tidy.</strong> Delete unused blocks, and use Snap<em>!</em>&#x2009;'s "clean up" feature to organize your code.
                </li>
                <li>
					<strong>Use meaningful names</strong> for blocks and variables. Some programmers try to save time by naming all their variables <var>x</var>. But if they forget and call a <em>second</em> variable <var>x</var>, this can lead to bugs.  So, to make your programs easier to understand and easier to debug, use meaningful names, like <var>horizontal position</var>, instead.
                </li>
                <li>
	                <strong>Use abstraction</strong> to hide the complexity of code. Abstraction is a way of thinking; you tuck some details into one part of your code and get them working right, and then use that chunk confidently, just as if it were built into Snap<em>!</em>. Some examples of using abstraction include creating custom blocks and using abstract data types. These kinds of abstraction allow you to build and test pieces of your code one at a time, so bugs are automatically isolated.
