        	It is possible to <em>nest</em> one <code>repeat</code> block inside another. Since <span class="snap">snap</span> processes scripts from top to bottom, the first <code>repeat</code> will begin first, and the second <code>repeat</code> will have to complete all its repetitions before the first <code>repeat</code> continues.<br />

		<h3>Using Abstraction to Nest Triangles</h3>
        <p>Does all this copying and pasting of code feel awkward to you? You know a better way: <em>abstraction</em>.  In Unit 1 you used a <code>pinwheel</code> block to implement <code>asterisk</code> and <code>polygon</code>, rather than copying the code. Here, you can use a block to manage the abstraction too, but in this case, we want very similar code (a smaller triangle) repeated inside, so we will actually <em>use the same block inside itself</em>.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="9">
				<li>	Create a <code>repeatedTriangle</code> block.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                        	Design the block with two inputs, <var>size</var> and <var>color</var>.<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/repeatedTriangleHeader.png"  alt="repeatedTriangle, size: (size) color: (color) hat block" title="repeatedTriangle, size: (size) color: (color) hat block" /><br />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                             Use your first unnamed triangle script from problem 1 as a model. To have an input for the color, you'll have to use the numeric <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-pen-color-to-numeric.png" alt="set pen color to (0)" title="set pen color to (0)" /> block instead of the <em>color-picker</em> block <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-pen-color-to-picker.png" alt="set pen color to (blue colored square)" title="set pen color to (blue colored square)" />.<br />
                             <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/first-triangle-script.png" alt="repeat (3) {set pen color to (0), move (100) steps, turn right (120) degrees}" title="repeat (3) {set pen color to (0), move (100) steps, turn right (120) degrees}" />
                        </li>
                        <li>Click the "Apply" button in the Block Editor so that the block appears in the palette on the left.</li>
                        <li>
                            Where you would have dragged in another copy of the script (between the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks), drag in a <code>repeatedTriangle</code> block.  The <var>size</var> input should be half the current value of <var>size</var>; the <var>color</var> input should be ten more than its current value.<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/repeatedTriangleRecursive.png" alt="repeatedTriangle, size (size/2) color: (color+10)" title="repeatedTriangle, size (size/2) color: (color+10)" /><br />
                            <div class="endnote">You are using <code>repeatedTriangle</code> in its own definition.  When a block refers to itself, the block is said to be <em>recursive</em>.  Recursion is one of the most powerful techniques in computer science and you will learn more about it in later projects.</div>
                        </li>
                	</ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Try <code>repeatedTriangle</code> with a size of <var>100</var> and a color number of <var>0</var>. It won't work as expected. Think through the steps in the code. Can you determine what is happening?<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/repeatedTriangleApplied.png" alt="repeatedTriangle, size: (100) color: (0)" title="repeatedTriangle, size: (100) color: (0)"/>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    The trouble with this definition is that, as it stands, you'll keep getting smaller and smaller triangles forever.  To prevent that, put the entire definition of <code>repeatedTriangle</code> inside a conditional to stop the triangles from nesting forever:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/end-test.png" alt="if (size &gt; 2)" title="if (size &gt; 2)" />
                    <div class="endnote">Experiment with values other than 2 (such as 40, 20, 10, 5) to see how this condition determines how small the smallest repeated triangles will be.</div> 
                </li>
                <div class="sidenote">If the color variations are not showing in your drawings, click on the block <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/setColorRed.png"  height="30" alt=""/> to establish a color baseline.</div>
                <li>
                    Now, try <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/repeatedTriangleApplied.png" alt="repeatedTriangle, size: (100) color: (0)" title="repeatedTriangle, size: (100) color: (0)"/> again.
                </li>
                <li>Save your work as U2L4-RepeatedTriangle. <img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-mini.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work"></li>
