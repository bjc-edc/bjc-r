            <p>Snap<em>!</em> has a debugging tool called <strong>Visible Stepping</strong> that allows you to control how quickly Snap<em>!</em> steps through the blocks of your code. This lets you see the effect of each block one-by-one to help you understand any errors in your code.</p>
            <!--<a href="#hint-visible-stepping" data-toggle="collapse" title="Learn Visible Stepping in Snap!"><br />Click for a demo.</a>
            <div id="hint-visible-stepping" class="collapse">-->
                <p>After clicking the Visible Stepping button (<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/visible-stepping.png" alt="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" title="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" />), you can adjust the slider to control the stepping speed.

		<h3>Using Abstraction to Nest Triangles</h3>
        <p>Does all this copying and pasting of code feel awkward to you? You know a better way: <em>abstraction</em>.  In Unit 1 you used a <code>pinwheel</code> block to implement <code>asterisk</code> and <code>polygon</code>, rather than copying the code. Here, you can use a block to manage the abstraction too, but in this case, we want very similar code (a smaller triangle) nested inside, so we will actually <em>use the same block inside itself</em>.</p>
        
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="9">
                <li>	
                    Create a <code>nested triangle</code> block.

                        <li>Click the "Apply" button in the Block Editor so that the block appears in the palette on the left.</li>
                        <li><strong>Try out this block</strong> giving at least the inputs 9, 18,  20 and 100 to make sure it works as you expect.</li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    In problem #4, you dragged a copy of the script between the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks. You can do a similar thing with your <em>block</em>.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            From the palette, drag a copy of that <code>nested triangle</code> block into the editor and insert it <em>in</em> the definition of <code>nested triangle</code> between the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks.  Make its <var>size</var> input  half the current value of <var>size</var>.<br />
