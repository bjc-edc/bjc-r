		<h3>Using Abstraction to Nest Triangles</h3>
        <p>Does all this copying and pasting of code feel awkward to you? You know a better way: <em>abstraction</em>.  In Unit 1 you used a <code>pinwheel</code> block to implement <code>asterisk</code> and <code>polygon</code>, rather than copying the code. Here, you can use a block to manage the abstraction too, but in this case, we want very similar code (a smaller triangle) nested inside, so we will actually <em>use the same block inside itself</em>.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="9">
				<li>	Create a <code>nested triangle</code> block.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                        	Design the block with one input, <var>size</var>. For now, leave out the part about changing colors.<br />

                        <li>
							Use your first unnamed triangle script from problem 1 as a model. But since we're going to be nesting this script inside itself, we're going to be making smaller and smaller triangles, until finally they're too small to see. To avoid that, we'll make the triangle only if it's big enough:<br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/triangle.png" alt="repeat 3; move 100 steps; right 120 degrees"><br />
							Also, put the <var>size</var> input where it belongs in this script to control the size of the triangle.
                        </li>
                        <li>Click the "Apply" button in the Block Editor so that the block appears in the palette on the left.</li>
                        <li>
                            Where you would have dragged in another copy of the script (between the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks), drag in a <code>nested triangle</code> block.  The <var>size</var> input should be half the current value of <var>size</var>.<br />
