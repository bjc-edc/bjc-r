                    I find it odd that we have two images from the TIF in this pink box. Why not use this? --MF, 3/21/18<br />

                    ST- The image proposed is identical to what we have in FYTD#7 and in the two debugging videos.  The animations in the pink box are not the same as in the TIF.  The TIF versions involve an animated parameter guiding the changing rotations of the smaller versions of the polygons.  Whereas the pink box versions do not have any changing rotations.  So I would vote against the change.
                </p>
                <p>My concern is that these images don't look like what the students so on this page. They don't make these images. Right? We don't have to resolve this now though. We can leave this for later. :) --MF, 3/22/18</p>

			<h4><strong>Debugging with Visible Stepping</strong></h4>
			
            <p>Snap<em>!</em> has a debugging tool called <strong>Visible Stepping</strong> that allows you to control how quickly Snap<em>!</em> steps through the blocks of your code. This lets you see the effect of each block one-by-one to help you understand any errors in your code.</p>
           
                <p>After clicking the Visible Stepping button (<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/visible-stepping.png" alt="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" title="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" />), you can adjust the slider to control the stepping speed. The sprite executes the each step of the code as it is highlighted in <span style="color: black; background-color:cyan">cyan</span>.</p>

                <p>If you move the slider to the slowest setting (all the way to the left), the shape of the yellow Run/Pause button will change, and you can press it to <em>single step</em> through your code. This can help you see what happens at a specific point.</p>

		<h3>Using Abstraction to Nest Triangles</h3>
        <p>Does all this copying and pasting of code feel awkward to you? You know a better way: <em>abstraction</em>.  In Unit 1 you used a <code>pinwheel</code> block to implement <code>asterisk</code> and <code>polygon</code>, rather than copying the code. Here, you can use a block to manage the abstraction too, but in this case, we want very similar code (a smaller triangle) nested inside, so we will actually <em>use the same block inside itself</em>.</p>

                        <li>Click the "Apply" button in the Block Editor so that the block appears in the palette on the left.</li>

                <li>
                    In problem #4, you dragged a copy of the script between the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks. You can do a similar thing with your <em>block</em>.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            From the palette, drag a copy of that <code>nested triangle</code> block into the editor and insert it <em>in</em> the definition of <code>nested triangle</code> between the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks.  Make its <var>size</var> input  half the current value of <var>size</var>.<br />
