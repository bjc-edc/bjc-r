            <p>PG: This follows the principle of practice something you've learned, learn something new, foreshadow something cool.  The page is very long, and the key foreshadowing comes after step #8.  I would /not/ asterisk this page. Important stuff is happening here.</p>
            <p>BH: After dragging the different color triangle scripts into each other, start over, making blocks big-triangle, medium-triangle, and small-triangle, then drag the named block into the next bigger one, instead of dragging scripts.  This will prepare better for the recursive version.</p>

                    I find it odd that we have two images from the TIF in this pink box. Why not use this? --MF, 3/21/18<br />

                    ST- The image proposed is identical to what we have in FYTD#7 and in the two debugging videos.  The animations in the pink box are not the same as in the TIF.  The TIF versions involve an animated parameter guiding the changing rotations of the smaller versions of the polygons.  Whereas the pink box versions do not have any changing rotations.  So I would vote against the change.
                </p>
                <p>My concern is that these images don't look like what the students so on this page. They don't make these images. Right? We don't have to resolve this now though. We can leave this for later. :) --MF, 3/22/18 <br />
                ST-They actually do.  Aside from the color and orientation, these are exactly what the kids work on this page.</p>

		<h3>Using Abstraction to Nest Triangles</h3>
        <p>Does all this copying and pasting of code feel awkward to you? You know a better way: <em>abstraction</em>.  In Unit 1 you used a <code>pinwheel</code> block to implement <code>asterisk</code> and <code>polygon</code>, rather than copying the code. Here, you can use a block to manage the abstraction too, but in this case, we want very similar code (a smaller triangle) nested inside, so we will actually <em>use the same block inside itself</em>.</p>

                    In problem #4, you dragged a copy of the script between the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks. You can do a similar thing with your <em>block</em>.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            From the palette, drag a copy of that <code>nested triangle</code> block into the editor and insert it <em>in</em> the definition of <code>nested triangle</code> between the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks.
