        <h4><strong>Debugging Tip</strong>: Visible stepping in Snap<em>!</em>.</h4>
        Snap<em>!</em> has a fantastic debugging tool called <strong><em>Visible stepping</em></strong> which will allow you to step through the blocks of your code one by one as each block is being executed, revealing the effect of each block.  You can adjust the speed of this stepping and even bring it to a halt if you choose.  If there are errors in your program, stepping will help you identify the block(s) causing the errors.

                <div id="hint-visible-stepping" class="collapse">
                <p>Below you see an animation about how to use <strong><em>Visible stepping</em></strong> in Snap<em>!</em>.  Be sure to <strong>watch the code</strong> not just what the sprite does.  Notice how it is possible to adjust the speed at which the stepping is done.  During the stepping, the color of the block currently being executed changes to <span style="color:#00F5F5">cyan</span>.  Notice how stepping is done when there is a loop within a loop.</p>

                <p>In <strong><em>Visible stepping</em></strong>, if you bring the slider all the way to the left, then you can <em>single-step</em> your code by pressing the Pause/Play button next to the Green Flag.</p>

		<h3>Using Abstraction to Nest Triangles</h3>
        <p>Does all this copying and pasting of code feel awkward to you? You know a better way: <em>abstraction</em>.  In Unit 1 you used a <code>pinwheel</code> block to implement <code>asterisk</code> and <code>polygon</code>, rather than copying the code. Here, you can use a block to manage the abstraction too, but in this case, we want very similar code (a smaller triangle) nested inside, so we will actually <em>use the same block inside itself</em>.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="9">
				<li>	Create a <code>nested triangle</code> block.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                        	Design the block with one input, <var>size</var>. For now, leave out the part about changing colors.<br />

                        <li>
				      Use your first unnamed triangle script from problem 1 as a model. But add one condition: draw the triangle only if it's big enough:<br />

                        <li>Click the "Apply" button in the Block Editor so that the block appears in the palette on the left.</li>
                        <li><strong>Try out this block</strong> giving at least the inputs 9, 18,  20 and 100 to make sure it works as you expect.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>
                            In problem #4, you dragged a copy of the script between the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks. You can do a similar thing with your <em>block</em>.
<ol>
        <li>From the palette, drag a copy of that <code>nested triangle</code> block into the editor and insert it <em>in</em> the definition of <code>nested triangle</code> between the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks.  Make its <var>size</var> input  half the current value of <var>size</var>.<br />
