            <p><strong>Tic Tac Toe Phase 1</strong>: You will create the basic <em>Human versus Human</em> game where the computer simply takes care of displaying the X’s and O’s and the users themselves decide on a win or a draw.   Playing with the final product will feel a lot like two players playing the game with paper and pencil.  In this phase, you will create the Tic Tac Toe board by <em>cloning</em> a clickable square sprite with three costumes: Empty, X and O.</p>

                <li>Play with <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/new/6b-newTTT-phase1-interactive.html" target="_blank">this example</a> to get a feel for the Phase 1 version of Tic Tac Toe. </li>
                <li>
                    Open this <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/U2-TTT-phase1-student.xml" target="_blank">starter project</a> to begin your Phase 1 Tic Tac Toe.  A sprite, named <code>Square</code>, has already been created for you with three costumes: Empty, X and O.<br />

                </li>
                <li>You will be using the cloning feature in Snap<em>!</em> to create the 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board as it is a speedier alternative to creating and keeping track of 9 separate sprites: <code>Square1, Square2, … Square9</code>.  Study <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/U2-CloningExample.xml" target="_blank">this example</a>  file and do the task given there to gain some experience with the basics of cloning in Snap!.</li>
                <li>
                    Create a new sprite called <code>Board</code> and use it to build the Tic Tac Toe board with clones of <code>Square</code> using the following blocks. <br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/TTT1_img/CreateCloneOf.png" width="243" alt="create a clone of (Square) block" title="create a clone of (Square) block"/>

                    The second of these blocks does not appear by default in your Control menu but you can import it via the File menu’s "Import tools" option.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/TTT1_img/ImportTools.png"  height="250" alt="Import tools" title="Import tools"/><br />
                    Experiment until you can position the <code>Square</code>’s clones correctly on the stage building the board row by row without overlap.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/TTT1_img/Row1.png"  height="100" alt="One row of squares" title="One row of squares"/>
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/TTT1_img/Row2.png"  height="100" alt="Two rows of squares" title="Two rows of squares"/>

                </li>
                <p>To build the Tic Tac Toe board you may find the following blocks helpful:</p>
                <div class="sidenote">The <code>warp</code> block can be used to draw the board all at once rather than square by square.</div>
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/TTT1_img/MakeBoardBlocks.png" width="500" alt="Hint blocks to build the Tic Tac Toe board" title="Hint blocks to build the Tic Tac Toe board"/><br />
                <li>After cloning nine times to create the board, <code>hide</code> the original <code>Square</code> so it does not interfere with the game as a tenth square.  Be sure to <code>show</code> the original <code>Square</code> initially, as it will be hidden by a previous run and thus its clones would not be visible.</li>
                <li>
                    By default, each <code>Square</code> clone should have the Empty costume.  Now create code that will allow each <code>Square</code> clone to put on the proper costume when clicked: X or O depending on whose turn it is. Also think, how should a square behave when it is clicked while already wearing an X or O costume.<br />
                    (Hint:  If you keep track of the number of moves made so far with a variable named <var>counter</var>, you will be able to use the oddness/evenness of this count to determine whose turn it is.  You can use the <code>mod</code> block to in the Operators menu to determine oddness/evenness.)  
                    <div class="takeNote">
                        The <code>mod</code> function gives the remainder when the first input is divided by the second.  For example, 
                        <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/TTT1_img/6mod2.png"  height="35" alt="(6) mod (2) block" title="(6) mod (2) block"/> reports 0, as 6 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 0. Also, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/TTT1_img/7mod2.png" height="35" alt="(7) mod (2) block" title="(7) mod (2) block"/> reports 1, as 7 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1. Thus, you can use a number mod 2 to determine if the number is odd or even. 
                    </div>
                </li>
                <p>You may find the following blocks useful while writing the code for the <code>Square</code>.</p>
