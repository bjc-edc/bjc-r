        <h2>Working with Recursive Reporters</h2>
        <p>Here's Betty's code for the <code>segments in tree</code> function:</p>

        <div class="takeNote">The <code>report</code> block only connects to the blocks <em>above</em> it. That's because <code>report</code> returns the result of its input slot, immediately, as the output of the <code>segments in tree</code> reporter block. No further code is executed in a reporter after a <code>report</code> block.</div>
