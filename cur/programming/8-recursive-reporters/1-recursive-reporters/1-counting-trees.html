            <p>PG: Generic editing: Beta doesn't have a consistent name. Sometimes Betty, sometimes Jasmine. General comment: I don't feel like we've settled on a goal and really crafted a sequence to reach it. I think we're showing off all sorts of things that can be done with recursion, rather than thinking about how to /teach/ recursion and structuring this so that the student really becomes the master. This page: I basically like this, but I feel it is less focused on helping a kid write a recursive reporter than on the mathematics.  Morgan's solution and the first four lines of the TOL are clever but, for our purposes, irrelevant. Worse, if we want to build a power of 2 block, we should teach how to do /that/ recursively. The method here (last two lines of TOL) does, sort of, do that, but because the focus is elsewhere (and we never draw it back), it is likely to be special purpose. We don't see the right abstraction, Morgan's "one less than a power of 2." </p>

            <p>PG: Drastic change, based on whatever we do with "counting branches" (not trees—there's only one tree), this should change. The reporter is so special-purpose, whereas a n^m block is both /less/ complex (more straightforward) and /more/ generally useful, e.g., for counting the triangle's children.</p>

        <div class="takeNote">The <code>report</code> block only connects to the blocks <em>above</em> it.
