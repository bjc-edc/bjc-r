        <h2>Ice Cream Bowls</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>PG: This could be better if it started "There are lots of problems like…." and gave a few examples. Then students are seeing something general, rather than an arbitrary word problem about ice cream, which seems a pretty trivial thing to ask a programmer to teach a computer to solve.</p>
            
            <p>MF: Scrap. These feels like a math problem. Maybe should be an optional proejct. What does this add here?</p>

            <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will explore a classic computer science problem: subsets.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will explore a familiar introduction subsets: choosing flavors of ice cream.</p>

            <p>A <strong>subset</strong> is a selection of items from a set; it can be none, all, or any number in between.</p>

            There are lots of problems that are about subsets. For example, 
            <ul>
                <li>There are 20 students in the class and you want a committee four. How many combinations of 4 people are there?</li>
                <li>How many combinations are there on a Simplex lock?  (A Simplex lock has five buttons, where you can use each one once, but you can press them at the same time. See image at right.)</li>
                <li>A store has eight flavors of ice cream. How many combinations of ice cream flavors can you chose for a bowl with a given number of scoops?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            For now, all scoops must be different from one another. The order of the scoops doesn't matter: a bowl with vanilla and chocolate is the same as a bowl with chocolate and vanilla.
            <ol>
                <li>How many 2-scoop bowls are there? Find a systematic way of listing them.</li>
                <li>Look for a way to describe the problem using recursion.</li>
                <li><div class="sidenote">You may want to use the <code>append</code> block seen in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/8-recursive-reporters/6-sorting/3-partition-sort.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F8-recursive-reporters.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 8 Lab 2 Page 3: Partition Sort</a>.</div>Build a block that reports a list of lists, all 2-scoop bowls given a variable-length input list of available flavors.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        The block you built for 2-scoop bowls can help you build a block for 3-scoop bowls.
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="4">
                <li>Build a block that lists all 3-scoop bowls, given a list of the available flavors. Remember, the order of the scoops doesn't matter, so think about how you might avoid listing the same bowl more than once.</li>
                <li><div class="sidenote">That bowl either has chocolate, or it doesn't...</div>Generalize to build a block that lists all <em>n</em>-scoop bowls, with an additional input giving the number of scoops. This will definitely need recursion!</li>

        </div>
        
        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <ol type="A">
            	<li>Remove the restriction that each scoop must be a different flavor: chocolate, chocolate, and chocolate is now allowed, and many more.</li>
            </ol>
