            From michael (via GH):
            <ul>
                <li>if discussing "index" variables, the word "position" should be used. The for each item is confusing because item is not an index. Using it on a word is OK, IMO, but there really needs to be an explicit comparison of the same operation between map / for each / explicit indexing if you want students to see the difference.</li>
                <li>@brianharvey: Your selection sort has a minor bug which filters out duplicate data. I don't know if there's a clean way to do it with a keep though, so a different version probably isn't as pretty.</li>

    	<p>Lists are essential to efficient data management. Lists can be counted, added to, removed from, selected from, searched in, and sorted. In this lesson, you will refine your Shopping List App, and you will explore common programming tasks related to lists: indexing, swapping, and sorting.</p>

                            Perhaps you coded your "Add Item" button to check to see if the item you want to add is already on the list so you don't create duplicates. Either way, create a "Clean Up List" button that removes any duplicate items from the list. Here are some instructions:

		<h3>Using an Index Variable</h3>
        <div class="todo">The content in this section was adapted from a former U3 investigation: <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/investigations/processing-a-sentence.html">Processing a Sentence</a></div>
<div class="comment">Is this in the framework or something?  Because the way I'd write <code>spell word</code> is<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/bh-spell-word.png"></div>
<p>Part of what makes lists so powerful is that lists are ordered and each item in the list has an <em>index number</em> that you can use to refer to that particular item. But using an index variable to process a bunch of values is not specific to lists! Creating an index from scratch is fairly common in programming and worth getting comfortable with.</p>
        <p>This block says each of the items in a list:<br /><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/index-read-list.png" alt="read through list (list) block definition" title="read through list (list) block definition" /></p>
        <p>The block says all of the letters in a sentence:<br /><a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/old/U3L1-IndexVariable.xml"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/index-spell-word.png" alt="spell word (word) block definition" title="spell word (word) block definition" /></a></p>
                    
        <p>Since there is no <code>for each letter</code> block that indexes strings of characters as if they were in a list, we must create an index variable and increase it by 1 (<em>increment</em> it) each time through the loop.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">

        <h3>Swapping Variable Contents</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
                <li>
                	Another common programming task is swapping the values of two variables or items in a list. So, it's worth building a custom block (or two&mdash;one for variables and one for lists) to get familiar with the idea:
                    <ol>
                    	<li><div class="newProject"><span class="text">"U3L1-Swap"</span><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/new-project-called.png" alt="Create a new project called U3L1-Swap" title="Create a new project called U3L1-Swap" /></div></li>
	<div class="comment">The page <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/old-labs/lists/mutation/mutate-vars.html">bjc-r/cur/programming/old labs/lists/mutation/mutate-vars.html </a>explains why this won't work!</div>
					<div class="sidenote">A script variable to hold one value aside will be useful here.<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Discuss how you will use it.</div>
                        <li>
                            Write a Variables command block called <code>swap</code> that takes two variables as input and swaps their values. For example, if <var>variable1</var> is <var>100</var> and <var>variable2</var> is <var>200</var>, and these are inputted into <code>swap</code>, <var>variable1</var> should then be <var>200</var> and <var>variable2</var> should be <var>100</var>.<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/swap-var-empty.png" alt="swap () ()" title="swap () ()" /><br />

                        <div class="endnote">Command blocks can change the values stored in the input variable(s), but they do not  report a value.</div>
						<li>
                        	Write a Lists command block called <code>swap with</code> that takes two index numbers <em>and a list</em> as input and swaps the two list items with those index numbers. For example, this script swaps the 2nd and 5th items of the list assigned to the variable <var>alphabet</var>:<br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/swap-list-example.png" alt="set (alphabet) to (list () () () () () () ()), swap (2) with (5) in (alphabet)" title="set (alphabet) to (list () () () () () () ()), swap (2) with (5) in (alphabet)" />

					</ol>
				</li></ol>
<div class="takeNote"><strong>A note on list block types:</strong>
        <ul>
                        <li>List <em>reporters</em> perform some kind of calculation <em>with</em> a list (but generally <em>without changing</em> the list), and they <em>report</em> information, perhaps a modified list.</li>
                        <li>List <em>commands</em> perform some kind of calculation <em>on</em> a list. They may <em>actually change the original list</em> and  have <em>no output</em>.</li>

              <div class="todo">Is this any different from what we already know about commands and reporters?  What I think you really want to say here is this:  <div class="takeNote">There are two very different styles of programming: <em>functional</em> programming, in which you mostly use reporters, and compute new values rather than modify values of variables that already exist; and <em>imperative</em> programming, in which you mostly use commands, and change the values of variables all the time.  All else being equal, functional programming is better because it leads to fewer bugs and because it's much easier to parallelize.  But sometimes it's more efficient or just plain easier to use imperative programming style.  In Snap<em>!</em>, because of the way lists are implemented, it's important for efficiency reasons to use a consistent style for any particular list&mdash;either always use red command blocks to mutate the list, or always use reporters such as <code>in front of</code> or <code>keep</code> to compute new lists based on the old one.</div>  But it's much too early to say that, which is why this whole page, if it belongs anywhere, belongs in Lab 4.</div>

        <h3>Sorting a List</h3>
        
<div class="todo">(1) This animation goes way too fast to read.  (2) Here's how I'd want them to think about selection sort:
  <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/bh-selection-sort.png"><br />
... but that's recursive, so if we had to do it in this unit, I guess I'd settle for  <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/bh-iter-select-sort.png"><br />
... but you can see how much uglier that is.  So I'd rather do sorting in U7.
<strong>PG: Sorting is not appropriate here. It's complicated, the technique should be recursive, and it's not needed.</strong>
