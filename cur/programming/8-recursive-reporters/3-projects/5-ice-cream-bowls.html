        <h2>Ice Cream Bowls</h2>
        <div class="sidenote">For now, all scoops must be different from one another.</div><p>A store has eight flavors of ice cream. You can order a bowl that has 1, 2, or 3 different scoops in it. The order of the scoops doesn't matter: a bowl with vanilla and chocolate is the same as a bowl with chocolate and vanilla.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>How many 2-scoop bowls are there? Find a systematic way of listing them.</li>
                <li>Look for a way to describe the problem using recursion.</li>
                <li><div class="sidenote">You may want to use the <code>append</code> block seen in Lab 2.</div>Build a block that reports a list of lists, all 2-scoop bowls given a variable-length input list of available flavors.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        The block you built for 2-scoop bowls can help you build a block for 3-scoop bowls.
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="4">
                <li>Build a block that lists all 3-scoop bowls, given a list of the available flavors. Remember, the order of the scoops doesn't matter, so think about how you might avoid listing the same bowl more than once.</li>
                <li><div class="sidenote">That bowl either has chocolate, or it doesn't...</div>Generalize to build a block that lists all <em>n</em>-scoop bowls, with an additional input giving the number of scoops. This will definitely need recursion!</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <ol start="6">
            	<li>Remove the restriction that each scoop must be a different flavor: chocolate, chocolate, and chocolate is now allowed, and many more.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
