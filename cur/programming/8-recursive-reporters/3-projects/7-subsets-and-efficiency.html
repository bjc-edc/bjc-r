        <h2>Subsets and Efficiency</h2>
        <p>
            Here is one solution for the <code>subsets</code> block:<br />

        </p>
        
        <p>This solution should remind you of the <code>pascal</code> block, which makes two recursive calls and adds the results. The <code>pascal</code> block makes two recursive calls <em>with different inputs</em>. This version of <code>subsets</code> makes <em>the same</em> recursive call twice, an inefficiency that can be corrected.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Using a <code>count</code> variable, as you did for the <code>pascal</code> block, count how many recursive calls are made to find the 64 subsets of a six-element list.</li>
                <li>Figure out how to reduce the number of recursive calls by avoiding redundant calls.</li>
