        <h2>Pascal's Triangle and Efficiency</h2>
        <p>
        	Here's one solution to the <code>pascal</code> block:<br />
        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/pascal-script.png" alt="pascal script" />
        </p>
        <p>There are two base cases, the beginning and end of a row. The recursive case calculates the sum of two values in the previous row.</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/pascal145.png" alt="14th row, 5th column" /> = <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/pascal134.png" alt="13th row, 4th column" /> + <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/pascal135.png" alt="13th row, 5th column" /></p>

        <p>You are about to figure out how many recursive calls are needed to compute a value in Pascal's Triangle.</p>

        <p>As a first approximation, pretend that the computation would never reach a base case until row 0. Then a value in row 10 will make two recursive calls into row 9. Each of those will make two recursive calls, for a total of four into row 8. Each of <em>those</em> makes two recursive calls, so there are eight calls into row 7, 16 into row 6, 32 into row 5, 64 into row 4, 128 into row 3, 256 into row 2, 512 into row 1, and 1024 into row 0!</p>
        <p>In reality the situation isn't quite so bad, because by row 5 you're already hitting the ends of the row. But still, roughly speaking, it takes something like <span class="katex">2^n</span> recursive calls to find a value near the middle of row <span class="katex">n</span> of the triangle.</p>

                    Make a global variable called <code>count</code> and set it to 0. Modify your <code>pascal</code> script to keep count of recursive calls:
                    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/pascal-count.png" alt="pascal script with counter" /></p>
                    <p>How many calls are actually made when you compute <code>pascal(10,5)</code>? <code>pascal(12,6)</code>? (Don't forget to reset <code>count</code> to 0 for each experiment.) Make a guess for <code>pascal(14,7)</code> and see how close you come.</p>

        <p>Many of the recursive calls are redundant. For example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/pascal145.png" alt="14th row, 5th column" /> will call <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/pascal103.png" alt="10th row, 3th column" /> many times, asking for the same information.</p>
