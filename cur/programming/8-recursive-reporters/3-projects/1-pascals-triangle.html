        <h2>Pascal's Triangle</h2>
        <p>In <strong>Pascal's Triangle</strong>, each number is the sum of the two numbers above it. The numbers at the ends of each row are always 1.</p>
        <div class="todo"> The HTML in this triangle needs to be cleaned up. --MF </div>
        <p align="center">
            <strong>Row 1:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />
            <strong>Row 2:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />
            <strong>Row 3:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />
            <strong>Row 4:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />
            <strong>Row 5:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />
            <strong>Row 6:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;15&nbsp;&nbsp;20&nbsp;&nbsp;15&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¸™
        </p>
        <p>For example, each 15 in Row 6 is the sum of the 5 and 10 just above it.</p>

		<p>
        	To refer to a specific number in Pascal's Triangle, you need to know its row and column. Rows are simple; columns are more complicated because of the triangle's orientation. Here is Pascal's Triangle, aligned in columns:<br />
			<div class="todo">The alignment here is still a little messy. Some sort of tabular environment could get it more precisely right. I removed the "blockquote" environment since it italicized everything. I can't figure out how to "center" this as a block while still keeping its visible alignment. -BK<ol><li>I would fix this, but I'm not clear what's intended... -MF</li></ol></div>
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />
            1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />
            1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />
            1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />
            1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />
            1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;15&nbsp;&nbsp;20&nbsp;&nbsp;15&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1
		</p>
		<div class="takeNote">By convention (because it turns out to be useful), the columns in Pascal's Triangle are named starting from 0, not 1. For example, the number in row 4, column 1 of Pascal's Triangle is <strong>4</strong>, not 1.</div>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="3">
                <li>What number is in row 6, column 2 of Pascal's Triangle?</li>
                <li>Two numbers in row 5 are added to produce the number in row 6, column 2. What are their locations?</li>
                <li>To determine the number in row 14, column 5 of Pascal's Triangle, you would need to know two numbers from row 13. In which columns in row 13 are those numbers?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

		<p>Pascal's Triangle counts the number of ways to pick a collection from larger collection. For more  about Pascal's Triangle and its uses, see <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/8-recursive-reporters/3-projects/extras/1-pascal-context.html">this page.</a></p>
        
        <div class="sidenoteBig">What are the base cases? The work in earlier problems should help you figure out the recursion. Try more examples if you're not sure.</div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
