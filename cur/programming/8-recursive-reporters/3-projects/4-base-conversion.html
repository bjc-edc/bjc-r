        <h2>Base Conversion</h2>

        <p>Here's one solution for binary conversion of non-negative integers:</p>
        <p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/tobinary.png" alt="decimal-&gt;binary" /></p>
        <p>If a  number can be represented with only a single  digit, we use it as the base case. For binary, the only numbers that can be represented with a single digit are 0 and 1, so we test to see if the number is less than 2. If so, we report it.</p>
        <p><div class="sidenote">It may be surprising that we don't use an arithmetic combiner, but the desired result is a <em>numeral</em>, a text string. This is why the combiner is a string operation.</div>In the recursive case, the rightmost binary digit is the remainder when dividing the number by 2. The other digits come from a recursive call on the quotient when dividing by 2. The combiner is <code>join</code> because we want to string the digits together.</p>

       <p> 	Long ago, when computer circuits were very unreliable, some computers used a representation called <em>biquinary,</em> which used decimal digits, each of which was represented using five bits, of which exactly two had to be 1, and the other three had to be 0.  The five bits represented the values 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7. (Yes, that's a strange set of bit values.  Bear with us.)</p>
