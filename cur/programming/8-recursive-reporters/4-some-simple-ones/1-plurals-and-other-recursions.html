        <h2>Walking Down a List</h2>
        <div class="sidenote">It's a big simplification to say that adding "s" always forms the plural. If you did the optional project on Plurals and you like, you can use your work from the <code>plural</code> block you made in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/optional-projects/5-plurals2.html" title="Modeling Language: Plurals, Part 2">Unit 2</a>.</div>

		<p>
        	Here's the <code>plurals</code> block from Lab 1. It takes a <em>list of words</em> as input, and reports a list of the plurals of those words. Although there is a way to build this block using <code>map</code>, bear with us: there is a good reason to investigate this recursive version.<br />
        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/8-recursive-reporters/plurals.png" alt="plurals (words){if(empty?(words)){report(list{})}else{report(join(item(1) of (words) (s) in front of (plurals(all but first of(words))))}}" title="plurals (words){if(empty?(words)){report(list{})}else{report(join(item(1) of (words) (s) in front of (plurals(all but first of(words))))}}" />
        </p>
		<div class="takeNote">
            <p>The big idea here is that you can divide a list into its first item and all the rest of the items, form the plural of the first one, and make a recursive call for the rest. The <code>in front of</code> block may look strange at first, with its asymmetrical inputs (one item, one list), but it puts the plural of the first word and the plurals of the rest of the words back together.</p>
			<p>This pattern of code can be used to build many useful recursive reporters that have a simple base case and a simple recursive call.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <p><strong>Do the following exercises using recursion, not higher-order functions.</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <div class="sidenote">Try modifying the code from <code>plurals</code>.</div>Make a <code>squares</code> block that takes a list of numbers as input, and reports a list of the squares of the numbers.
                    <p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/8-recursive-reporters/squares-ex.png" alt="squares(list{7,8,1}) reporting {49,64,1}" title="squares(list{7,8,1}) reporting {49,64,1}" /></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make an <code>exaggerate</code> block that takes a sentence as input, and reports a sentence in which every number in the input is doubled, "good" is replaced by "great," "bad" is replaced by "terrible," "like" is replaced by "love," and "dislike" is replaced by "hate." 
                    <p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/8-recursive-reporters/ex-ex.png" alt="exaggerate(I ate 6 really good potstickers), reporting I ate 12 really great potstickers" title="exaggerate(I ate 6 really good potstickers), reporting I ate 12 really great potstickers" /></p>
                    <p>To do this, use a "wrapper" function that transforms the sentence into a list of words and back again:</p>
                    <p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/8-recursive-reporters/exaggerate.png" alt="exaggerate(sentence){report(list->sentence(exaggerate wordlist(sentence->list(sentence))))}" title="exaggerate(sentence){report(list->sentence(exaggerate wordlist(sentence->list(sentence))))}" /></p>
                    <div class="sidenote">What should the helper function do with the other words?</div>
                    <p>You'll also want a helper function <code>exaggerate word</code> that works on a single word, looking for specific words and types to exaggerate.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
