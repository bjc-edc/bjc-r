        <h2>Even Numbers and <code>Keep</code></h2>
        <p>We want a block that takes a list of numbers as input, and reports a list of just the <strong>even</strong> numbers from the input. </p>
        <p>
            You already know how to write this block using the <code>keep</code> higher-order function, but let's see what it looks like using recursion:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/evens.png" alt="evens" title="evens" />
        </p>
        <p>Here there are <em>three </em>possible cases to consider, not just the usual base case or recursive case. There's still a base case, namely an empty input list, in which case we report an empty list. But there are <em>two </em>recursive cases, depending on whether or not the first item of the list is even. (There has to be a first item, if we're not in the base case.) The green Operators blocks above take the remainder on dividing the first number by 2, and see if that remainder is 0, in which case the number is even.</p>
        <p>If the first number is even, then we want to include that number in the result. So we report that number <code>in front of</code> the recursive call on the rest of the numbers. If the first number isn't even, then we <em>don't </em>want to include it in the result, so we simply report the value reported by the recursive call.</p>
        
        <div class="takeNote">Like <code>plurals</code>, the <code>evens</code> code is an example of a <strong>pattern</strong> of code. There's nothing special about even numbers here. The same pattern could be used to make a list of odd numbers, or numbers that end in 7, or names that start with a Z.</div>
