        <h2>Sorting a List</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>PG: Scrap. Scrap all [in this lab]. Two reasons. (1) While sorting algorithms is an important and traditional CS topic, it's not obvious to me why they have any important role in an attract-them-in course. These are TiF for interested kids. (2) If our reason for this unit is to teach recursion, sorting is a distraction, and harder than we need to be. If anything at all, it's a culmination, not a start. I'd be happier showing kids how to march down a list and act on it. With HoFs or recursion. Power and utility. That's currently in Lab 4. Maybe earlier even than this unit?</p>

                    <strong>Design</strong> a <em>recursive</em> algorithm for sorting the names.
                    <ul>
                        <li>First consider your general strategy; how would <em>you</em> sort a group of names, step-by-step.</li>
                        <li>Then consider how you would tell <em>a computer</em>, which is not as smart as you and can only perform specific procedures, how to sort a list.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Now <strong>build</strong> your algorithm: a <code>sort</code> reporter takes a list as input and outputs a new list of the same elements in alphabetical order. Test your algorithm using both names and numbers.

                        Comparing numbers and strings can be done using the same blocks, so your sorting algorithm should work equally well for names and numbers.<br />

<p>There are many different algorithms to sort a list. Sorting algorithms give the same result, but the code and efficiency can vary greatly from one algorithm to another. The next two pages highlight two frequently used sorting algorithms.</p>

<!--


        <p>There are many different sorting algorithms. But the best one for recursively generated lists, and probably the most elegant, is called <em>mergesort. </em>Here's the idea in a nutshell: Divide the list in half; recursively sort each half; then merge the two sorted sublists. The base case is that an empty list or a one-item list is already sorted.</p>
        <p>The easiest way to divide a list in half turns out to be putting the odd-numbered items in one half and the even-numbered items in the other. You do this with a recursion that skips over an item each time:</p>
        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/odds.png" alt="odd items" /></p>
        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/evenitems.png" alt="even items" /></p>
        <p>All the work here, basically, is done by the <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/bfbf.png" alt="all but first of all but first of" /> in <code>odd numbered items</code>. This skips the second item and makes the recursive call on items 3 through the end of the list. Note that <code>even numbered items</code> is not <em>directly </em>recursive; it calls <code>odd numbered items</code>, not itself.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="4"><li>Why does <code>odd numbered items</code> need two base cases?</li>
                <li>Write a version of <code>even numbered items</code> that calls itself recursively instead of using <code>odd numbered items</code>.</li>
                <li>Can you write a version of <code>odd numbered items</code> that uses (the original) <code>even numbered items</code> instead of calling itself recursively? That program structure (A calls B, B calls A) is called <em><strong>mutual recursion</strong>.</em></li>
            </ol>
