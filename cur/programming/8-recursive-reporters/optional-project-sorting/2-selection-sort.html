        <h2>Selection Sort</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>PG: Scrap. Scrap all. Two reasons. (1) While sorting algorithms is an important and traditional CS topic, it's not obvious to me why they have any important role in an attract-them-in course. These are TiF for interested kids. (2) If our reason for this unit is to teach recursion, sorting is a distraction, and harder than we need to be. If anything at all, it's a culmination, not a start. I'd be happier showing kids how to march down a list and act on it. With HoFs or recursion. Power and utility. That's currently in Lab 4. Maybe earlier even than this unit?</p>
            <p>BH: Maybe insertion sort?  It's more useful.</p>
            <p>MF: I said keep, but I find these pages to be almost to much, and I want to review them.</p>

        <p>One of the most commonly used sorts is called a <strong>selection sort</strong>. Here's how it works:
            <ul>
                <li><div class="sidenote">The earliest item might be the first name in alphabetical order, or the smallest number in a list.</div><strong>Step 1.</strong> In an unsorted list, find a way to select the item that should come earliest in the sort.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Pull the selected item out of the list and place it in the first position.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> With the remaining items, use a selection sort to put them in order. If there are no remaining items, you're done.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <!--
        <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> With the remaining items, select the item that should come next in the sort.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Pull the item out of the list and place it.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5.</strong> Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until there is only one item left.</li> -->

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li> Explore the selection sort before writing any code. With your class, stand up and form a line. Then, follow the selection sort process to put everyone in sorted, alphabetical order by first name.</li>
                <li>How is a selection sort an example of recursion? What is the base case?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

<div class="todo">AC suggestion: give opportunity to write sort NOW instead of waiting until after the helper functions are developed. Leaving as is for now.</div>

        <p>To write a <code>selection sort</code> block in Snap<em>!</em>, you'll need code for a base case, and code that follows the steps of the selection sort.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="3">
                <li>
                    Write the <code>earliest in</code> block. For names, this returns the first name alphabetically in a list:<br />

                </li>
                <li>Write code that finds the <em>index</em> of the earliest item. This value is 8 for the list of names above. (You may not need this step, depending on your algorithm. See if you can do the next step without it.)</li>

        </div>

        <div class="takeNote">Like recursive commands, recursive reporters can feel like magic, because part of the code tells the recursive reporter to call itself. Recursive reporters work because each time, the new call gives a <em>smaller</em> input to the same reporter, eventually reaching a base case. After the base case is reached, the final result is built up piece by piece as each call reports a value to its caller.</div >

It turns out that capturing the data from the link given, importing and cleaning it is completely non-trivial and I don't think we have done this before in the curriculum.  I recommend we make the following (huge) <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/8-recursive-reporters/U8L2p2BabyNamesList.xml" target="_blank">starter file</a> available where the names are isolated and listed in popularity order, devoid of gender and number fields.  </div>
