        <p>
            Here is one solution for the <code>subsets</code> block:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/8-recursive-reporters/subset-slow.es.png" alt="subsets(set){if(empty?(set)){report(list{})}else{report(append(subsets(all but first of(set)))(map(item(1) of (set) in front of ()) over(subsets(all but first of(set)))))}}" title="subsets(set){if(empty?(set)){report(list{})}else{report(append(subsets(all but first of(set)))(map(item(1) of (set) in front of ()) over(subsets(all but first of(set)))))}}" />
        </p>

        <p>This solution should remind you of the <code>pascal</code> block you have seen in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/8-recursive-reporters/optional-project-pascals-triangle/2-pascal-efficiency.es.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F8-recursive-reporters.es.topic&course=bjc4nyc.es.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Pascal's Triangle and Efficiency">Unit 8 Lab 3 Page 2: Pascal's Triangle and Efficiency</a>, which makes two recursive calls and adds the results. The <code>pascal</code> block makes two recursive calls <em>with different inputs</em>. This version of <code>subsets</code> makes <em>the same</em> recursive call twice, an inefficiency that can be corrected.</p>
