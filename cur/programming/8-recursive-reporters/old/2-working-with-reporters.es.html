        <h2>Working with Recursive Reporters</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>PG: Drastic change, based on whatever we do with "counting branches" (not treesâ€”there's only one tree), this should change. The reporter is so special-purpose, whereas a n^m block is both /less/ complex (more straightforward) and /more/ generally useful, e.g., for counting the triangle's children.</p>
            <ul><li>I had written n^m into <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-making-computers-do-math/2-math-predicates.es.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.es.topic&course=bjc4nyc.es.html&novideo&noassignment">U2 Math Tools</a>, but it's now a primative. --MF, 4/5/19</li></ul>
        </div>

        <p>Here's Betty's code for the <code>segments in tree</code> function:</p>

        <div class="takeNote">The <code>report</code> block only connects to the blocks <em>above</em> it. That's because <code>report</code> returns the result of its input slot, immediately, as the output of the <code>segments in tree</code> reporter block. No further code is executed in a reporter after a <code>report</code> block.</div>
