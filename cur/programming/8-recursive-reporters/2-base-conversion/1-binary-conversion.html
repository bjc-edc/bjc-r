        <h2>Binary Conversion</h2>
        <div class="todo">
			<p>Brian's Notes from late July 2016: One of them tried decimal to binary conversion, and ended up bringing me a solution using an integer exponentiation function because he didn't see the hint about going from right to left.  Maybe we should make that more prominent?  (He'd gotten it working but felt that his solution was too complicated and wanted to know if there was an easier way.)  (7.3.3)</p>
			<p>PG: Do we love binary enough to keep this? I absolutely love the mathematics here. The hint page does really teach—and could be the basis for a lesson on recursion because it makes clear that one result is based on another—but it seems focused on getting /this task/ done, not on abstracting a general idea of recursion.  I think this is YADA (yet another distracting activity).</p>
            <p>BH: Number->binary.  And merge that hints page back in. (Mary agrees)</p>
			<p>Pages or lab needs renaming so they aren't duplicative. --MF, 6/15/20</p>
			<p>Brian wants to know, "Where's binary to number?" (inverse function) --MF, 7/6/20</p>
			<p>Add specs or the algorithm. --MF, 7/6/20</p>
			<p>The block should be renamed TO BINARY.  Its input is a number, not a character string. --Brian, 4/22/22</p>
			<p>We should discuss this (probably with Paul) before deciding on the change; whatever we decide to do, that change should be made together (you and I together) so that all instances are cleaned up and we aren't left with inconsistencies. --MF, 4/22/22</p>

In this project, you'll write a reporter <code>decimal-&gt;binary</code> that takes a <em>number</em> (which Snap<em>!</em> represents in decimal) as input, and reports a <em>string of zeros and ones</em> that represent the same number in binary:<br />

            To solve this problem, you'll need to work with integer division into a quotient and remainder. For example, 17 ÷ 5 is <strong>3</strong> with a <strong>remainder of 2</strong>. Here's how to find the quotient and remainder in Snap<em>!</em>&thinsp;:<br />
       		<div class="sidenote">To find <code>floor</code> you'll need the <code>sqrt</code> block, then change the operation. The <strong>floor</strong> of a number is the largest integer less than or equal to that number. The floor of &pi; is 3.</div>

        </p>
        
        <div class="todo">From AC: ask students to build the integer division block. BK: did not choose to do this because "floor" is very hard to locate. There are multiple methods to calculate the integer division, but the "floor" method is the most clear constant time method.</div>
