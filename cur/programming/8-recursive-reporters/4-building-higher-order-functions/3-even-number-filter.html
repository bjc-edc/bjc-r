        <h2>Even Numbers and <code>Keep</code></h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>PG: "We want a block that‚Ä¶."  Why?  I would SO hope that we have the time to write lessons like this (speaking rather loosely) where we actually DO "want a block that‚Ä¶" Earlier in the curriculum. FYTD 1, for example, could sensibly be applied much earlier. We can flat-out SHOW kids how to do it in one example, and let them modify (ahem, use, modify, create) it to do a different task, and then let them create their own. The FYTDs here are a bit like that, and are really good. Setting them in context would be great. Maybe before getting KEEP?</p>
            <p>BH: Move ITIT 5 to FYTD 4, old FYTD 4 to 5, so we can /end/ with the climactic orange box!</p>
            <p>MF: The pedagogy here is killing me. Here draw a square with recursion or functionally. WHY?!?!? Don't torture students. Give them a problem where this technique really matters.</p>

            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will build two other higher order functions you've learned in this course: <code>keep</code> and <code>combine</code>.</p>
        </div>

        <p>We want a block that takes a list of numbers as input, and reports a list of just the <strong>even</strong> numbers from the input. </p>
        <p>
            You already know how to write this block using the <code>keep</code> higher-order function, but here's what it looks like using recursion:<br />
            <div class="todo">Can we please come up with CS exercises that aren't "do this pointless thing to learn something that seemingly has no point"? There must be some reason we want to teach this--some context in which it would be useful; Let's show that. --MF, 9/26/18</div>

        </p>
        <p>Here there are <em>three </em>possible cases to consider, not just the usual base case and recursive case. There's still a base case, namely an empty input list, in which case we report an empty list. But there are <em>two </em>recursive cases, depending on whether or not the first item of the list is even. (There has to be a first item, if we're not in the base case.) The green Operators blocks above take the remainder on dividing the first number by 2, and see if that remainder is 0, in which case the number is even.</p>
        <p>If the first number is even, then we want to include that number in the result. So we report that number <code>in front of</code> the recursive call on the rest of the numbers. If the first number isn't even, then we <em>don't </em>want to include it in the result, so we simply report the value reported by the recursive call.</p>

        <div class="takeNote">Like <code>plurals</code>, the <code>evens</code> code is an example of a <strong>pattern</strong> of code. There's nothing special about even numbers here. The same pattern could be used to make a list of odd numbers, or numbers that end in 7, or names that start with a Z.</div>

			<p>Building <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code> is a major accomplishment. You've built a real gem of abstraction: higher-order functions, which treat a list as a single value. Some people don't even learn to <em>use</em> higher-order functions in college, let alone build them. üéâ Congratulations! üëè You've finished BJC! üèÜ</p>
