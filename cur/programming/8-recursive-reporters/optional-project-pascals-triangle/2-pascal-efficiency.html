        <p>As a first approximation, pretend that the computation would never reach a base case until row 0. Then a value in row 10 will make two recursive calls into row 9. Each of those will make two recursive calls, for a total of four into row 8. Each of <em>those</em> makes two recursive calls, so there are eight calls into row 7, 16 into row 6, 32 into row 5, 64 into row 4, 128 into row 3, 256 into row 2, 512 into row 1, and 1024 into row 0!</p>
        <p>In reality the situation isn't quite so bad, because by row 5 you're already hitting the ends of the row. But still, roughly speaking, it takes something like <span class="katex">2^n</span> recursive calls to find a value near the middle of row <span class="katex">n</span> of the triangle.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="4">
                <li>
                    Make a global variable called <code>count</code> and set it to 0. Modify your <code>pascal</code> script to keep count of recursive calls:
                    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/pascal-count.png" alt="pascal script with counter" /></p>
                    <p>How many calls are actually made when you compute <code>pascal(10,5)</code>? <code>pascal(12,6)</code>? (Don't forget to reset <code>count</code> to 0 for each experiment.) Make a guess for <code>pascal(14,7)</code> and see how close you come.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div> -->

        <p>Many of the recursive calls are redundant. For example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/8-recursive-reporters/pascal145.png" alt="pascal(14)(5)" title="pascal(14)(5)"/> will call <img src="/bjc-r/img/8-recursive-reporters/pascal103.png" alt="pascal(10)(3)" title="pascal(10)(3)" /> many times, asking for the same information.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Track what <img src="/bjc-r/img/8-recursive-reporters/pascal145.png" alt="pascal(14)(5)" title="pascal(14)(5)" /> actually calls to see the redundancy.</div>
