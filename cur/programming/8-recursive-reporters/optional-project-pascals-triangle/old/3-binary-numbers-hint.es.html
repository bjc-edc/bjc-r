        <h2>Hints for Binary Conversion</h2>

        <p>The biggest hint is that building the binary string should work from <strong>right to left</strong>, because the rightmost bit is always the ones column, while the leftmost bit's value changes depending on how many digits the numeral has.</p>
		
		<p>The following exercises are hints; use as many or few as you need. </p>
		<p>Remember, the <strong>input</strong> to your block is a <strong>number</strong>, so you  do arithmetic on it; the value <strong>reported</strong> by your block is a <strong>text string</strong>, so you need string operators (like <code>join</code>) to make it.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.es.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
          <ol>
                <div class="sidenote">Try doing these calculations by hand, and look for connections. The connections may help you understand how to write your code.</div>
                <li>Explain why 13 is 1101 in binary.</li>
				<li>Write 26 in binary. Write 27 in binary. How is each related to writing 13 in binary?</li>
				<li>What are the quotient and remainder when you divide 27 by 2?</li>

				            </ol>
</div >

                    Remember, you'll want to use the 
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/8-recursive-reporters/quotient.es.png" alt="(floor) of (17/5), reporting 3" title="(floor) of (17/5), reporting 3" /> and
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/8-recursive-reporters/mod.es.png" alt="(17)mod(5), reporting 2" title="(17)mod(5), reporting 2"/> blocks except that, for binary, you need a quotient and remainder when dividing by 2, not 5.
