        Using <a href="/bjc-r/prog/BYOB/phonebook.ypr">this framework</a>, practice using the hash table functions by building the phone book application mentioned above. You can load all of the data into it that you want, but your tool should allow a user to input someone's name and retrieve their phone number as many times as they like.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are several ways that you could design this application -- what is the best approach that you can think of? Build an application using the blocks below that loads a list of names and phone numbers and then allows a user to look up individual record listings as many times as they would like to.
