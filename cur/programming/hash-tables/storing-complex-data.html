The address book application that you just created can still perform quickly with thousands of people's information stored in it. <br><br>Are hash tables useful when you need to store more complex information, though? What if you wanted to store multiple pieces of information per key (name), such as multiple phone numbers for the same person? This is simple to do with hash tables as well!<br><br>Let's say you have to store the home phone number, work phone number, and cell phone number of each person in a list. Knowing how powerful hash tables can be, you would really like to use one to store all of this information. What do <strong>you</strong> think the best way to do this would be? Would your approach only work for phone numbers, or could it be used for many types of complex data?<br><br>Think about this for a moment -- this will be an important design decision for your search engine, but may be easier to think about in the context of a phone book. Make a note of your idea so that you can use it later in the lab.<br></body></html>
