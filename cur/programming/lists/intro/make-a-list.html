We are going to start working with lists!  Lists are a type of <strong>data structure</strong>, a particular way of storing data.  Many objects can be easily stored in a list, and so lists have become a very useful and ubiquitous data structure in computer science.  For example, if we are developing a game and we want to keep track of the people that have played our game, we might keep their names in a list.

<br><br>

As with anything new, the first thing to do is explore!  Make a new list named <code>players</code> by clicking on the button <code>Make a list</code>, as shown below.

<br><br>

Below the name of your new list, you will see a bunch of blocks that operate on lists.  With your partner, use the <code>players</code> list to experiment with these blocks, and determine what these blocks do before going on to the next step.

<br><br><strong>Important note</strong>: In today's lab, and in the labs to come, we will be making a lot of scripts that will be used later.  Please be sure to perform each exercise in a different file, and store these files safely in your account.  Since you will be programming in pairs, one of you can e-mail the files to the other to ensure that both of you have the files.   </body></html>
