			Suppose I have a global variable named <code>
				foo</code>
			, and I define the following two blocks:
		</p>
		<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/list/add5foo.png" alt="add 5 to foo" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="/bjc-r/img/list/add20any.png" alt="add 20 to (var)" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Now I run the following script:
		</p>
		<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/list/addscript.png" alt="call both blocks" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Will the final value of foo be 100? 105? 120? or 125? Try it and see.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			Now do the following similar experiment, but with a list as the value of <code>
				foo</code>
			:
		</p>
		<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/list/append5foo.png" alt="append 5 to foo" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="/bjc-r/img/list/append20var.png" alt="append 20 to (var)" />
		</p>
		<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/list/appendscript.png" alt="call both append blocks" />
		</p>
		<p>
			What items will be in <code>
				foo</code>
			after running this script?
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			Why do these two experiments give different results?
		</p>
		<p>
			It's not surprising that the two blocks that specifically change the global variable <code>
				foo</code>
			succeed. But how come you can add a new item to a list passed into a block as input, whereas you can't change a numeric variable passed in as input?
		</p>
		<p>
			Snap<em>!</em> is actually behaving consistently in these two cases. To understand why, you have to keep clear in your mind the difference between a <em>value</em>&ndash;a number, text string, Boolean (true/false), or list&ndash;and a <em>variable,</em> which is essentially a connection between a name and a value. (This is not precisely the definition of &quot;variable&quot; you'd learn in a programming language design course, but it's  close enough until you have to implement a programming language yourself.)
		</p>
		<p>
			As in most programming languages, the inputs you provide to a block in a Snap<em>!</em> program are <em>values. </em>The block doesn't know how the value was provided: typed directly into an input slot, computed by a reporter dragged into the slot, or taken from a variable dragged into the slot.
		</p>
		<p>
			If that went over your head because it's too abstract, consider this script:
		</p>
		<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/list/addfoo+3.png" alt="add 20 to (foo+3)" />
		</p>
		<p>
			You wouldn't expect <em>that</em> to change the value of <code>
				foo</code>
			to&mdash; To what? 123? 117? It just doesn't make sense to expect this to change <code>
				foo</code>
			at all. The input to the <code>
				add 20 to</code>
			block is the number 103&ndash;the <em>value</em> of <img src="/bjc-r/img/list/foo+3.png" alt="foo+3" />&ndash;not the variable. The same is true in the original experiment; the input to <code>
				add 20 to</code>
			is the number 105 (because the <code>
				add 5 to foo</code>
			block specifically changed <code>
				foo</code>
			), not the variable <code>
				foo</code>
			itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <code>
				change</code>
			block in the definition of <code>
				add 20 to</code>
			does change a variable: the variable it says it changes, namely <code>
				var</code>
			. That variable is local to the block's defining script, so changing it doesn't affect the rest of the program at all. Local variables are temporary; when the block finishes, the variable is gone.
		</p>
		<p>
			What if the value of <code>
				foo</code>
			is a list? Unlike numbers, lists themselves are mutable. (<em>Variables</em> are mutable, too, which is why we're having this discussion, but only when the variable name itself appears in a <code>
				set</code>
			or <code>
				change</code>
			block.) After the two <code>
				append</code>
			blocks in the second experiment are run, the value associated with variable <code>
				foo</code>
			is <em>the same list </em>as it was before. But that list now has more elements. We say that it &quot;maintains its identity&quot; even though its contents have changed.
