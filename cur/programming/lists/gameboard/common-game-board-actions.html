<h2>Exercises</h2> This homework exercise deals with <a href="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/mod/resource/view.php?id=1783">the game board implementation</a> that you created earlier in the lab. Now that we can set pieces in a game board and get pieces from a game board, we can code the following blocks that perform common actions on game boards:
<ul><li><em>Swap</em>: swaps the values at two locations.</li>
  <li><em>Move</em>: moves the value from one location to another and leaves a blank <code>B</code> in the first location.</li>
  <li><em>Remove</em>: replaces the value with a blank (<code>B</code>).</li>
  <li><em>Drop in column</em>: drops a piece into a column, and works like the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">Connect Four</a>, where you can drop a piece into a column. The piece will stop one spot above the first piece it finds. Check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">Wikipedia page for Connect 4</a> to see a picture of this. (<em>Note</em>: It can be a little weird to think about a "column" in a list. We can picture a row as a list item, and a column as the values that are a certain number of spots away from the first values of each row.)</li>
</ul> The image below specifies the corresponding blocks and their input types, where <code>game board</code> is a list representing a game board. <br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/game-board-moves-BYOB.jpg" alt="game moves" title="game moves" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab06/GameMoves.jpg"><br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/drop-x-in-column-block-BYOB.gif" alt="drop" title="drop" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab06/drop.gif"></div> <br> For homework, you should implement these blocks. Also, implement error-checking to ensure that the inputs to the blocks are valid. If the user provides invalid inputs to any of the command blocks, then that block should do nothing. For example, if the user were to provide a location to the <code>Move</code> block that lay beyond the boundaries of the game board, then the block should do nothing.    </body></html>
