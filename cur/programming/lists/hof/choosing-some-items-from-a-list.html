<p><br>You've probably played Geography, the game in which one player says 
a place name and the next player has to name another place whose first 
letter is the last letter of the previous place: Newark, Kentucky, 
Yonkers, San Francisco, Oklahoma. Have you ever gotten stuck on the 
letter "A"? Oklahoma, Alabama, Asia, Alaska, America, Alameda... and so 
on, forever.</p>
How many states start and end with the same letter? To find out, we first need a list of all the states:<br>
<img title="Alabama, Alaska, ... Wisconsin, Wyoming" alt="Alabama, Alaska, ... Wisconsin, Wyoming" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/states.png" border="0"/>

<p>Now we want to select a subset of the states, namely the ones whose 
first and last letters are the same. Here's the block we use for that:<br>
<img title="KEEP ITEMS SUCH THAT (&lt;predicate&gt;) FROM (list)" alt="KEEP ITEMS SUCH THAT (&lt;predicate&gt;) FROM (list)" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/keepblock.png" border="0"/>

<p>Like <code>map</code>, the <code>keep</code> block has a function as its first input. 
Notice, though, that this grey ring's inner boundary is hexagonal. 
This lets you know that you should use a <i>predicate </i>function, 
which means a function that reports <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.

</p>We want to know whether two things are equal:<br>
<img title="&lt;&lt; &gt; = &lt; &gt;&gt;" alt="&lt;&lt; &gt; = &lt; &gt;&gt;" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/equalblock.png" border="0"/>

<p>The first letter of a word is letter number 1:<br>
<img title="(LETTER (1) OF [])" alt="(LETTER (1) OF [])" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/firstletterblock.png" border="0"><br>
(Note that we've deleted the word "world" that <span class="snap">snap</span>  provides as a default 
value, a hint about what kind of input is expected. The input slot must 
be empty for our function-input notation to work.)

</p>
<p>Finding the last letter is a little trickier; you find the length of 
  the text and use that number to select which letter you want:<br>
  <img title="(LETTER (LENGTH OF []) OF [])" alt="(LETTER (LENGTH OF []) OF [])" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/lastletterblock.png" border="0"/>
  
  </p>
<p>
  </p>
  Putting all these pieces together will give us the answer we want:<br>
  <img title="KEEP ITEMS SUCH THAT (&lt;...&gt;) FROM (STATES)" alt="KEEP ITEMS SUCH THAT (&lt;...&gt;) FROM (STATES)" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/geography.png" border="0"/>
  <br>You can see from the "length: 4" in the result that there are four such states. The one you can't see in this picture is Ohio.
  
</p>
<p><br>But if you're playing Geography, the question you really want answered is 
"Which states start with such-and-such a letter?" You can define a block
 that takes a letter as input and gives the answer to that question:<br>
<img title="report (keep...) ..." alt="report (keep...) ..." src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/state-starting.png" border="0"></p>
<img title="states with P -&gt; pennsylvania" alt="states with P -&gt; pennsylvania" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/p-states.png" border="0"><p>
<img title="states with S -&gt; south carolina, south dakota" alt="states with S -&gt; south carolina, south dakota" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/s-states.png" border="0"/>

<p><br><br><b>Try this: </b>
<p>Write an expression that will select all the words of at least 
  five letters from a list. For example, if the words in the list are <code>being</code>, 
  <code>for</code>, <code>the</code>, <code>benefit</code>, <code>of</code>, <code>mister</code>, and <b><code>kite</code></b>, 
  then your block should choose the words <code>being</code>, <code>benefit</code>, and <code>mister</code>.
<p>Write an expression that takes a list of mixed words and numbers, and selects just the numbers, 
  (Hint: Look for <code>is</code> in the Operators palette.)
<p>Write an expression that selects from a list of words the ones that start with a vowel. 
  (Hint: Use <code>contains</code> in the Variables palette.)<br><br>
