<title>Make the Game Interactive</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>At last you're ready to make this a real, interactive
  game. Then, if you're still game, you can improve the strategy.</p>
<p>First, be sure you've turned in your work so far.</p>
<p><em>This page and the next are optional! </em>But you really should find it all within your ability by now.</p>
<hr />
<p>We're just going to sketch out a structure, not go through it in detail.</p>
<p>1. Ask the user if s/he wants to play first (X) or second (O).</p>
<p>2. Draw the board on the stage.</p>
<p>3. If the computer is going first, move in square 5.</p>
<p>4. Then comes a <code>forever</code> loop:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>a. If there are no free squares, declare a tie and stop.</p>
  <p>b.Tell the user to move, and detect a mouse click in one of the squares as the move.</p>
  <p>c. Update the position.</p>
  <p>d. If the user has won, say so and stop.</p>
  <p>e. Use the <code>ttt</code> block to choose the computer's move.</p>
  <p>f. Update the position.</p>
  <p>g. If the computer has won, say so and stop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's it. You'll want to write helpers such as <code>draw-x</code> and <code>draw-o</code> that take a square number as input and draw two crossed lines or a circle on the stage in the right place, and <code>tie?</code> and <code>winner?</code> to handle steps 4a, 4d, and 4g.</p>
