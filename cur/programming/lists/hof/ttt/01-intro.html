<h3> Introduction </h3>
Now that you've learned about higher order functions (HOFs), we're going  to use them for a larger example. You are going to make a program that  plays a decent game of tic-tac-toe. First of all, you should understand how a mid-game tic-tac-toe board will be represented in the project, as a list of what's in each of the nine squares.
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/tic-tac-toe-board.png" alt="tic-tac-toe board" /></p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p> We will represent the board as a list whose items are in the order of the numbers above. In this sample board the first item is an underline (which represents a blank  square to make the list more human-readable), and the second item is a O. We will call this the <em>position.</em> (We'll see shortly that our program will also use a second representation of the board that's easier for the program to manipulate.)<br />
</p>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/ttt-position.png" alt="position as list" /></p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>The program will allow a human user to play against the computer. Your goal in this project is to write a block, <code>ttt</code>, that will determine the computer's next move based on the current position. (Tic-tac-toe isn't a very challenging game, for people, but as a first game-strategy project it's just right.)</p>
<p>The  <code>ttt</code> block will  report the computer's next move given the current configuration. It  takes two inputs: the current position and whether the computer is  playing X or O. If the computer is X and using the board above, we can  use the <code>ttt</code> block like this: </p>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/ttt-sample-call.png" alt="ttt sample call" /><br />
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <div>
    <p>So the computer will move in the first square, which makes sense.<br />
