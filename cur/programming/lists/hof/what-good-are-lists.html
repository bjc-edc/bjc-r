  <p>What can be in a list? Just about anything. Lists of numbers can track grades [sidenotes here would be useful] or represent a sprite's position as a single vector (two-term list) containing the x- and y-position numbers. Lists of words can be family members or an entire dictionary. You can even use <i>lists of lists</i> for more complicated data structures:</p>
  <p><img border="0" title="List of the list John and Lennon, the list Paul and McCartney, etc." alt="List of the list John and Lennon, the list Paul and McCartney, etc." src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/Beatles.png" /><br><br>
  </p>

  <p><br><br><b>Building Sentences</b></p>

<p><br>
  Let's write a program to generate English sentences. Your starting point might be various lists of words:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/wordlists.png" alt="lists of nouns, verbs, etc." title="lists of nouns, verbs, etc." /></p>
<p>You could build up a sentence out of phrases. For example, to make a noun phrase, you want to pick one item from the <code>articles</code> list, one from the <code>adjectives</code> list, and one from the <code>nouns</code> list.
  
  </p>
  To select one item from a list, use the <code>item</code> block:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/itemblock.png" alt="ITEM (n) OF (list)" title="ITEM (n) OF (list)" />
</p>
<p>List items are numbered from 1, so, for example, item 3 of the <code>nouns</code> list above is <code>pizza</code>. The first input slot accepts a number like other rounded input slots, but it also has a downward arrow that, when clicked, offers two special choices: <code>last</code> for the last item of the list, and <code>any</code> to pick an item at random.
<p>The second input slot in the <code>item</code> block is something you haven't seen before: a rectangle with two orange smaller rectangles inside it. Just as a rounded input slot indicates that a number is expected, and a hexagonal input slot indicates that a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> value is expected, this new kind of input slot means that a list value is expected. It's meant to look like what you see when you <b><code>say</code></b> a list: a grey (rounded) rectangle with red-orange rectangles for the individual items.
  <p>To make a random phrase, use the <code>item any</code> feature and choose a random article, a random adjective, and a random noun.</p>
  <p><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/nounphrase-block.png" alt="Noun phrase block, JOIN WORDS of an item from each of ARTICLES, ADJECTIVES, and NOUNS" title="Noun phrase block, JOIN WORDS of an item from each of ARTICLES, ADJECTIVES, and NOUNS" />
  </p>
  <p>The <code>join words</code> block adds spaces between strings. Because of the random item choices, we get a different result each time we call <code>noun phrase</code>:</p>
  <p><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/nouphrase-calls.png" alt="the little elephant, a red aardvark, etc." title="the little elephant, a red aardvark, etc." />
    
  </p>
  <p><br><br><b>For You To Do</b></p>
  <p>Create blocks <code>prepositional phrase</code>, <code>verb phrase</code>, and others like it, ending with a <code>sentence</code> block that reports sentences like &quot;the little elephant runs excitedly around the big pizza.&quot; Can you improve on this so that the sentence structure varies, sometimes including people's names instead of article-adjective-noun phrases, or different sentence structures? Post your work when you have something to share!
