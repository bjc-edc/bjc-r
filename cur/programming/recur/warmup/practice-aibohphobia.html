This time, we are going to use recursion to determine whether a word is a <span style="font-style: italic;">palindrome.</span><br>A palindrome is a word or number that is identical when read both forwards and backwards. Most definitions of a palindrome ignore all punctuation, so we will be doing that in our exercise today as well. Some simple palindromes include "kayak," "radar," and "dad," although sentences, poems, and stories can be palindromic as well. For a more complete list, check out <a href="http://www.palindromelist.net/">http://www.palindromelist.net/</a>.<br><h2>Exercise</h2>Create a reporter block that has a single argument (a phrase) and returns either true (if the phrase is a palindrome) or false (if the phrase is not a palindrome).  Use this block to construct another block that makes Alonzo say one of two things, depending on whether or not the phrase is a palindrome: <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" title="Palindromes" alt="Palindromes" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/palindromes-speaking.png" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/palindromes.png"><br></div><br>There is more than one way to solve this problem, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but try to accomplish it using recursion</span>. You may want to consider writing a helper block or two to simplify the problem, such as the following (some parts left out):<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" title="Substring in BYOB" alt="Substring in BYOB" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/substring-code-template-BYOB.gif" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab14/substring-template.gif"><br></div><br></body></html>
