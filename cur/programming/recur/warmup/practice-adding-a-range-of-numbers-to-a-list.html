        Lists have an almost unlimited variety of uses and allow us to do a number of things that we could not do otherwise.  When dealing with mathematical problems, we can often use lists as "memory" to keep track of numbers that are possible solutions to a problem.  A typical example of this sort of situation would involve loading all of the initial possibilities into a list (for example, all of the positive numbers from 1 to 50) and removing items as they are found to be invalid (possibly the numbers that are not evenly divisible by 5, for example).  We can continue to remove numbers from the list of possibilities until all of the restrictions have been enforced, leaving only the solutions to the problem in the list.

        Write a recursive block that will add all of the numbers between <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> (inclusive) to a list.  It should be possible to specify the values of <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> as parameters to the block, as well as the name of the list that should be affected.
