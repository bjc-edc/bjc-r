        <p>
            After completing the previous exercise you should be able to generate lists of numbers to use for a variety of purposes.
            Use the block you created in <a href="practice-adding-a-range-of-numbers-to-a-list.html" target="_blank">the previous exercise</a>
            to test each of these blocks on a variety of numbers.
        </p>
        <p>

            Create two new recursive blocks.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The first block should remove all numbers below a certain threshold in a list. The block should accept the list and the threshold value as parameters.
            </li>
            <li>
                The second block should reverse the order of all of the elements in a list. The block should accept the list as a parameter.
            </li>
        </ul>
