<p>Before you actually solve this problem, we have to make a slight detour to explain a notation we haven't used before.</p>
<p>You're going to want to nest one higher order function call inside another:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/mapmap.png" alt="map of map" /></p>
<p>Inside the inner ring, there are two things an empty box might mean: an item from the inner list or an item from the outer list. For example, you want to find all the possible sums of numbers, one from each of two lists:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/mapsum.png" alt="map of map of +" /></p>
<p>Your intention here is that the left input of <code>+</code> should be one of 2, 3, or 4; the right input should be one of 50 or 60. But Snap<em>! </em>can't read your mind. What actually happens is that the inner <code>map</code> call puts one of 2, 3, or 4 into <em>both </em>empty input slots, so the only numbers in the result are 4, 6, and 8 (2+2, 3+3, and 4+4).</p>
<p>In this situation you need a way to <em>name</em> the inputs to the two ringed functions. If you click the right arrow at the end of a ring, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/mapinput.png" alt="map with input name" /></p>
<p>The orange oval works just like a variable in a <code>script variables</code> block; you can change its name by clicking on it, and you can drag it into the function inside the ring. Now you can nest <code>map</code> blocks and be explicit about which value goes where:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/mapsum-formal.png" alt="map of map of + with input names" /></p>
<p>The result is a list of lists, rather than a list of six numbers, but at least they're the right numbers! Flattening the result is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>The technical term for a function's input names is its <em>formal parameters, </em>or sometimes just &quot;parameters.&quot;</p>
