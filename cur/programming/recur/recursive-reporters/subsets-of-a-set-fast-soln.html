<p>With our original solution:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/subset-slow.png" alt="slow solution" /></p>
<p>it takes 127 calls to find the 64 subsets of a six-element set. Here's how to make the recursive calls only once:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/subset-fast.png" alt="fast solution" /></p>
<p>This version takes only 7 calls to find the 64 subsets! That's quite an improvement.</p>
<p>In general, for an <em>n</em>-element list, the first version makes about 2<sup><em>n</em>+1</sup> calls; the second takes just <em>n</em>+1 calls.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>â˜ž Optional Challenge Activity: Measure the time in seconds that it takes for an eight-element list with both versions. Is the actual time speedup as dramatic as the improvement in the number of calls? Why or why not? (How long does each call to <code>map</code> take?)</p>
