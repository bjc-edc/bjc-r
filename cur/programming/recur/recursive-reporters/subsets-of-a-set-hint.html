<title>Subset hints</title>

<body>
<p>☞ How many subsets does the empty set {} have?</p>
<p>☞ So what should <code>subsets</code> report in the base case? This is the hardest part to get right!</p>
<p>☞ How many subsets of {Apple, Orange, Banana} contain Apple? How many don't?</p>
<p>☞ Is there another way to describe &quot;the subsets of {Apple, Orange, Banana} that don't contain Apple&quot;?</p>
<p>☞ In the Snap<em>!</em> file menu, choose &quot;Libraries...&quot; at the bottom, then choose &quot;List Utilities.&quot; You'll find the <code>append</code> block in that library helpful.</p>
<p>☞ Now write the <code>subsets</code> block. Ask for help if you get stuck.</p>
