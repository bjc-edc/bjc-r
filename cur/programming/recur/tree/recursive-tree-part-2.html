			4. That <code>tree2a</code> block is pretty long and repetitive. But we can simplify it if we notice that in two places it has a move forward/move back pair of blocks, and that this is what <code>tree1</code> does! So we can use <code>tree1</code> to shorten <code>tree2</code>. Compare the code below to convince yourself that the new <code>tree2</code> will work the same as the original <code>tree2a</code>. <br>

		Note that the tree blocks inside this <code>tree2</code> script are <code>tree1</code> blocks, not <code>tree2</code> blocks! So there's no mysterious <code>tree</code>-using-<code>tree</code> situation here; it's not unusual for one already-written block to be used in <em>another</em> block's script. </p>
		<p>
		5. Make a <code>tree3</code> block that uses the <code>tree2</code> block, on the same pattern, and see if you get the result that you expect. </p>
		<p>
		6. If you can stand it, make a <code>tree4</code> block that uses the <code>tree3</code> block and try it out. </p>
		<p>
			<b>This would be a good time to save your project.</b>

		7. These blocks all look exactly the same, don't they? So it makes sense to wonder if we can't replace them all with a single <code>tree</code> block. Here's the big idea: We can write a <code>tree</code> block that uses itself in its own script <i>provided that it knows how many levels it's expected to draw!</i> So, in addition to the size input, it'll have a <code>levels</code> input: </p>
		<p>
		In the earlier steps, <code>tree3</code> used <code>tree2</code>; <code>tree2</code> used <code>tree1</code>. If you actually had the patience to work up to a <code>tree437</code> block, what block would it call for its two branches? To generalize the pattern, <code>tree</code> will use <code>tree</code>, but reducing the number of levels by 1:</p>
