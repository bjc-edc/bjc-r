			Now let's consider a slightly more complicated block that makes use of a loop.  
			It accepts two numbers as inputs (<code>start</code> and <code>end</code>) 
			and finds the sum of all of the numbers in the range from <code>start</code> to <code>end</code>, inclusive.</p>

		<img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/sum-of-numbers-between-8-and-10.gif" />
		<p>
			When <code>start = 8</code> and <code>end = 10</code>, the value reported by this function will be <code>27</code> (8+9+10).  
			How do you think you'd make this block?  Try building it and see if you can make it work.</p>
