            Repeating a part of your program is a very common
            practice in programming.  We'll call this <em>looping</em>,
            and there many different blocks you can use to do it
            in many different ways.
        </p>
        <p class="alert quoteBlue">
            The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png"> block is
            appropriate if you want to repeat the same behavior for... ever.
            <br>
            <br>
            The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png"> block is
            great if you want to loop
            the same behavior a certain number of times.
        </p>
        Sometimes, though, you want to do <em>almost</em> the
        same thing for a certain number of times, but with a slight variation.
        For instance:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You  want to draw 20 squares on the screen, but each a different size.
            </li>
            <li>
                You  want to draw 100 polygons with different numbers of sides.
            </li>
            <!-- any more here, yo? -->
        </ul>

        <p>
            Many such situations can be handled by the <code>for</code>
            block near the bottom of the Control palette:
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/for.png" alt="for">
        </p>

        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            NOTE: in the current version of <span class="snap">snap</span>, the <code>for</code> block isn't installed automatically.
            You will need to import it once for each new <span class="snap">snap</span> project in which you use it. To do so,
            click on the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-file-menu.png"> icon at the top of the screen and select <code>Import Tools</code>.)
