David is best known for his work on wireless enabled devices. He is one of the early inventors of the wireless ad hoc networks, a temporary decentralized type of wireless network that enables all mobile phones to work today. His inventions were also a driving force behind the development of what is now known as the "Smart Grid" which monitors and harnesses the power of wireless-enabled devices at a specific location.</p>			<!--<p><a href="" title="" target="_blank"></a></p>-->		</div><div class="atwork"> <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/atwork.en.html">4.2.4</a>				<div class="imageRight">					<img class="noshadow" height="200px" src="/bjc-r/img/atwork/Luis_von_Ahn.jpg" alt="photo of Luis von Ahn" title="photo of Luis von Ahn">					<div class="endnote" style="width:141px;margin:6px;"><small>Image from Wikimedia user <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:EneasMx" title="Wikimedia user EneasMx" target="_blank">EneasMx</a></small></div>				</div>				<p>Luis von Ahn (born in 1978), one of the pioneers of crowdsourcing, is a Guatemalan entrepreneur with a PhD in computer science.
