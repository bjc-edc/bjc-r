David is best known for his work on wireless enabled devices. He is one of the early inventors of the wireless ad hoc networks, a temporary decentralized type of wireless network that enables all mobile phones to work today. His inventions were also a driving force behind the development of what is now known as the "Smart Grid" which monitors and harnesses the power of wireless-enabled devices at a specific location.</p>			<!--<p><a href="" title="" target="_blank"></a></p>-->		</div><div class="atwork"> <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/atwork.en.html">4.1.3</a>				<div class="imageRight">					<img class="noshadow" height="200px" src="/bjc-r/img/atwork/Vint_Cert.jpeg" alt="photo of Vint Cert" title="photo of Vint Cert">				</div>				<p>Vint Cerf (born 1943) is an American Internet pioneer and is recognized as one of "the fathers of the Internet."
