			The sprite occupies a position (x,y) on the stage where x represents the horizontal position, from -240 (left) to 240 (right), and y represents the vertical position, from -180 (bottom) to 180 (top). Here's a picture:

			The black sprite is at the center of the stage, called the <em>origin, </em>with coordinates (0, 0).
			The green sprite is to the right of the origin, so its x position is positive; it's below the origin,
			so its y position is negative. Each grid line above represents 20 steps, so the green sprite's coordinates are (140, -100).
			 Take some time to make sure you understand this, discussing it with your partner or classmate.

			What are the coordinates of the red sprite?

			The next lesson asks you to move a random character around the stage within certain boundaries. Keep in mind the coordinate system shown above.
