        <p>
            After a while, you'll notice that your randomly moving sprite will move off the screen.  Add to your script
            so that the sprite stays <i>mostly</i> within 100 pixels of the center of the screen&mdash;that is, in a 200 by 200
            square.  (It turns out that it is hard to ensure, using the motion blocks <code>turn</code> and <code>move _ steps</code>,
            that the sprite stays <i>strictly</i> within a 200 by 200 pixel square.  For this activity, if the sprite heads out
            in one step, you'll need to ensure that it doesn't go further out on subsequent steps).
        </p>
        <p>
            You can do using an <code>if</code> block, and will find the the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/x-position.png" alt="x position block" />, 
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/y-position.png" alt="y position block" />, and 
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/direction.png" alt="direction block" /> reporter blocks useful.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a first task, make sure your character (mostly) doesn't go below the <code>y = -100</code> line&mdash;that
            is, doesn't have a <code>y position</code> less than <code>-100</code>.
            If the sprite is below the <code>y = -100</code> line, it should not go any lower.
            That is, don't allow any directions that are between 90 and 180 degrees.  (If you
            are using negative numbers for direction, you'll need to check for additional
            values!)
        </p>
        <p>
            If your find that your sprite is too low <b>and</b> will go lower on the current move, you can
            either:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                simply not move this step, and have the sprite choose a new, random direction
                on the next step.
            </li>
            <li>
                use a turn statement to fix the direction, by flipping it so it points upward.</i>

        </ul>
        <p>
            Test your solution long enough to ensure that your sprite
            won't go below the <code>y = -100</code> line&mdash;or, won't continue once a move
            takes it below.  One trick that might speed up testing: drag your sprite below
            the <code>y=-100</code> line, and see if it only moves upwards.

            To additionally help your testing, consider drawing a red 200 pixel by 200 pixel box on the screen, so you
            can see if your sprite crosses it.
        </p>
        <img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/draw-a-red-200x200-box.png"
        alt="draw a red 200 by 200 box" />
        </p>

        <p>
            You'll need to handle the other three directions as well:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>
                If the sprite is above the <code>y = 100</code> line, it should not go any higher.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the sprite is to the left of the <code>x = -100</code> line, it should not go any farther left.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the sprite is to the right of the <code>x = 100</code> line, it should not go any farther right.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
