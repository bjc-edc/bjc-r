<h2>Recursive Reporters</h2>
<p>Until this unit, all our examples of recursion have been
    <em>command</em> blocks, whose scripts have a structure like this:</p>
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursive-reporters/rec-command.png" alt="recursive command pattern" /></p>
    <p>There can be any number of recursive calls interspersed with other commands in the script.</p>
	<p>Reporters are different, because a reporter can only report <em>one </em>value. So you can't do this:</p>
   
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursive-reporters/bad-rec-reporter.png" alt="bad (multi-report) recursive reporter pattern" /></p>
<div class="sidenote"><p>Take It Further:<br />How did we make that picture?</p></div>    <p>(In fact, Snap<em>!</em> won't let you stack <code>report</code> blocks; since <code>report</code> ends the script, there is no connection tab below the block and you can't put anything directly below it.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Instead, most of the time a recursive reporter call will be inside a <em>combiner</em> that attaches the result of the recursive call to some other value:</p>
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursive-reporters/rec-reporter.png" alt="correct recursive reporter pattern with combiner" /></p>
    <p>The combiner can be an arithmetic operator such as <code>+</code> or <code>&times;</code>:</p>
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursive-reporters/factorial.png" alt="factorial" /></p>
     <div class="forYouToDo" id="first"><ol><li>Make a <code>sum</code> block that takes a list of numbers as input and reports their sum.</li></ol></div>
    <p>... or a text string operator such as <code>join</code> or <code>join words</code>:</p>
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursive-reporters/list-to-sentence.png" alt="list-&gt;sentence" /></p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
        	<ol start="2"><li>Make an <code>initials</code> block that takes a list of words as input and reports a word containing the first letters of each of the input words.</li></ol></div>
    <p>or a list operator such as <code>append</code> or <code>in front of</code>:</p>
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursive-reporters/plurals.png" alt="plurals" /></p>
	<div class="forYouToDo">
       <p>Don't go on until you understand what those three example scripts do, and how they do it. </p></div>
	<p class="takeNote">Note: On rare occasions, the recursive call <em>does</em> appear directly inside the <code>report</code>:<br />
    <img src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursive-reporters/piglatin.png" alt="piglatin" /><br />
    But almost always, you won't go wrong if you start by thinking about what combining block to use.</p>
