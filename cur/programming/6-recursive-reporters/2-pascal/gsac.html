<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<p>You're in a class with a total of five students: Rocky, Bullwinkle, Peabody, Sherman, and <u>(your name here)</u>. You want to choose a committee to get the refreshments for the class party.  Remember that "Rocky and Sherman" is the same committee as "Sherman and Rocky."</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol type="a">
<li>How many different committees of three people include Bullwinkle?</li>


  <li>How many different committees of three people <em>don't</em> include Bullwinkle?</li>
  <div>
    <div class="sidenote">Some people call this the &quot;distinguished member method.&quot;  </div>
  </div>

<li>How many different committees of three people are there <em>altogether</em> in a group of five students?</li>
</ol>
<!-- <div><div class="sidenote">One idea:  use the result of problem~\ref{fipro} and the distinguished member method.</div></div> -->
<li>How many 3-person committees can you make from 6 students?  See if you can use the results from earlier questions to help answer this one.</li>

<li>
<ol type="a">
<li>How many 1-member committees can you form from 100 students?</li>
<li>How many 99-member committees can you form from 100 students?</li>
<li>How many 100-member committees can you form from 100 students?</li>
<div><div class="sidenote">How can you have a committee with~0 members?  Find a way for that to make sense.</div></div>
<li>How many 0-member committees can you make from 100 students?  </li>
</ol>
<hr /> 
<li>How did you solve question 10? Describe your method in words, so precisely that others in your class understand it.


</li>
<li><strong>Take it Further</strong>.  Here's a start on a reporter that will return the number of $k$-person committees that can be formed from $n$-students.

<p>Finish it off.</p></li>
