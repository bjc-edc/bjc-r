<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<p>You're in a class with a total of five students: Rocky, Bullwinkle, Peabody, Sherman, and <u>(your name here)</u>. You want to choose a committee to get the refreshments for the class party.  Remember that "Rocky and Sherman" is the same committee as "Sherman and Rocky."</p>
<ol>
<li>How many different committees of three people include Bullwinkle?</li>
<li>If a committee of three people includes Bullwinkle, how many <em>more</em> people are on the committee?</li>
<li>If a committee of three people includes Bullwinkle, how many other students (besides Bullwinkle) are eligible to be on the committee?</li>
<li>How many committees of two people could you make from a class of four students?</li>
<hr />
<li>How many different committees of three people <em>don't</em> include Bullwinkle?</li>
<!-- <div><div class="sidenote">Some people call this the ``distinguished member method.''   Bullwinkle is the distinguished member.  You count all the committees that contain Bullwinkle, then count all the committees that don't, and then ... .</div></div>  -->
<li>If a committee doesn't include Bullwinkle, how many students are eligible to be on it?</li>
<li>How many committees of three people could you make from a class of four students?</li>
<hr />
<li>How many different committees of three people are there <em>altogether</em> in a group of five students?</li>
<li>How many 2-person committees can you make from 5 students??</li>
<!-- <div><div class="sidenote">One idea:  use the result of problem~\ref{fipro} and the distinguished member method.</div></div> -->
<li>How many 3-person committees can you make from 6 students?  See if you can use the results from earlier questions to help answer this one.</li>
<hr />
<li>How many 1-member committees can you form from 100 students?</li>
<li>How many 99-member committees can you form from 100 students?</li>
<li>How many 100-member committees can you form from 100 students?</li>
<!-- <div><div class="sidenote">How can you have a committee with~0 members?  Find a way for that to make sense..</div></div>  -->
<li>How many 0-member committees can you make from 100 students?  (Does it make any sense to talk about a 0-member committee?)</li>
<hr /> 
<li>How did you solve question 10? Describe your method in words, so precisely that others in your class understand it.


</li>
<!-- <li>Here's a start on a reporter that will return the number of $k$-person committees that can be formed from $n$-students.
