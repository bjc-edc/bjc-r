<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>You're in a class with a total of five students: Rocky, Bullwinkle, Peabody, Sherman, and <u>(your name here)</u>. You want to choose a committee to get the refreshments for the class party.  Remember that "Rocky and Sherman" is the same committee as "Sherman and Rocky."</p>

<li>Fill in the blanks: "The number of committees of three people that include Bullwinkle is equal to the number of committees of ______ people that don't ______________."</li>
<li>How many different committees of three people <em>don't</em> include Bullwinkle?</li>
<li>Fill in the blanks: "The number of committees of three people that don't include Bullwinkle is equal to the number of committees of three people chosen from _____________."</li>
<li>How many different committees of three are there altogether?</li>
<li>How many different committees of two?</li>
<li>How many different committees of one?  (Is this a sensible questions?)</li>
<li>How many different committees of zero people?  (This is <em>for sure</em> not a sensible question, but it still has a sensible answer.  Discuss it with other students if you can't find one.)</li>
