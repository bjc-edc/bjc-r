        <div class="forYouToDo"><!-- I took off the id="first" because it's a hints page.  --MF, 2016-12-13 -->

            <!--<div class="todo">I'm just looking today and not getting down into the weeds, but just checking: is this the agreed approach? --MF, 12/21/17 <br /><br />
            ST I moved this from the regular page.<br />
            Excerpt from my June PD:
            -On the controversial issue of “including a finished product of a project via i-frames” both Michele and Jessica said that for the best kids, seeing the finished product, most likely will limit their creativity. But, the rest of the class would benefit from viewing such a product to get a sense for the overall project.  The compromise they suggested is that the i-framed finished product is included in the hints page to a project.  They were confident that their best kids would not automatically look at the hints.  They also encouraged us to have as many hints as possible as most kids need them and love them.

                this example project</a> and consider how you might design your own.  Here is an <em>example</em> algorithm for the shift cipher. Do it your way.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create and initialize (<code>set</code> to blank) three variables to store <var>inputText</var>, <var>shiftValue</var>, and <var>outputText</var>.</li>

                <div class="sidenote"><em>Plaintext</em> (or cleartext) is normal unencrypted text.</div>
                <li><code>Ask</code> the user to enter a <strong>plaintext</strong> message to be encoded.  <code>Set</code> the <var>inputText</var> variable to the <var>answer</var> from the user.</li>

                <li>
                    <code>Ask</code> the user to enter a shift value for the shift cipher.  <code>If</code> their <var>answer</var> <code>is a number</code>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>Set</code> the <var>shiftValue</var> variable to their <var>answer</var>.  </li>
                        <li><code>Ask</code> the user if they wish to encode or decode.</li>
                        <li>Then call a custom procedure to encrypt or decrypt the data. Here is an <em>example</em> <code>encode</code> algorithm. You could:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use it and write a <code>decode</code> reporter block on your own.</li>
                                <li>Modify this into a <code>encode/decode</code> block that uses negative shift values to decode.</li>
                                <li>Or create your own custom procedure and ignore the example.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/img_CaesarCipher/Code6.es.png" alt="Encode(text)(shift #){script variable(encodedText); set(encodedText) to (); for(i)=(1) to (length of (text)){set(encodedText) to (join(encodedText)(Encode One Character(lette..}; report(encodedText}" title="Encode(text)(shift #){script variable(encodedText); set(encodedText) to (); for(i)=(1) to (length of (text)){set(encodedText) to (join(encodedText)(Encode One Character(lette..}; report(encodedText}"/>
                        <div class="takeNote">Notice that <code>Encode</code> reporter relies on a simpler reporter, <code>Encode One Character</code>, that encodes a single character by shifting it a given amount. This abstraction makes the code easier to manage.</div>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Here are enough blocks to build <code>Encode One Character</code>:<br>

                </li>

                <li>Check that your code works as expected.</li>
