                <li>GH Feedback 1/3/16: Have you considered the possibility of calling the blocks PUBLIC KEY and PRIVATE KEY instead of ENCODE and DECODE? (The status quo is not bad, I am just thinking about reinforcing the metaphor.)</li>

                        <li>The last paragraph could use work. It randomly switches to the first person, which doesn't make sense.</li>
                        <li>This misses a big discussion point -- I think at this point the DigiNotar, Superfish, and Dell SSL issues are all worth discussing.</li>
                        <li>The XKCD is ok, but should we perhaps warn people to never post private keys if they don't get the joke? Instead of linking to the site, the link should be to that particular image.</li>

You'll now look at a general method for coding messages that shows how it's possible to let everyone know what your coding process is while still making the decoding process very difficult to figure out.</p>

            <p><em>Symmetric</em> cryptography, uses the <em>same secret key to encode and decrypt</em> a message. Symmetric cryptography has been around for thousands of years. The trouble with symmetric cryptography is: <em>how can we keep the key secret?</em></p>
			<div class="endnote">Long before computers,  riders on horseback could swallow the key to a message if they were captured. Now, messages <em>and keys</em> are sent over the  Internet, so symmetric cryptography won't work.</div>
			<p><em>Public key (asymmetric)</em> cryptography was created by mathematicians in the 1970s.  It uses <em>two different keys for encryption and decryption</em>, and knowing the encryption key doesn't let you figure out the decryption key.</p>
			<div class="endnote">For example, banks each have a public key, and when users enter their password on the bank web site, the user's browser encrypts the password with the bank's key before sending it over the Internet. Then, only the bank can decrypt that message.</div>
    <p>When you make a secure HTTP connection (the URL starts "https://" and a lock icon appears in the browser's URL bar), the browser uses a protocol called Transport Layer Security (TLS) or an older version called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) based on public key cryptography. The site to which you're connecting sends its public key, and your browser uses it to encrypt whatever information you send (such as your password for that site).</div>

					<div class="commentBig">This video is very nice and suggests a demo that teachers might want to do in class.  But, the more I think about it, the more I think it complicates the basic idea.  You don't need two separate keys to *send* a secure message.  Also, the modular arithmetic suffers from the same problem, and I think it's both too much and too little for the kids. --AC</div>

        <div class="ifTime">
        	<div class="endnote">It's also possible to use the private key for encryption and the public key for decryption.  That's no good for secret messages (why not?), but it's useful for <em>digital signatures</em>.  I use my private key to encrypt a message; you use my public key to decrypt it.  If you get a meaningful message as the result, that proves that the message was encrypted with my private key.  (If I want both secrecy and digital signing, I encrypt the message with my private key to sign it, then encrypt the encrypted result <em>again</em> with your public key to keep it secret. You decrypt it twice, first with your private key and then with my public key.) This is a nice example of <em>composition of functions:</em> the output from the first encryption is the input to the second encryption.</div>

        <div class="todo">The following set of exercises confuses me somewhat, for two reasons: (1) It's not specifically about public key, which is what I expect at this point in the narrative...[some comments and excercises moved to encryption page. -MF]</div>

		<h3>The Mathematics behind Cryptography</h3>
        <p>Cryptography uses mathematical ideas. The security in public key encryption relies on choosing an encryption key that is a difficult function to invert (undo). These one-way functions offer security because </p>

                <strong>Sending a secure message to Alice:</strong>
				<ol type="A">
                    <li>If Alice has function (let's call it <em>f</em>&thinsp;&thinsp;) that is difficult to invert (undo), then she can post the function, <em>f</em>, online for everyone to see because only she knows the inverse, <em>f</em>&thinsp;<sup>-1</sup>, that decodes the encoding by <em>f</em>.</li>
                    <li>If anyone (for example, Bob) wants to send Alice a secure message <em>M</em>, then he can run his message though Alice's one-way function and post the result for all the world to see. In function notation, he posts <em>f</em>&thinsp;(<em>M</em>&thinsp;). </li>
                    <li>Only Alice can decode <em>f</em>&thinsp;(<em>M</em>&thinsp;) since only she has the inverse function <em>f</em>&thinsp;<sup>-1</sup> that undoes <em>f</em>. She calculates <em>f</em>&thinsp;<sup>-1</sup>(<em>f</em>&thinsp;(<em>M</em>&thinsp;)). And since <em>f</em>&thinsp;<sup>-1</sup> is the inverse of (undoes) <em>f</em>, the result of her calculations is <em>M</em>, the message Bob sent.</li>
				</ol>
            </p>
		</div>
        <p>To send secure messages back and forth, Bob and Alice will <em>both</em> need to post their public keys and keep their inverse functions (their private keys) to themselves.</p>

            	<p>The original way that people constructed the function <span class="katex">f</span> was to use something like:</p>
                <p class="center"><span class="katex">f(x)= x^e \text{ mod } N</span></p>
                <p>Here, <span class="katex">N</span> is a product of 2 huge primes <span class="katex">p</span> and <span class="katex">q</span>. That is, <span class="katex">N=pq</span>. And <span class="katex">e</span> is relatively prime to (has no common factors with) the product <span class="katex">(p-1)(q-1)</span>.</p>
                <p>The public key is then the pair <span class="katex">(N,e)</span> and the secret key is the number <span class="katex">d</span> so that <span class="katex">ed \equiv (p-1)(q-1) \text{ mod } N</span>.</p>
