<b>Base Conversion</b><br>

First a reminder how to extract each digit in base 10 system.<br><br>

<b>Example:</b> If you were trying to extract the digits of a number, say, 527 in base 10, you would take the following steps.  
<br>(Recall that the floor() function rounds a number down to the closest integer.)<br>
<ol>
<li>Find the “ones” digit, via remainder in 527 divided by 10: <br>
527 mod 10 = <b>7</b><br>
Get quotient:<br>
floor(527/10)= 52</li>

<li>Repeat, find the “tens” digit, via remainder in 52 divided by 10: <br>
52 mod 10= <b>2</b><br>
Get quotient:<br>
floor(52/10)= 5</li>

<li>Repeat, find the “hundreds” digit, via remainder in 5 divided by 10: <br>
5 mod 10= <b>5</b><br>
Get quotient:<br>
floor(5/10)= 0<br><br>
</ol>
This is where we stop.</li>
So 527= <b>5</b>(100) + <b>2</b>(10) + <b>7</b>(1)<br>
Note with the algorithm we extracted the digits right to left. (7 first, 2 next, 5 last)<br><br>

<b>Example:</b> If you apply a similar procedure to get the binary representation of a number, say, 25, you would take the following steps.<br>
<ol>
<li>Find the “ones” digit, via remainder in 25 divided by 2: <br>
25 mod 2 = <b>1</b><br>
Get quotient:<br>
floor(25/2)= 12</li>

<li>Repeat, find the “twos” digit, via remainder in 12 divided by 2: <br>
12 mod 2= <b>0</b><br>
Get quotient:<br>
floor(12/2)= 6</li>

<li>Repeat, find the “fours” digit, via remainder in 6 divided by 2: <br>
6 mod 2= <b>0</b><br>
Get quotient:<br>
floor(6/2)= 3</li>

<li>Repeat, find the “eights” digit, via remainder in 3 divided by 2: <br>
3 mod 2= <b>1</b><br>
Get quotient:<br>
floor(3/2)= 1</li>

<li>Repeat, find the “sixteens” digit, via remainder in 1 divided by 2: <br>
1 mod 2= <b>1</b><br>
Get quotient:<br>
floor(1/2)= 0</li>
</ol>
This is where we stop.

Note with the algorithm again we extracted the digits right to left.<br>
So 27= <b>1</b>(16) + <b>1</b>(8)+ <b>0</b>(4) + <b>0</b>(2) + <b>1</b>(1) = (<b>11001</b>)<sub>2</sub><br><br>

Using these examples come up with an algorithm to represent any base 10 number in base 2.
