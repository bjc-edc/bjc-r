            <b>Specs:</b>  In this project you will create a timer that reports the number of seconds elapsed in both decimal and binary notations. <br>
				<li>Study the Binary Clock created in Snap<em>!</em> (linked below) until you gain some instinct how the binary system relates to the decimal system.</li>	
            
            <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-number-representation/binary-counter-preview.html" target="_blank"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/img_BinaryClock/BinaryClock.png" width="50%" alt=""/></a>

  <li>Study the examples in the Appendix, if needed, and discuss as a class how you can convert a number in base 10 to its equivalent in base 2.  Come up with a simple algorithm for this procedure.</li>

<li>Study the student file linked here. Note that 3 sprites representing the decimal digits, 8 sprites representing the binary digits, with all the necessary costumes (0-1 for binary 0-9 for decimal) have been created for you.  Also created is a sprite representing the “Timer”, for which you will need to fill in some code.  Snap!’s own “timer” block (from the “Sensing” menu) will be used as a time keeper.</li>

<li>In this project you will generate the binary number representation of decimal numbers 0 through 255.  While it takes 3 digits to represent 255 in base 10, it will require 8 digits in base 2.  Why?  </li>

<li>The computed decimal and binary digits are stored in lists and then a broadcast is made to the sprites representing the digits to put on the appropriate costumes (0 and 1 for the binary digits and 0 through 9 for the decimal digits)<br>

</li>
The “warp” block is needed as all the computation must be finalized prior to a screen refresh.
 
<li>The code for extracting the base 10 digits of a given number X. Note that last part of the code is used to pad the front of the number with zeros.  For example, as we are allocating 3 digits to represent the numbers, the number “42” is written as “042”.<br>

</li>
 


<li>Code for “dec1”, the sprite representing the first digit (hundreds) in the base 10 representation:<br>

 </li>
Note “join” block ensures that the digit is interpreted as a text so that costume with that name is called. The digit is not used as a number here because Snap! will always have the “Turtle” costume as the first costume by default.<br>

<li>Now review and understand the code for the rest of the sprites representing the decimal digits.  Check that your timer works in the decimal notation.</li>

<li>Now write the code for the “Binarize” custom block and review the code for the sprites representing the 8 binary digits. Check that the timer works in the binary notation.</li>
