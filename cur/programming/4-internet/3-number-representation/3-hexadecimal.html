        <p>Because humans have 10 fingers, the number system we commonly use is <strong>decimal </strong>(or base ten). Place value lets us re-use a few digits (0-9) for infinitely many numbers, depending on where the digits are placed. </p>
        <p>Each place is worth 10 times the place to its right. So an 8 in the ones place (10<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1) is worth just <em>eight</em>, an eight in the tens place (10<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10) is worth <em>eighty</em>, an 8 in the in the hundreds place (10<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;100) is worth <em>eight hundred</em>, an 8 in the thousands place (10<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1000) is worth <em>eight thousand</em>, and so on. </p>
        <div class="comment">Is this yellow box really necessary?  It's a lot of big words, it doesn't really further the topic, and it's true only about French-in-France; in Belgian French 80 is "octante." --bh (PS when spelling out numbers, hyphens go only between tens and ones, e.g., forty-three. Otherwise spaces, &quot;eight hundred.&quot;)</div>
        <div class="endnote">
          <p>Our way of <em>saying</em> numbers, like our way of <em>writing</em> numbers, is mostly  based on powers of ten too, as you can see in the number words above. But not completely! Many languages, including English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, Danish, German, Russian, Greek, Farsi, Hindi and many more, were <em>originally</em> based on 20. The French word for 87 is <em>quatre-vingt sept</em>, which, in English, would translate to "four twenties (and) seven." And when President Lincoln addressed the people at Gettysburg, he began with &quot;Fourscore and seven years ago,&quot; meaning &quot;87 years ago&quot;&mdash;a <em>score</em> was twenty. English and those other languages still have many hints of the original base 20 but are now mostly based on 10. <a href="http://www.sf.airnet.ne.jp/ts/language/number/tzotzil.html" target="_blank">Tzotzil</a>, a language of the Mayan in Mexico, uses base 20 completely. And there are other systems, too. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwandara_language" target="_blank">Nimbia dialect of the Gwandara language</a> in Nigeria uses base 12 for its number words, just as 12 became the base for time (twelve hours, twelve months) and five times twelve became the basis for time (sixty seconds, sixty minutes) and angle (6 times 60 degrees).</p>

        <p>As you learned in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-number-representation/1-binary.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 1</a>,<strong> binary</strong> representation uses only  two digits, 0 and 1. (A <strong>bit</strong> is the name for a <strong>bi</strong>nary digi<strong>t</strong>,) Their placement in the numeral multiplies their value by <strong>a power of 2</strong>. Computers use binary because it's easy for electronic circuits to have the voltage on a wire either on or off, instead of having to distinguish several different voltages.</p>
        <p>For example,</p>
        <p class="center"><span class="katex">1101011101_\text{base 2}</span></p>
        <p class="center"><em><strong>means</strong></em></p>
    	<p class="center"><span class="katex"> (1 \cdot 2^9) +(1 \cdot 2^8) + </span><span class="katex" style="color:grey">(0 \cdot 2^7)</span><span class="katex"> + (1 \cdot 2^6) + </span><span class="katex" style="color:grey">(0 \cdot 2^5)</span><span class="katex"> + (1 \cdot 2^4) + </span></p>
        <p class="center"><span class="katex"> (1 \cdot 2^3) + (1 \cdot 2^2) + </span><span class="katex" style="color:grey">(0 \cdot 2^1)</span><span class="katex"> + (1 \cdot 2^0) </span></p>
        <p class="center"><span class="katex">= 512 + 256 + </span><span class="katex" style="color:grey">(0 \cdot 128)</span><span class="katex"> + 64 + </span><span class="katex" style="color:grey">(0 \cdot 32)</span><span class="katex"> + 16 + 8 + 4 + </span><span class="katex" style="color:grey">(0 \cdot 2)</span><span class="katex"> + 1 = 861_\text{base 10}</span></p>
<p>So <span class="katex">1101011101_\text{base 2}</span> and <span class="katex">861_\text{base 10} </span> are two ways of writing the same number.</p>
<div class="endnote">
			Information in computers is generally stored in "bytes" that are 8 or 16 (or more) bits long.  So even though the binary numeral <span class="katex">1001_\text{ base 2}</span> requires only four bits, it might be stored as the 8-bit  byte <span class="katex">00001001</span>.

        <h3>Hexadecimal ("hex") notation</h3>-->
        <p>Because binary numerals are based on powers of a small number, they get long. (In the example above, a three-digit decimal representation is equivalent to a ten-digit binary representation.) So, we abbreviate binary using base 16&mdash;<strong>hexadecimal,</strong> or just <strong>hex</strong>&mdash;which packs 4 bits together as one digit.</p>

        <p> This works because 16 is a power of two, namely 2<sup>4</sup>. So <em>every</em> power of 16 is also a power of two: 16<sup>0</sup>=2<sup>0</sup>; 16<sup>1</sup>=2<sup>4</sup>; 16<sup>2</sup>=2<sup>8</sup>; 16<sup>3</sup>=2<sup>12</sup>; 16<sup>4</sup>=2<sup>16</sup>; etc. Each group of four bits (counting from the right) represents a value between 0 and 15 (1111<sub>base 2</sub>=15<sub>base 10</sub>), and those are the sixteen digits of base 16.</p>
    <p>But we can't use &quot;10,&quot; &quot;11.&quot; and so on as digits, because that would mess up place value. You wouldn't know whether the hexadecimal numeral 3124 means the four digits 3-1-2-4 or the three digits 3-12-4. Instead we have to use a single character to represent each digit, and by convention we use the letters a&ndash;f as the digits for 10 to 15. A=ten, b=eleven, ..., f=fifteen. Either capital or lower case letters can be used, but it's more common to see them in lower case.</p>
        <p>Hex is used for representing colors (as you saw in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-web-data/2-writing-html.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment#hex">Lab 1</a>) and in  IPv6 addresses (as you will see on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-protocols/1-ip-routing.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">the next page</a>).</p>
        <p>So, to convert the binary numeral 1101011101 to hexadecimal, start by dividing it into groups of four bits, from right to left: <span style="color:blue">11</span> <span style="color:red">0101</span> 1101. Then figure out the value of each group and write down the corresponding hex digit: <span style="color:blue">3</span><span style="color:red">5</span>d.</p>
        <div class="sidenote">1101011101<sub>base 2</sub> = 35d<sub>base 16</sub><br />
      But 35d is much shorter to write.</div>

			<p>It's convenient to choose base 16 as the abbreviated form of binary because pretty much all modern computers allocate memory in chunks of multiples of eight bits. (As we write this, the newest personal computers use 64 bits as their basic unit, but there are still a lot of 32-bit computers around.) Before the eight-bit byte became standard, people often used octal (base 8), in which each digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7) represents three  bits. Octal has the advantage that you don't have to remember what the digit C represents, but it's seen only rarely today.</p>

        <h3>Hexadecimal Colors</h3>
		<p>Computers have several ways of representing colors, depending on whether they are intended for controlling three-color (red, green, blue) screen display, four-color (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) printing, or other purposes. On a computer screen, each <strong>pixel</strong>—each dot that makes up the picture on the screen—is assigned an RGB color defined by the intensity of Red, Green, and Blue in that color. The intensities can range from 0 to 255 (decimal notation), which is 0 to FF (hex notation). If (R,G,B)=(0,0,0) the color is black: no red, no blue, no green.</p>
        <p>If <span style="color:#8000FF;"> (R,G,B) = (128,0,255), the color is purple: some red and a lot of blue, but no green at all.</span> If all three colors are as bright as possible (all are 255), we see white. Instead of writing (255,255,255) for white and (128,0,255) for purple, we often use hex notation: FFFFFF and 8000FF. And <span style="color:#FF7F00;"> this color is red 255, green 127, and blue 0</span>, which we would code as <span style="color:#FF7F00;">FF7F00</span>.</p>
        <div class="endnote">By the way, the HTML code for that last sentence is: 
			<pre>And &lt;span style=&quot;color:#FF7F00;&quot;&gt; this color is red 255, green 127, and blue 0&lt;/span&gt;, which we would code as &lt;span style=&quot;color:#FF7F00;&quot;&gt;FF7F00&lt;/span&gt;.</pre>

Load the Snap<em>!</em> RGB library (File menu, "Libraries...," "Set RGB or HSV pen color") into one of your projects to explore RGB color further. (As in all Snap<em>!</em> blocks, the numeric input slots take values in decimal, not hex.  Each color component has a value between 0 and 255, fitting in one byte.)<br />
