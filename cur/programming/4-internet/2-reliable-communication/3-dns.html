        <h2>Address Hierarchy</h2>
        <h3>Domain Name System (DNS) Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>Before the Internet, there were smaller networks of computers (for example, about 200 on the Arpanet at its peak), and every computer on a network knew the name of all the other computers on that network. This worked pretty well back when a computer cost roughly <em>a million dollars</em> and so there weren't very many of them. But that's not a strategy that can be scaled up for over 3 billion computers!</p>
        <div class="sidenoteBig">A <em>hierarchy</em> is an arrangement in which things are ranked one above the other according to status or inclusion. For example in biology, we use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank" target="_blank">taxonomic hierarchy</a>: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species.</div>
        <p>That's why Internet host names are <em>hierarchical</em>. If you want to know where <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">snap.berkeley.edu</a> is, your computer only has to know where to find an <em>edu</em> name server. And that  server only has to know where to find a <a href="http://berkeley.edu" target="_blank">berkeley.edu</a> name server. That server at UC Berkeley directs your computer to <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">snap.berkeley.edu</a>.</p>
		<div class="comment">In the future, I would like to do this for a URL that is more meaningful to the students in this class (e.g. snap.berkeley.org or bjc.edc.org). --MF</div>

        	Here's a model of the hierarchy for york.cs.berkeley.edu:<br />

        <div class="ifTime">
            <div class="endnote">
                <p>There are two kinds of top-level name domains: <strong>country codes</strong> and <strong>categories</strong>.  <a href="http://goes.gsfc.nasa.gov/text/web_country_codes.html" target="_blank">Every country</a> has an official two-letter country code (such as.us for the United States, .uk for the United Kingdom, or .th for Thailand).</p>
                <p>
                Originally, there were six category domains: 
                <ul>
                    <li><em>.gov</em> for government,</li>
                    <li><em>.edu</em> for educational institutions, </li>
                    <li><em>.com</em> for commercial businesses, </li>
                    <li><em>.mil</em> for (US) military sites, </li>
                    <li><em>.org</em> for general organizations, and</li> 
                    <li><em>.net</em> for network-related sites. </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More recently, new top-level category domains have been created, e.g., <em>.biz</em> for businesses, as an alternative to <em>.com</em>. These new categories are intended to relieve crowding in the original domains. For example, let's say you start a company called Garply Web Services. You can't have <a href="http://garply.com" target="_blank">garply.com</a>, which is taken by an online telephone directory service. But (as of October 2015) <a href="http://garply.biz" target="_blank">garply.biz</a> is available.</p>
                <p>There is still competition even with these new category domains. As soon as they were introduced, people bought huge numbers of common words in order to resell them at higher prices. For example, Mr. Robert Skelton of Cheswick, Australia offers the domain name <a href="http://snap.biz" target="_blank">snap.biz</a> for $7500. By contrast, you can buy <a href="http://garply.biz" target="_blank">garply.biz</a> for $7.99 if you hurry!</p>

	    <h3>IP Address Hierarchy</h3>
		<div class="todo">
            <ul>
        		<li>The following was constructed from Dan's internet PPTX and Brian's to original IP Page --MF</li>
                <li>
                    Next year, the text and graphic below should be changed to snap.berkeley.edu at 128.32.189.18. See Dan's PPTX files on Internet (<a href="http://cs10.org/sp15/lecture/L15%20-%20Internet%20I/" target="_blank">one</a> and <a href="http://cs10.org/sp15/lecture/L16%20-%20Internet%20II/" target="_blank">two</a>) to modify. --MF
                    <ul>
                        <li>I recognize that it's not as simple as "just changing to snap.berkeley.edu" because servers have all these funny rerouting things going on (and york might actually be where snap is, etc.). Brian, we should talk about this. (Or just leave me a comment here or in my inbox about it. Thanks!) --MF
                          <ul>
                            <li>snap.b.e is complicated; it's translated to byob.eecs.b.e which is in turn translated to eecs.b.e/~bh/byob. It'd be a little easier to talk about bjc.b.e, which is called bjc throughout the translation steps. But in the end they both are the same computer as eecs.b.e, namely 128.32.244.183. So you could legitimately ignore all that referral stuff and just say snap.b.e is 128.32.244.183. If you want a nearby computer for comparison, the one on my desk, abbenay.cs.b.e, is 128.32.153.200. Where did 128.32.189.18 come from?--bh</li>

                    Is "Recall" here true?  Have we talked about hierarchies before?  They haven't taken biology yet, maybe.--bh
                    <p>Yes, on page 1 of lab 1. --MF</p>

		<div class="sidenoteBig">Recall, a <em>hierarchy</em> is an ranking arrangement (like species taxonomy) with the broadest or most powerful rank at the top. It's often depicted as a pyramid.</div>
        <p><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/take-turns-speaking-mini.gif" alt="Take turns speaking" title="Take turns speaking"> Like domain names, IP addresses are <em>hierarchical</em>.</p>
        <p>For example, consider the IP address for york.cs.berkeley.edu, which is 128.32.156.218. In the picture below, the subnetwork for the 128.32 domain includes two subnet numbers: 189 and 156. Subnet 156 has two hosts: 218 and 226.</p>

        <div class="commentBig">If you redo the picture, don't try to divide the 128.32 into two levels of hierarchy.  There is no 128.*.*.* domain; back at the beginning of time, the Berkeley EECS Department bought a 65,536-address chunk of addresses at 128.32.*.* directly from, I'm guessing, Jon Postel, who was the official czar of the Internet back then.--bh</div>
    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/hierarchical-3.jpg" alt="IP addresses are hierarchical" title="IP addresses are hierarchical" /><br />        
    
    
	    <h3>IPv4</h3>
        <p>Each of the four numbers in a typical IP address today is an eight-bit <strong>byte</strong> with a value between 0 and 255:</p>
        <!--<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/ipv4.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="IPv4" title="IPv4" /><br />-->
        <p>A 32-bit IPv4 (the &quot;v&quot; stands for &quot;version&quot;) address is big enough to support 2<sup>32</sup> computers, which is about four billion (4 &middot; 10<sup>6</sup>). There are more than <em>seven</em> billion people on Earth, so there aren't enough IP addresses to go around.</p>
        <div class="endnote"><strong>Why 2<sup>32</sup>?</strong> There are 32 bits, and each bit can be one of two possible values (0 or 1). So, there are two possibilities for the first bit, four (that's 2<sup>2</sup>) possibilities for the first two bits, eight (that's 2<sup>3</sup>) possibilities for the first three bits, 16 (that's 2<sup>4</sup>) for the first four bits, and so on up to 2<sup>32</sup> possibilities for thirty-two bits.</div>
	
    
        <h3>IPv6</h3>
        <p>The long-term solution is to increase the length of an IP address. The new IP addresses are 128 bits wide, which is enough to support 2<sup>128</sup> computers:</p>
		<!--<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/ipv6.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="IPv6" title="IPv6" />-->
        
		<div class="endnote">2<sup>128</sup> is about 10<sup>38</sup>. For contrast, there are about 10<sup>50</sup> atoms in the Earth and an estimated 10<sup>29</sup> stars in the observable universe. So even if the Internet is extended to include other planets or space aliens, we'll <em>still</em> have enough addresses with IPv6 (but not if every atom had its own IP address).</div>

        <div class="takeNote"> Different protocols can be used at the same time; both IPv4 and IPv6 are in use today.  This is a great example of the importance of abstraction. Most traffic (even traffic across new routers capable of IPv6) still uses IPv4. This is because in order to make an IPv6 connection, all the routers along the way must recognize IPv6.  Old routers are replaced all the time, and eventually every router on the Internet will use IPv6.</div>
