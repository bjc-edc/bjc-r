        <h2>Network Redundancy</h2>
		<p>With such an enormous amount of data traveling around, the Internet needs to be reliable, and we have achieved this by making the Internet <strong>redundant</strong>. Wherever information is going, there is more than one way to get there. So if part of the Internet fails, the rest remains connected even if the failed part is in the usual path from one place to another. This increases the Internet's <strong>fault tolerance</strong> (ability to work around problems) and helps the Internet <strong>scale</strong> (expand) to more devices and people.</p>
		<div class="endnote">Internet <strong>scalability</strong> is the ability of the net to keep working even as the size of the network and the amount of traffic over the network increase. The page <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2013/01/16/internet-2012-in-numbers/" target="_blank">Internet 2012 in numbers</a> has some astonishing numbers about Internet traffic from a few years ago.</div>

                In this model of a network, what is the <em>minimum</em> number of nodes (connection points) that can stop working before the sender and the receiver can't communicate?

                    There are no nodes that are vital to the system. Pick any node to stop working, and you can still find another path.

                    Correct! If the node with 6 connections goes down and also either of the two to its left, the sender and receiver can't communicate.
