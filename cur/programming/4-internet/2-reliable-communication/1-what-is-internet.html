            	Dan Feedback 1/17/16: You have the following as "integrate as needed next year":
                <ul>
                    <li>Bandwidth: a measure of bit rate—the amount of data (measured in bits b) that can be sent in a fixed time. Usually b/s</li>
                    <li>Latency: the time elapsed between the transmission and the receipt of a request. Usually ms.</li>
                </ul>
                BUT bandwidth and latency are part of the CF so they need to occur somewhere this year...
            </p>
            <p><strong>6.2.2J</strong> The bandwidth of a system is a measure of bit rate – the amount of data (measured in bits) that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.</p>
            <p><strong>6.2.2K</strong> The latency of a system is the time elapsed between the transmission and the receipt of a request.</p>

        	People talk as if "the Internet" and "the World Wide Web" are the same thing, but they are not. The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> is the collection of interlinked website documents (such as <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-web-data/1-writing-html.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">HTML</a> files) that you can view with a web browser by typing <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-reliable-communication/3-urls.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">URLs</a> such as <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html</a>.<br />

        <div class="takeNote">
            <h4>What is a URL?</h4>
            A <strong>URL</strong> or Uniform Resource Locator is an address for accessing specific web data located on a <strong>server</strong> (a computer hosting data for others to access). URLs can be broken into three parts:<br />
            <div class="sidenote">The protocol is not visible in the location bar of some browsers (like Chrome).</div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/URL-structure.jpg" alt="parts of a URL" title="parts of a URL" />
            <ul>
                <li><span class="red">protocol</span> - the standard for communication between browsers and servers (usually "http" or "https")</li>
                <li><span class="darkgreen">domain name</span> - the name of the server that hosts the data</li>
                <li> <span class="blue">path</span> - the location of the data in a hierarchy of folders on the server <!--Different hosts interpret the rest of the URL in different ways, but usually additional slashes describe a path in a hierarchy of folders.  Other punctuation, such as ?, =, and &amp; are used to provide the server with parts of a request other than the path to a page.--></li>
                <div class="endnote">For example, the URL shown above tells a browser to use the <span class="red">http</span> protocol to access the <span class="darkgreen">bjc.berkeley.edu</span> server and then go to the <span class="blue">website</span> folder and open the <span class="blue">privacy.html</span> file.</div>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <img class="imageRight" height="100" src="http://snap.berkeley.edu/liam4/Logo5.png" alt="" title="" />

        <p>But the Internet is more general than the World Wide Web. It also supports email<!-- (which can sometimes be seen through a web browser but is transmitted with a different protocol)-->, file transfers, mobile apps, texting, and many other ways that computers communicate behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is a massive network of computers that communicate. They do this primarily by using a pair of <strong>protocols</strong> (standards for communication):
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-communication-protocols/1-ip.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment"><strong>IP</strong></a> (Internet Protocol), an addressing system that finds paths to distant computers</li>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-communication-protocols/2-tcp.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment"><strong>TCP</strong></a> (Transmission Control Protocol), a transmission system that assures reliable transmission of data</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            Given the scale of the Internet, the computing algorithms to ensure that all data reach their destinations must continue to work even as the Internet grows. To meet this need, the Internet was designed to be:
			<ul>
				<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/redundant-2.jpg" alt="network redundancy" title="network redundancy" />
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-reliable-communication/3-network-redundancy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment"><strong>Redundant</strong></a>: There are multiple pathways for data to travel; so even if one pathway is unavailable, there is still another way to go.</li>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-reliable-communication/4-hierarchy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment"><strong>Hierarchical</strong></a>: The Internet addressing systems obey a hierarchy to improve efficiency. This hierarchy works much like the postal system, which locates people first by state, then city, then street, then house number, then apartment number, and then finally by person.</li>
