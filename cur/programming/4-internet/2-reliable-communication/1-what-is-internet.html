        <p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is a network of independent but connected <em>devices</em> all over the world. People talk as if "the Internet" and "the World Wide Web" are the same thing, but they are not. The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> is the collection of interlinked website <em>documents</em> (such as <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-web-data/1-writing-html.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">HTML</a> files) that you can view with a web browser by typing URLs such as <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html</a>.</p>
        
        <div class="takeNote">
            <h4>What is a URL?</h4>
            A <strong>URL</strong>, or <strong>Uniform Resource Locator</strong>, is an address for accessing specific web data located on a <strong>server</strong> (a computer hosting data for others to access). URLs can be broken into three parts:<br />
            <div class="sidenote">The <span class="red">protocol</span> is not visible in the location bar of some browsers (like Chrome).</div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/URL-structure.jpg" alt="parts of a URL" title="parts of a URL" />
            <ul>
                <li><span class="red">protocol</span> - the standard for communication between browsers and servers (usually "http" or "https")</li>
                <li><span class="darkgreen">domain name</span> - the name of the server that hosts the data</li>
                <li> <span class="blue">path</span> - the location of the data in a hierarchy of folders on the server </li>
                <div class="endnote">For example, the URL shown above tells a browser to use the <span class="red">http</span> protocol to access the <span class="darkgreen">bjc.berkeley.edu</span> server and then go to the <span class="blue">website</span> folder and open the <span class="blue">privacy.html</span> file.</div>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>But the Internet is more general than the World Wide Web. It also supports email, file transfers, mobile apps, texting (a.k.a. SMS or Short Message Service), and many other ways that computers communicate behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is a massive network of computers that communicate. They do this primarily by using a pair of <strong>protocols</strong> (standards for communication) that you will learn more about in Lab 4:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-communication-protocols/1-ip.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment"><strong>IP</strong></a> (Internet Protocol), an addressing system that finds paths to distant computers</li>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-communication-protocols/2-tcp.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment"><strong>TCP</strong></a> (Transmission Control Protocol), a transmission system that assures reliable transmission of data</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            Given the scale of the Internet, the computing algorithms to ensure that all data reach their destinations must continue to work even as the Internet grows. To meet this need, the Internet was designed to be:

                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-reliable-communication/3-network-redundancy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment"><strong>Redundant</strong></a>: There are multiple pathways for data to travel; so even if one pathway is unavailable, there is still another way to go.</li>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-reliable-communication/4-hierarchy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment"><strong>Hierarchical</strong></a>: The Internet addressing systems obey a hierarchy to improve efficiency. This hierarchy works much like the postal system, which locates people first by state, then city, then street, then house number, then apartment number, and then finally by person.</li>
