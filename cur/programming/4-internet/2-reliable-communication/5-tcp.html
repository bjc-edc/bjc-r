        <h2>Reliable Transmission on Unreliable Networks: TCP</h2>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYdF7b3nMto" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen class="indent"></iframe>
    	<p>Computers, servers, and routers are fairly reliable. But there are often several computers and cables or radio transmissions between you and the recipient of a data packet. So, every once in a while a IP packet will be lost. Devices on the Internet need to tolerate these faults. The <strong>Transmission Control Protocol</strong> (TCP) guarantees <em>reliable</em> transmission by breaking messages into packets and keeping track of which packets have been received successfully.</p>
        <div class="sidenoteBig">By contrast, old land line telephone systems established a long-term physical connection from one telephone to another, for as long as the phone call continued.</div>
		<p>A <strong>packet</strong> is a small message.  Typically, if you want to send a <em>large</em> message, your computer divides it into small chunks that it sends individually.  This is important because if a router that's handling a chunk of your message fails, only that chunk has to be resent, rather than the entire message. The Internet is a <strong>packet switching</strong> network.</p>

                The TCP/IP <strong>end-to-end</strong> design of the Internet is an <strong>abstraction</strong>:
                <ul>
					<li>The <strong>routers</strong> at every connection point  run the <strong>Internet Protocol</strong> (IP) that transmit the packets from one IP address to another, not caring that sometimes a packet will be lost, and not knowing anything about the purpose or meaning of a packet.</li>
                    <li>And the <strong>computers</strong> (including servers) at the endpoints run the <strong>Transmission Control Protocol</strong> (TCP) that guarantees <em>reliable</em> transmission. (The endpoint computers are also responsible for understanding <em>application protocols</em> such as HTTP.)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The routers don't have to know anything about the messages they carry over the net; all they care about is transmitting between the IP addresses at the beginning of each packet. The computers that send and receive the message are the only ones that have to think about what the messages mean. As a result, when someone invents a new application for the Internet, all the routers in the world don't have to be replaced or reprogrammed&mdash;to them it's all just bits.</p>

                    On the stage there are two watchers: "Alice incoming transmission" and "Bob incoming transmission."  But in the Variables palette there's only one variable name: "incoming transmission."  These are actually two different <em>local variables</em>; one belongs to Alice and one belongs to Bob. (Local means not shared across sprites; <em>global</em> means shared across all sprites as we've been doing most of the course.)

                Build a simple TCP. Resolve the unreliability so that messages are received reliably despite the limitations of IP packets. <strong>You'll need to change</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>The definition of <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/internet-transmit.png" alt="internet transmit (message) to (sprite)" title="internet transmit (message) to (sprite)" /></li>
                    <li>The script for <em>each</em> sprite that starts with <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/when-get-any.png" alt="when I receive (any message)"></li>
                </ul>

	        <div class="takeNote">Note: because this is a simulation, you could always "solve" the problem by rewriting the program to simulate a perfect network instead of an imperfect one, but that's against the rules of this game. <strong>You may not change the definition of <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/send-IP.png" alt="send IP packet () to (sprite)">.</strong></div>

                <div class="sidenoteBig">How can you keep track of the order of your data?</div>
                <li>First, solve the problem of packets arriving out of order.  That is, make it possible for the receiver to rearrange the packets into the intended order.  This will require cooperation by both sender and receiver.</li>
		        <div class="endnote">A packet can include any kind of data: text, numbers, or lists. <em>You may include extra <strong>header </strong>information in a packet in addition to the one text character.</em></div>
                <li>Then, solve the problem of packets not arriving at all. That is, make the transmission reliable even though IP is unreliable. This, too, will require changing both sender and receiver.  </li>
                <div class="endnote">For the sake of the simulation, you can't do this by eliminating the unreliability of <code>send IP packet</code>. <em>The sender will have to send a special end-of-transmission packet so that the receiver knows when to stop worrying about missing packets.</em></div>
