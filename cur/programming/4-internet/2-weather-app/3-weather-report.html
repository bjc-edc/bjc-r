<h2>Building A Weather Report</h2>
<p>Now you can query the National Weather Service for current temperature and weather conditions. Let's combine that with our work on lists.</p>

<p> Idea here: build two types of reports. One, a bunch of cities and their conditions. Two, a sentence report like "In Boston, it's rainy and 62 degrees." Note that in some cases the condition report is unsuitable for a sentence so there would have to be some switch-outs, if that's sensible.</p>

<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>Identify some other Web sites where information in the URL is used in processing. For each site, describe how the information is used.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>The National Weather Service is a U.S. Government agency providing current weather and forecasting. Like Google, the National Weather Service's website changes from different inputs, such as these:</p>

<p><code>http://forecast.weather.gov/zipcity.php?inputstring=10002</code></p>
<div class="sidenote">Here, <code>inputstring</code> is a ZIP code, a five-digit code matching a town or part of a city. Try entering your ZIP code.
</div>

<p><code>http://forecast.weather.gov/zipcity.php?inputstring=Boston, MA</code></p>

<p>In this lab, you will pull the most useful bits of information from these pages to build a simple weather app.</p>

<div class="forYouToDo"><ol start="2">
<li>Use the "View Source" command in your Web browser to look at the HTML generated by the National Weather Service page. Where in the HTML is the current weather and temperature shown?</li>
<li>Use the scraping techniques from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-read-web/2-scrape-data.html">Lab 1</a> to help design the <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/current-temp.png" alt="Current Temperature In block"> block. The input is a ZIP code or a city and state, and the output is the current temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
