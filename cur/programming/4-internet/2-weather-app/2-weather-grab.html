        <h2>Pulling Weather Data</h2>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Identify some other Web sites where information in the URL is used in processing. For each site, describe how the information is used.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>The National Weather Service is a U.S. Government agency providing current weather and forecasting. Like Google, the National Weather Service's website changes in response to different inputs, such as these:</p>
        
        <p>
        	<ul>
                <div class="sidenote">Here, <var>inputstring</var> is a ZIP code, a five-digit code matching a town or part of a city. Try entering your ZIP code.</div>
                <div class="comment">
                  <p>This sidenote could be misunderstood to read that <var>inputstring</var> is a placeholder for a ZIP code (and should be replaced by it). We should clarify that <em>what <var>inputstring</var> equals</em> is the zip code. Also, perhaps there should be a sidenote for the image below too? --MF</p>
                  <p>PG: Yes. There are also other things that are assumed in problem 1 and the commentary afterward. It is not an <em>intellectual</em> challenge to find Web sites where information in the URL is used in processing, but <em>finding</em> such a site requires luck, or knowledge that we can't be sure the kids have, or potentially a lot of time. </p>
            </div>
                <div class="comment">BTW, after clicking that link, the URL changes, and I do not see it in the address bar as shown here... Does that matter? --MF</div>
                
				<li>
                	<a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/zipcity.php?inputstring=Boston, MA" target="_blank">http://forecast.weather.gov/zipcity.php?inputstring=Boston, MA</a><br />

<p>In this lab, you will pull two pieces of information—the weather conditions and temperature—from these pages to build a simple weather app. For NYC, the page above shows that these were 62°F and Partly Cloudy.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="2">
                <li>Use the "View Source" command in your Web browser to look at the HTML generated by the National Weather Service page. Where in the HTML is the current weather and temperature shown?</li>
                <div class="comment">
                  <p>I am not getting anything in this project to work with these URLs above... --MF</p>
                  <p>PG:  I can type the URL http...blah.../zipcity.php?inputstring=Boston,MA and get what I want, but the URL then changes to http...blah.../MapClick.php?CityName=Boston&amp;state=MA&amp;site=BOX&amp;textField1=42.3583&amp;textField2=-71.0603&amp;e=0#.VkDUYSpVhBc. The student needs at least some (optional) comment on that not being an error. For me, I don't even know why the URL would change, since the URL I typed produced the result I wanted. </p>
            </div>
                <li>Use the scraping techniques from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-web-data-communication-protocols/2-scrape-data.html">Lab 1</a> to design a <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/current-temp.png" alt="Current Temperature In block"> block. The input is a ZIP code or a city and state, and the output is the current temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/current-temp-62.png" alt="62 degrees in New York">
                <li>Build a similar block to give the current weather conditions (like "Partly Cloudy" or "Overcast") for the location you specified.</li>
                <li><div class="saveAs"><span class="text">"U4L2-WeatherInfo"</span><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-this-as.png" alt="save your work as U4L2-WeatherInfo" title="save your work as U4L2-WeatherInfo" /></div></li>
            </ol>
            <div class="todo">
              <p>Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but proxied http reports: </p>
              <p>  <img src="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-weather-app/temporary-comment-images/proxied-http-fail.png" width="650" alt="fail"> </p>
              <p>(btw, random bug report: control shift click gave context menu with &quot;script pic with result...&quot; but did <em>not</em> produce the image. This, as you see, is just a screen snap after that failure.)</p>
			  <p> Ugh, this could be a big problem. The fact that the HTTP redirects to a second page could be causing problems for Snap's read-in. Yep, sure enough, Snap can't read these pages. Will talk with Brian and re-assess what to do, but we might need to use an altogether different weather resource.</p>
