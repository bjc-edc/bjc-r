        <p>As you know, numbers show up everywhere in computer algorithms&mdash;even if numbers aren't the topic. For example, the user may be interested in a picture, but that picture is an abstraction over numbers. Numbers are also used to find a specific item in a list. Over the next several pages, you'll look more closely at numbers inside the computer.</p>

		<h3>Fixed Width Computer Hardware</h3>
        <div class="vocabBig">
        	<p><strong>width</strong>: the number of bits that a CPU processes at a time</p>
            <p><strong>word</strong>: a binary sequence of that many bits</p>
        </div>
        <p>So why did Snap<em>!</em> display 20! in ordinary whole number representation but 30! in scientific notation? Every computer model is designed with a certain<strong> width</strong>, the number of bits that the processor reads from memory or writes into memory at a time. That number of bits is called a <strong>word</strong>. As of 2016, most new computers are 64 bits wide. The first microcomputer, sold in 1971, was four bits wide!</p>
		<div class="endnote">If you got an answer in scientific notation for 20!, you're using a 32-bit computer.</div>
        <div class="comment">DAT-1.B.1</div>
        <p>A 64-bit word represents 2<sup>64</sup> different values. We use half for negative numbers, one for zero, and the rest for positives. Half of 2<sup>64</sup> (which is 2<sup>63</sup> = 9,223,372,036,854,775,808) is about 9 &times; 10<sup>18</sup>. That means that the 19 digits of 20! just barely fit in a 64-bit word. But the 33 digits of 30! don't. So the computer hardware reports an <em>overflow</em> error, and Snap<em>!</em> computes an approximation.</p>
            
        <div class="endnote">
        	<a href="#hint-power-2" data-toggle="collapse" title="Are processor widths always powers of two?">Are processor widths always powers of two?</a>
            <div id="hint-power-2" class="collapse">Processor widths don't have to be a power of two. Some old computers&mdash;the kind you see in old movies that filled a large room&mdash;used 12-bit, 36-bit, and 60-bit words. But modern personal computers started at 8 bits and the widths have been doubling with each new generation.</div>

		<h3>Bignums</h3><div class ="sidenote"> A multiple-word integer is called a <strong>bignum</strong>. </div>
        <div class="comment">DAT-1.B.2</div>
        <p>Why can't programming languages just use more than one word to represent an integer? They can. It's just that a single machine language instruction can only add one-word numbers. A programming language must work a little harder to make addition work with multiple-word values. Not all languages do this, but the highest-level languages do. </p>

            <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
            <ol type="A">
            	<li>A great example of a high-level programming language is <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/index.html" title="MIT: Scheme" target="_blank">Scheme</a>. You can learn it from the free, online book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html" title="Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" target="_blank">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>.</li>

        </div>  
        
        <div class="takeNote">The design of a programming language isn't just a question of taste; it can be a matter of life and death. Between 1985 and 1987, a therapeutic X-ray machine   killed four patients and seriously injured two more because of several bugs in its software; one of the bugs was that a   counter that was kept in an eight-bit-wide variable would reach its maximum value of 127 and then <em>overflow</em> to zero instead of 128. When the variable was zero, an important safety check was not performed. This would not have happened if the   software had been written in a better programming language.</div>
