    	<h2>Binary Representation</h2>        
        
        <p>We've looked at how the number of bits used to represent an integer affects how big it can be. Now we turn to the specific way a single-word  integer is encoded as bits.</p>
        <div class="vocab">: <strong>Bit</strong>
            <div class="todo">DAT-1.A.3</div>
            <p>The word "bit" is an abbreviation for <em><strong>bi</strong>nary digi<strong>t</strong>.</em></p>
        </div> 
            
        <div class="comment">DAT-1.C.1</div>
        <p>People generally use base ten (decimal) digits to write numbers. Computers use base two (binary).</p>
		
        <div class="comment">DAT-1.C.3</div>
		<p>
            In <strong>base 10</strong>, there are ten digits (0-9), and each place is worth <em>ten</em> times as much as the place to its right. <br />

        <div class="comment">DAT-1.C.2</div>
        <p>
            In <strong>binary, base 2</strong>, there are only two digits (0 and 1), and each place is worth <em>two</em> times the place to its right.<br />
            <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/binary-places.jpg" alt="place values in binary 1101: 1 8's 1 4's 0 2's 1 1's" title="place values in binary 1101: 1 8's 1 4's 0 2's 1 1's" />
        </p>
        <div class="endnote">The subscript 2 on 1101<sub>2</sub> means the 1101 is in base 2. Numbers are normally written in base 10, so a subscript 10 is only used when needed for clarity.</div>
        
        <h3>Reading Binary</h3>
        <div class="comment">DAT-1.C.5</div>
        <p>In <strong>base 10</strong> notation, each place value represents a <strong>power of ten</strong>: the units place (10<sup>0</sup> = 1), the tens place (10<sup>1</sup> = 10), the hundreds place (10<sup>2</sup> = 100), the thousands place (10<sup>3</sup> = 1000), etc. So, for example:</p>
        <p class="center"> 9827  &nbsp; = &nbsp; 9 &times;  10<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 8 &times;  10<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 2 &times;  10<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 7 &times;  10<sup>0</sup></p>
        <div class="comment">DAT-1.C.4</div>
        <p>
            <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/binary-places(18).jpg" alt="place values in binary 10010: 1 16's 0 8's 0 4's 1 2's 0 1's" title="place values in binary 10010: 1 16's 0 8's 0 4's 1 2's 0 1's" />
            <strong>Base 2</strong> uses the same idea but with <strong>powers of two</strong> instead of powers of ten. Binary place values represent the units place (2<sup>0</sup> = 1), the twos place (2<sup>1</sup> = 2), the fours place (2<sup>2</sup> = 4), the eights place (2<sup>3</sup> = 8), the sixteens place (2<sup>4</sup> = 16), etc. So, for example:
        </p>
        <p align="center">10010<sub>2</sub> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <strong>1 &times; 2<sup>4</sup></strong>	 &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0 &times; 2<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0 &times; 2<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; <strong>1 &times; 2<sup>1</sup></strong> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0 &times; 2<sup>0</sup> &nbsp; = &nbsp; 16 &nbsp;+&nbsp; 2 &nbsp; = &nbsp; 18<sub>10</sub></p>

		<h3>Writing Binary</h3>
        <div class="takeNote">
			<p>To translate from base 10 (like 89<sub>10</sub>) to base 2, <strong>first write out the binary place values</strong> by <em>doubling left from the units place</em> until you get to a value larger than your number (128 for this example). <strong>Then think</strong>, "I can take out a 64, so I write a 1 there, and there's 25 left (89&nbsp;âˆ’&nbsp;64). I have 0 thirty-twos, because I only have 25. But I can take out 16, and there's 9 left. So, 8 and 1 are the last nonzero bits.</p>
      <!--      <div class="sidenoteBig">Either way you are converting (and between any bases), always write the place values right-to-left (just as with units, tens, hundreds, etc.), and always write the number itself left-to-right.</div>  -->
