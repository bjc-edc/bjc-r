		<p>We can pack four bits (binary digits) into one hexadecimal digit because 16 is a power of two (16 = 2<sup>4</sup>). So, a group of four bits represents a value between 0 and 15, and one hex digit also represents values from 0-15 (using 0-9 and A-F). This makes it easier to translate between binary and hex than between other bases.</p>
        <p>Hexadecimal is an abstraction over binary: we use hexadecimal to abbreviate binary in a more readable way.</p>

        <h3>Translating between Binary and Hex</h3>
        <div class="takeNote">
        	<p>To translate a binary numeral (for example, 1101011101<sub>2</sub>) to hexadecimal, <strong>start by splitting it into groups of four bits</strong>, from right to left (like this: <span class="blue">11</span> <span class="red">0101</span> <span class="darkgreen">1101</span>).</p>
            <p>Then <strong>determine the value of each group and write the corresponding hex digit</strong> (look it up on the table at right).</p>
            <p>For example: <span class="blue">11</span><sub>2</sub> = <span class="blue">3</span><sub>16</sub>, <span class="red">0101</span><sub>2</sub> = <span class="red">5</span><sub>16</sub>, and <span class="darkgreen">1101</span> = <span class="darkgreen">D</span><sub>16</sub>. So, 1101011101<sub>2</sub> = 35D<sub>16</sub>.</p>

        	<p>To translate a hex numeral (like 4E1<sub>16</sub>) to binary, <strong>write each hex digit as a group of four bits</strong> (including any leading zeros).</p>

So, 4E1<sub>16</sub> = 010011100001<sub>2</sub> or just 10011100001<sub>2</sub> because we can drop the leading zero once the digits are all in their places.</p>

		<h3>Hexadecimal Colors</h3>
		<div class="vocab">
        	<p>A <strong>pixel</strong> is a single dot of color on the computer screen. It's short for "picture element."</p>
        </div>
        <p>Computers have several ways of representing color depending on the purpose. For example, three-color <strong>RGB</strong> (red, green, blue) is used for screen display, and four-color <strong>CMYK</strong> (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) is used for printing. On a computer screen, each <strong>pixel</strong> that makes up a picture is assigned an RGB color code that defined by the intensity of red, green, and blue in that color. These three color intensities each range from 0 to 255 (one byte is used for each of the three colors), which is 00 to FF in hex notation.  </p>
        <p>If <span style="color:#8000FF;"> (R, G, B) = (128, 0, 255), the color is purple: some red and as much blue as possible, but no green at all.</span> If all three colors are as bright as possible (all are 255), we see white; if they are as dark as possible (all are 0), we see black. Instead of writing (255, 255, 255) for white and (128, 0, 255) for purple, we often use hex notation: FFFFFF and 8000FF. And <span style="color:#FF7F00;"> this color is red 255, green 127, and blue 0</span>, which is <span style="color:#FF7F00;">FF7F00</span> in hex.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <a href="#hint-color-codes" data-toggle="collapse" title="Learn more about color codes">Learn more about color codes.</a>
            <div id="hint-color-codes" class="collapse">
                <p>Sometimes a fourth number is used to represent the color <em>transparency,</em> like the ghost effect you used in your very first BJC project on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/4-keeping-score.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 1 Lab 1 Page 3: Make It a Game">Unit 1 Lab 1 Page 3: Make It a Game</a>. </p>
                <p><strong>RGB works well for <em>lights</em></strong>, such as the tiny lights (pixels) in your computer screen, so it is great for computers. But it's not good for printers: no combination of Red, Green and Blue sprayed on paper would quite make black, zero of each would leave the paper white (not black), and artists know that mixing red and green paint does not make yellow (but that's how you make yellow with light: FFFF00). <strong>Ink or paint colors are measured in <em>CMYK</em></strong>: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black. And some colors such as brown and brick-red (darker than pure red) are hard to figure out in RGB units, even for display in lights. Another color system is called <strong>HSB</strong>, for <em>hue, saturation, brightness.</em></p>
                <p>Snap<em>!</em>'s system is similar to HSB. "Pen color" is hue (location on the rainbow), and "pen shade" is more or less saturation (zero means black, 100 means full rainbow color).</p>

                <li>Another way to represent colors is by their names.

                <li>In earlier units, we used abstraction to describe creating custom blocks and abstract data types. Here, we use abstraction to talk about hexadecimal vs. binary. How can abstraction describe these very different things? What do these things have in common?</li>
