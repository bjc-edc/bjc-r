                    GH Feedback from Josh (email address in Issue #221) 9/2/15: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>No way that binary numerals will take 15-20 minutes as suggested in the teacher's manual. It's not a long lecture for me, but I could imagine it consuming more than one class period, depending on the teacher and the students.</li>
                        <li>This page feels out of place and rushed. The explanation is fine for someone who is inclined to do mathematics, but several of my students find it awkward. Of all the labs so far, this one seems to require the most intervention.</li>
                        <li>It would be helpful if there were some small binary numbers to translate. Instead of writing numbers with lead zeroes (we don't do that with decimal numbers, do we?), just write the binary number. (A 2 subscript for binary numbers might not be bad.) 101 base 2 is 5. That would be a nice, small starting problem. Instead, the first part of #7 is 10000111 base 2, and that could be a load for a lot of students.</li>
                        <li>In #8, I love how you are communicating the meaning of "bit" but I think it will be lost on a lot of people unless supplemented with something like, "Wonder where the word "bit" comes from?"<ul><li>Addressed by code.org video. --MF</li></ul></li>

                    Take it Further A and B are the same type of question, right?
                </li>
                <li>GH Feedback 10/20/15: Under the For You To Do: Questions 2 and 4 mean by using different powers of 2, right? Nothing is repeated? Also for # 6, 21 and 15 already use more than 2 powers of two to arrive at the respective number. Do they mean to say "Are there any whole numbers that cannot be formed from adding different powers of 2?"</li>

        <p>In <strong>decimal</strong> notation, each place value represents a <strong>power of ten</strong>: the units place (10<sup>0</sup> = 1), the tens place (10<sup>1</sup> = 10), the hundreds place (10<sup>2</sup> = 100), the thousands place (10<sup>3</sup> = 1000), etc. So, for example:</p>
    	<div class="sidenote">The symbol "XVIII" in Roman numerals  represents the same number as the decimal representation "18." In binary, we write "10010" for "18," but it's still the same number. So there's no such thing as a "binary number," just binary <em>representation.</em></div>
    	<p class="center"> 9827  &nbsp; = &nbsp; 9 &times;  10<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 8 &times;  10<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 2 &times;  10<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 7 &times;  10<sup>0</sup></p>
        <!--<div class="endnote"><strong>Why right to left?</strong>  the rightmost digit is always multiplied by 10<sup>0</sup>, but in a long number such as 432786149314152718281828459045 you can't tell what power of 10 to multiply the leftmost digit by, until you count up to it from the right.)</div>-->

		<p><strong>Binary</strong> uses the same idea but with <strong>powers of two</strong> instead of powers of ten. So, for example:</p>
        
        <p align="center">10010 (in binary) &nbsp; = &nbsp; <span class="blue">1 &times; 2<sup>4</sup></span>	 &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0 &times; 2<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0 &times; 2<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; <span class="blue">1 &times; 2<sup>1</sup></span> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0 &times; 2<sup>0</sup> &nbsp; = &nbsp; 16 &nbsp;+&nbsp; 2 &nbsp; = &nbsp; 18 (in decimal)</p>
        <br />

		<p>Decimal notation is called <strong>base ten</strong>. It's the usual way of representing numbers with the digits "0&quot;&ndash;&quot;9." Binary is <strong>base two</strong>. It only uses two digits: "0" and "1." </p>
        <p>
        	In both systems, place value always starts from the units place and goes up <em>right to left</em> (just as you learned in elementary school):
