         In this project you will create a timer that reports the number of seconds elapsed in both decimal and binary notations. <br><br>
		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
       
			<ol>
           
				<li>Study the Binary Counter shown above to gain some instinct how the binary system relates to the decimal system.</li>	
            
            

  <li>Review the   <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Convert-from-Decimal-to-Binary" target="_blank">examples presented here</a> and discuss as a class how you can convert a number in base 10 to its equivalent in base 2.  Note that there are two methods presented in the link.   The first method,(<em>Short Division by Two with Remainder</em>) though more general (i.e. it works for conversion to any base) is a bit harder to understand why it works.  The second method, (<em>Descending Powers of Two and Subtraction</em>)  is easier to understand and is in tandem with the <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/youtube/rVIq_bol1Es" target="_blank">video</a> you watched earlier.  Choose one of the methods described and come up with a simple algorithm for this procedure.</li>

<li>Examine the student file <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/4-internet/BinaryClock_Student.xml" target="_blank">linked here</a> with which you will be working. Note that 3 sprites representing the decimal digits, 8 sprites representing the binary digits, with all the necessary code and costumes have been created for you.  To see the actual costumes, you will need to go to the Costumes area for each sprite.  Another sprite representing the “Timer” has also been created for you.  <code>getBinaryDigits</code> block in this sprite is the only place where you will need to fill in some code. </li>

</ol>
</div>

           
<p>In this project you will generate the binary number representation of decimal numbers 0 through 255.  While it takes 3 digits to represent 255 in base 10, it will require 8 digits in base 2.  (Why?)  </p>

<p>If you look at the Timer sprite code, you will see that Snap<em>!</em>’s own “timer” block (from the “Sensing” menu) is used as a time keeper.  The decimal and binary digits are computed and stored in lists and then a broadcast is made to the sprites representing the digits to put on the appropriate costumes (0 and 1 for the binary digits and 0 through 9 for the decimal digits)<br>

</p>
The “warp” block is used to ensure that all the computation within the block is finalized prior to the refreshing of the screen .<br><br>
The code for extracting the base 10 digits of a given number,<code>getDecimalDigits</code>, is written for you. If you are using method 2 (<em>Descending Powers of Two and Subtraction</em>) to write <code>getBinaryDigits</code> you can ignore the code in <code>getDecimalDigits</code>.  If you are using method 1 (<em>Short Division by Two with Remainder</em>) however, you can use this code as a model to write the <code>getBinaryDigits</code> code as it is based on method 1.  


 <div class="forYouToDo" id="second">
       
			<ol start="4">

<li>Now review and understand the code for the rest of the sprites representing the decimal digits.  Check that your timer works in the decimal notation.</li>

<li>Now write the code for the <code>getBinaryDigits</code> custom block using either conversion method.  If you get stuck, you can get some hints here.  When you are done review the code for the sprites representing the 8 binary digits. Check that the timer works in the binary notation. </li>

			</ol>
		</div>
 <div class="takeItFurther">
 <ol>
 <li>Create a binary clock that keeps track of the current time.  For example:<br>
<div align="center">
Hours:Minutes:Seconds<br>
07: 40 : 16<br>
0111: 101000 : 010000<br>
</div>
Make use of the following “current” time block in the “Sensing” menu:<br>
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/img_BinaryClock/CurrentTime.png" width="25%" alt=""/><br>
</li>

<li>Create a hexadecimal clock that shows current time in base 16.
<div align="center">
Hours:Minutes:Seconds<br>
12: 40 : 59 <br>
C : 28 : 3B<br>
</div>
</li>
<li>Create a clock that shows the current time in Roman numerals.<br>
<div align="center">
Hours:Minutes:Seconds<br>
08 : 42 : 18<br>
VIII : XLII : XVIII<br>
</div>
Try to do this without introducing 60 different costumes.
</li>
<li>Create a Snap<em>!</em> program that converts any number in any given base to its equivalent in another given base.  The dialog with the user may be something like this:<br>
<div align="center">
Input the initial base: 10<br>
Input the number: 29<br>
Input the final base: 3<br>
29 in base 10 is 1002 in base 3.<br>
</div>
</li>
<li>Rewrite the “getBinaryDigits” and “getDecimalDigits” blocks in this project using recursion.</li>
</ol>
