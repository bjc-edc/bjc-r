		<h2>Binary Counter</h2>
		<p>In this project you will create a timer that reports the number of seconds elapsed in both decimal and binary notations.<br />
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    First, review the Binary Counter Snap<em>!</em> project you saw on the first page of the lab:<br />
                    <img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/bin-timer-preview.gif" alt="binary coutner Snap! project" title="binary coutner Snap! project"/>
				</li>	
                <li>Review the <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Convert-from-Decimal-to-Binary" target="_blank">examples presented here</a> and discuss how you can convert a number in base 10 to its equivalent in base 2.</li>
                <div class="endnote">
                    Note that there are two methods presented in the link.
                    <ol>
                        <li>The first method (<em>Short Division by Two with Remainder</em>), though more general (i.e. it works for conversion to any base) is a bit harder to understand why it works.</li>
                        <li>The second method, (<em>Descending Powers of Two and Subtraction</em>)  is easier to understand and is in tandem with the <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/youtube/rVIq_bol1Es" target="_blank">video</a> you watched earlier.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Choose one of the methods described and come up with a simple algorithm for this procedure.
                </div>
                <li>Examine the student file <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/4-internet/U4L1-BinaryClock.xml" target="_blank">linked here</a> with which you will be working. Several sprites, blocks, and costumes have already been created for you. The <code>getBinaryDigits</code> block is the only place where you will need to fill in some code. </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

           
        <div class="sidenoteBig">In this project, you will generate the binary number representation of decimal numbers 0 through 255.  While it takes 3 digits to represent 255 in base 10, it will require 8 digits in base 2. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Can you say why?</div></div>
        <p>
            If you look at the Timer sprite code, you will see that the <code>timer</code> block (from the "Sensing" menu) is used as a time keeper.  The decimal and binary digits are computed and stored in lists, and then a broadcast is made to the sprites representing the digits to put on the appropriate costumes (0 and 1 for the binary digits and 0 through 9 for the decimal digits.)<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/img_BinaryClock/TimerCode.png" width="30%"  alt="Timer Code" title="Timer Code"/>
        </p>
        <p>The "warp" block is used to ensure that all the computation within the block is completed prior to the refreshing of the screen .</p>
        <p>The code for extracting the base 10 digits of a given number,<code>getDecimalDigits</code>, is written for you. If you are using method 2 (<em>Descending Powers of Two and Subtraction</em>) to write <code>getBinaryDigits</code> you can ignore the code in <code>getDecimalDigits</code>.  If you are using method 1 (<em>Short Division by Two with Remainder</em>) however, you can use this code as a model to write the <code>getBinaryDigits</code> code as it is based on method 1.  </p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="second">
            <ol start="4">
                <li>Review and understand the code for the rest of the sprites representing the decimal digits.  Check that your timer works in the decimal notation.</li>
                <li>Now write the code for the <code>getBinaryDigits</code> custom block using either conversion method.  If you get stuck, you can get some <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-number-representation/4-binary-counter-hints.html" target="_blank"> hints here</a>.  When you are done, review the code for the sprites representing the 8 binary digits. Check that the timer works in the binary notation. </li>

                    Create a binary clock that keeps track of the current time.  For example:<br />
                    <div align="center">
                    Hours : Minutes : Seconds<br />
                    07 : 40 : 16<br />

                    </div>
                    Make use of the following <code>current</code> time block in the "Sensing" menu:<br />

                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a hexadecimal clock that shows current time in base 16.
                    <div align="center">
                        Hours : Minutes : Seconds<br />
                        12 : 40 : 59 <br />
                        C : 28 : 3B<br />

                    Create a clock that shows the current time in Roman numerals.<br />

                <li>
                    Create a Snap<em>!</em> program that converts any number in any given base to its equivalent in another given base.  The dialog with the user may be something like this:<br />
                    <div align="center">
                        Input the initial base: 10<br />
                        Input the number: 29<br />
                        Input the final base: 3<br />
                        Output: 29 in base 10 is 1002 in base 3<br />
