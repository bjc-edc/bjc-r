            2.1.1D Number bases, including binary, decimal, and hexadecimal, are used to represent and investigate digital data.<br />
            2.1.1E At one of the lowest levels of abstraction, digital data is represented in binary (base 2) using only combinations of the digits zero and one.<br />

		<p>Whereas people typically work with numbers using the base 10 numeral system, other systems are relevant in computer science, including binary (base 2) and hexadecimal (base 16). Although computers interface with people using decimal numerals, computers actually manage data (numbers, text, images, etc.) in binary sequences of ones and zeros.</p>
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p>In <strong>base 10</strong>, there are ten digits (0-9), and the place values go by powers of 10: ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.</p>
            <p>In <strong>binary, base 2</strong>, there are only two digits (0 and 1), and the place values go by powers of 2: ones, twos, fours, eights, sixteens, etc.</p>

        <h3>Reading Binary</h3>
		<p>
        	Here's a video from a different version of BJC. It cuts off just before talking about base 16. (You'll see more about reading hexadecimal soon.)<br />

        <div class="sidenote">If your connection blocks YouTube, <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/youtube/SqhbDWVOLvk" target="_blank">watch the video here</a>, but you only need to watch the first 3:10&mdash;up to (but not including) the part about hexadecimal. </div>

        <p>In <strong>decimal</strong> notation, each place value represents a <strong>power of ten</strong>: the units place (10<sup>0</sup> = 1), the tens place (10<sup>1</sup> = 10), the hundreds place (10<sup>2</sup> = 100), the thousands place (10<sup>3</sup> = 1000), etc. So, for example:</p>
    	<!--<div class="sidenote">The symbol "XVIII" in Roman numerals  represents the same number as the decimal representation "18." In binary, we write "10010" for "18," but it's still the same number. So there's no such thing as a "binary number," just binary <em>representation.</em></div>-->
		<p class="center"> 9827  &nbsp; = &nbsp; 9 &times;  10<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 8 &times;  10<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 2 &times;  10<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 7 &times;  10<sup>0</sup></p>
		<p><strong>Binary</strong> uses the same idea but with <strong>powers of two</strong> instead of powers of ten. Binary place values represent: the units place (2<sup>0</sup> = 1), the twos place (2<sup>1</sup> = 2), the fours place (2<sup>2</sup> = 4), the eights place (2<sup>3</sup> = 8), sixteens place (2<sup>4</sup> = 16), etc. So, for example:</p>
        <p align="center">10010<sub>2</sub> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <span class="blue">1 &times; 2<sup>4</sup></span>	 &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0 &times; 2<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0 &times; 2<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; <span class="blue">1 &times; 2<sup>1</sup></span> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0 &times; 2<sup>0</sup> &nbsp; = &nbsp; 16 &nbsp;+&nbsp; 2 &nbsp; = &nbsp; 18<sub>10</sub></p>
        <div class="endnote">The subscript <em>2</em> in 10010<sub>2</sub> means the 10010 is in <em>binary</em>. The subscript <em>10</em> in 18<sub>10</sub> means the 18 is in <em>decimal</em>.</div>

                        <!--<li>It would be helpful if there were<strong> some small binary numbers to translate. Instead of writing numbers with lead zeroes (we don't do that with decimal numbers, do we?), just write the binary number.

Instead, the first part of #7 is 10000111 base 2, and that could be a load for a lot of students.</li>-->
