    	<h2>GPS Coordinates</h2>
        <p>Big Burgers is coming to New York City. To  figure out where to put their first new restaurant, the  restaurant chain put up signs asking people to send their home's location. People  used GPS coordinates.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
          <ol>
                <li> The set of GPS coordinates that Big Burgers received is <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-gps-data/GPS-NYC.csv">in this file</a>. Look through the file. About how many people contributed their information? How much information is on each line? </li> <div class="todo">PG: I'm having trouble editing to clarify for several reasons. One is that I can't tell what kids'll see when the click the file link. In Q2, they read into Snap, but in Q1, they're presumably already seeing something. Also, we need a believable way for people to "send their home's location" using GPS coordinates. Does anyone <em>know</em> their coordinates? Q4 asks what information is in the data, but that's already been said above. If this is asking for something more precise, how can I know the answer?  Why, given the purpose of the lab, would we not <em>start</em> with a list of two-item lists? (One good answer would be if kids were practicing scraping a site and using split and map, but they're not scraping a site.) </div>
                <li> Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/proxied-http.png" alt="Proxied HTTP block"> block to read this file into <span class="snap">snap</span>.</li>
            </ol>

		<p>The file is read in as a very long string, but it can be changed into a list of two-item lists:</p>
