    	<h2>GPS Coordinates</h2>
        <p>Big Burgers is coming to New York City. To  figure out where to put their first new restaurant, the restaurant chain put up signs asking people to use their phones at home to send their location. These locations were recorded using GPS coordinates.</p>

				<li> How many people reported their location?</li>
            </ol>
