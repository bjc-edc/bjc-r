    	<h2>GPS Coordinates</h2>
        <p>Big Burgers is coming to New York City. To  figure out where to put their first new restaurant, the restaurant chain put up signs asking people to use their phones at home to send their location. These locations were recorded using GPS coordinates.</p>
        <div class="comment">PG: Everything fine except problem 1, which too many levels of redirection for <em>me</em> to follow. Problem 1 says &quot;follow instructions from Lab 1 to read the GPS coords....&quot; but L1 doesn't give "instructions...to read the GPS coordinates into a list...." That page's first instruction refers me to yet something else, telling me to load my U4L1-HttpBlock project and then to save it as U4L2-GPSData. Is <em>that</em>  what I should be loading here? If so, let problem 1 (here) say &quot;Load your U4L2-GPSData project&quot; so that I don't have to wade through L1  and remain (as I am) still unsure what I should be doing.   If that's <em>not</em> what I should load here (I'm not sure), I need clearer instructions here. </div>
