    	<h2>Analyzing GPS Data</h2>
<p>Big Burgers wants to answer this key question: <em>where should the new restaurant be?</em> By visualizing the 223 data points, they've learned new information about their customers.</p>

<div class=forYouToDo id="first">
<ol><li>Import the <code>average</code> block you built in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/3-three-key-list-ops/4-combine.html">Unit 3</a> into your current project:
<ul>
<li>Starting from the Unit 3 project, in Snap<em>!</em>, choose "Export blocks..." from the File menu.</li>
<li>Right-click on any check mark and choose "none" to de-select all the blocks, then hit OK.</li>
<li>Find and click on the <code>average</code> block, then click OK. This will generate an XML file.</li>
<li>In your current project, choose "Import..." from the File menu, then select the XML file you just generated.</li>
<li>The <code>average</code> block should now be usable in your current project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the <code>average</code> block to compute the average latitude and average longitude of the GPS data.</li>
<li>Plot the average as a new data point using the same scaling as the other points.</li>
<li>Would this be a good location for the restaurant? Explain.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class=comment>BK: I wonder if "40.70" would be better than "40.7" in the graphic here. Both are correct.</div>

<p>Here's a visualization of the GPS data, along with some latitude lines for reference. The GPS data breaks into three clear zones:</p>

<img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/GPS-map.png" alt="GPS data plus latitude lines">

<p>Based on the visualization, Big Burgers will place their restaurant in the zone with the largest number of customers. But, which one is it? <div class="sidenote">Taking a large data set and breaking it into smaller groups is called <strong>cluster analysis</strong>. Visualizations of data are especially helpful in identifying and classifying clusters.</div></p>

<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="5">
<li>Given a specific pair of GPS coordinates, how might you decide which of the three zones it is in?</li>
<li>Create a <code>zone</code> block. The input is a pair of GPS coordinates, and the output indicates which zone the coordinates are in.</li>
<li>Use the <code>zone</code> block and the full set of GPS data to determine which of the three zones has the most customers.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Now that Big Burgers knows the general area to place the restaurant, they still need to determine where <em>within that zone</em> to place it. To do this, they need a new list of the GPS coordinates of those customers within that zone.</p>

<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="8">
<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />What blocks might be helpful here?</li>
<li>Use the <code>average</code> block to compute the average of all the longitudes and latitudes of the GPS data <strong>within the most popular zone</strong>.</li>
<li>On a map, find the location where the data says the restaurant should be located. What practical limitations might there be to this analysis?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="ifTime">
<ol start="11">
<li>Big Burgers decides they can open two restaurants in New York. Where should the second restaurant be located?</li>
</ol>
