        <p>Let's look closer at the first GPS coordinates in the Big Burgers data. The coordinates are <i>40.8,-73.94</i>. GPS coordinates describe a location on Earth by two numbers, a <strong>latitude</strong> (north-south) and a <strong>longitude</strong> (east-west).	
   	<div class="sidenoteBig">It's not necessary, but if you are interested, read this or another quick introduction on GPS coordinates: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2209240_read-gps-coordinates.html">E-How Tutorial on GPS coordinates</a>. And/or, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQdIjwoi-u4" target="_blank">video on GPS &amp; Relativity</a>.  
            	<div class="todo">I  like the video, and I know that theoretical physics departments are now populated nearly solely by white male nerdlings. But the message, given this way, helps perpetuate that. It pretty much says "no &lt;fill in  blank&gt; need apply." :-(  PG<br />Paul, I, in no way, disagree with you, but the trouble is that many of the great stuff out there (in math, cs, and physics) <em>has</em> been done by white male nerdlings. So, what should we do? Clearly, code.org folks have been sensitive to that. Should we look for something comparable to this highlighting contributions by a more diverse group? (Yes, obviously.) Any suggestions, anyone? --MF</div>

                <li>GPS coordinates <i>40.8, -73.94</i> give a location in New York City. Is the latitude 40.8 north or south? North or south of what?</li>
                <li>The longitude -73.94 indicates New York City is <em>west</em> of longitude 0. How might the longitude of Chicago compare to this number? </li>

GPS coordinates on a map are "backwards" compared to the way Snap<em>!</em> plots points. In Snap<em>!</em>, and in mathematics, the first coordinate is plotted horizontally, and the second vertically. However, this isn't the order GPS gives.

        <div class="takeNote"> When <em>writing</em> GPS coordinates, the first number is <em>latitude</em>, measures north-south, and the second, <em>longitude</em>, measures east-west. <strong>When plotting GPS coordinates, plot them as (longitude, latitude), reversing the written order.</strong></div >
    
        <h3>Visualizing the Big Burger data</h3>
        <p>
            GPS data isn't very useful as a list; more information is communicated through <em>visualizing</em> the data.</p>

<p>Note that the background of the stage is set to an <em>x</em>-<em>y</em> grid and that the sprite's costume is a black circle.

                <li>
					
					  Write a script that plots all 223 GPS coordinates on the graph. Use <code>stamp</code> to plot the locations as black circles. What does it look like?

        <div class="sidenoteBig">You can do it your own way instead if you like.</div>    
        <p>To see the variation in the GPS coordinates, you'll need to <em>transform</em> them. Transforming data and information can lead to new knowledge and new means to communicate it. These problems will lead you through one way to transform the GPS coordinates.</p>

                <div class="sidenote">Subtracting -74 is the same as adding 74.</div>
                <li>Every point's longitude is around -74 and every point's latitude is around 40.7. This does not help us tell the points apart. Subtract -74 from every longitude and subtract 40.7 from every latitude, using a <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">list operation</a>.</li>

                <li>The data is still too close together. Change your list operation so that, after subtracting, the new values are multiplied by a factor. Adjust this factor and replot until you can see the shape of the data. What does the plot tell you about the GPS information?</li>

                <li>Use multiplication factors so that the data can be properly visualized. How could you use Snap<em>!</em> to automatically determine the multiplication factor?</li>
