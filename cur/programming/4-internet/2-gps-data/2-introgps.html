            Let's look closer at the first GPS coordinates in the Big Burgers data. The coordinates are <i>40.8,-73.94</i>. GPS coordinates describe a location on Earth by two numbers, a <strong>latitude</strong> (north-south) and a <strong>longitude</strong> (east-west).	
            <div class="sidenoteBig">
                It's not necessary, but if you are interested, read this or another quick introduction on GPS coordinates: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2209240_read-gps-coordinates.html">E-How Tutorial on GPS coordinates</a>. And/or, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQdIjwoi-u4" target="_blank">video on GPS &amp; Relativity</a>.  
                <div class="todo">
                  <p>I  like the video, and I know that theoretical physics departments are now populated nearly solely by white male nerdlings. But the message, given this way, helps perpetuate that. It pretty much says "no &lt;fill in  blank&gt; need apply." :-(  PG<br />Paul, I, in no way, disagree with you, but the trouble is that many of the great stuff out there (in math, cs, and physics) <em>has</em> been done by white male nerdlings. So, what should we do? Clearly, code.org folks have been sensitive to that. Should we look for something comparable to this highlighting contributions by a more diverse group? (Yes, obviously.) Any suggestions, anyone? --MF</p>
                  <p>Yes, I suggest just flushing this entire yellow box (and the one below about Google Earth). First of all, we've agreed not to throw in links to third party web sites unless necessary. Second, that GPS tutorial will horribly confuse students because it says GPS coordinates are represented as degrees, minutes, and seconds of arc, whereas the coordinates we give students are just in degrees! And third, not so important for our purposes, but the text is inaccurate; it says that the Date Line is at 180 degrees, which is only approximately true. And, geez, you really want to throw general relativity at our students? --bh</p>

        <h3>Visualizing the Big Burgers data</h3>
        <p>GPS data isn't very useful as a list; more information is communicated through <em>visualizing</em> the data.</p>

            <ol start="4">
                <li>
                	<strong>Choose one</strong> of the following:
                    <ul>

                            Add a background and change the sprite costume for your U4L2-GPSData project:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Open your U4L2-GPSData project.</li>
                                <li>Change the stage's background to "XY Grid" (click the Stage button; choose "Backgrounds" from the File menu; and choose "XY Grid").</li>
                                <li>Change the sprite costume (click the sprite, click the "Costumes tab," click the paintbrush, select the ellipse tool, press and hold the shift key to draw a small circle, click the "set rotation center" button <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/rotation-center.png" alt="Set the Rotation Center" title="Set the Rotation Center" /> once to mark the center of the sprite).</li>

                        </li>

        <p>To see the variation in the GPS coordinates, you'll need to <em>transform</em> them. Transforming data and information can lead to new knowledge and new means to communicate it.
