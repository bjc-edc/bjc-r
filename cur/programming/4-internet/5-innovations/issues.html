        	<li>What issues or problems do you see in the world around you? List a few issues (they can be big or small) that you care about. Here are some sentence starters that might help (you don't have to use them):
            <ul>
            	<li>In a perfect world, there wouldn't be...</li>
                <li>I get upset/mad every time I think about...</li>
                <li>The world can be so unfair - I care about issues that affect...</li>
                <li>The world would be better if we could...</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What are some ways that technology might be used to address some of these issues?</li>
            <li>What are some things technology <em>can't</em> do to address some of these issues?</li>

        <div class="todo">JK: On the next page, have kids choose one issue they want to do some research into. What technologies do you know of (or have you heard of) that are working to address some of these issues? Later, too, have a section where kids think of unintended consequences of their good innovations.
