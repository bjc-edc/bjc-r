    	<h2>Symmetric Cryptography</h2>
        <div class="todo">
	        6.3.1K Symmetric encryption is a method of encryption involving one key for encryption and decryption.<br />
        </div>
        <div class="sidenote">Imagine a pair of wheels, pinned together at their center, but free to rotate independently like this:<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/wheel.png" alt="decoder ring" title="decoder ring" /> </div> 
        <p>
            You might have used a <strong>substitution cipher</strong> to encode your message, substituting each letter of the alphabet with some other letter. You could substitute letters in any order, like this:
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</div>
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">PQVFUBZOTHWYELIXRNAMGDSCKJ</div>
            That's called a <strong>general substitution cipher</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Or you might just <em>shift</em> the letters in order. For example, this is a shift of 3:
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</div>
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC</div> 
            That's called a <strong>Caesar Cipher</strong> (named for Julius Caesar) or a <strong>shift cipher</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Substitution ciphers are examples of symmetric encryption because they use the same key for both encryption and decryption.</p>

                    Even a general substitution cipher is relatively easy to break because some letters are used more frequently than others.
