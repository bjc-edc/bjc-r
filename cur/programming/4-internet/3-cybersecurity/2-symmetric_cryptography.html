    	<h2>Symmetric Cryptography</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn a simple method of symmetric encryption.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Confusing because it's only about the shift cipher, and also we aren't making it clear how this is used (e.g., it's not turned while you are decrypting or encrypting. --BH and MF
        <div class="sidenote">
            Imagine a pair of wheels, pinned together at their center but free to rotate independently like this:<br />
            <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/wheel.png" alt="decoder ring" title="decoder ring" /> 
        </div> -->
        <p>
            You might have used a <strong>substitution cipher</strong> to encode your message, substituting each letter of the alphabet with some other letter. You could substitute letters in any order, like this:
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</div>
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">PQVFUBZOTHWYELIXRNAMGDSCKJ<img class="noshadow nopad" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/this-is-the-key.jpg" alt="This is the key." title="This is the key." /></div>
            That's called a <strong>simple substitution cipher</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            An easier way is to just <em>shift</em> the letters in order. For example, this is a shift of 3:
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</div>
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC<img class="noshadow nopad" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/this-is-the-key.jpg" alt="This is the key." title="This is the key." /></div> 
            That's a special kind of simple substitution cipher called a <strong>Caesar Cipher</strong> (named for Julius Caesar) or a <strong>shift cipher</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="takeNote">Substitution ciphers are examples of <strong>symmetric encryption</strong> because they use the <em>same key</em> for both encryption and decryption. There are more complicated methods of symmetric encryption, but they always use the same key.</div>
        <div class="endnote">Up through the 1970s, symmetric encryption was all people had, but they used much more complicated algorithms than substitution ciphers. These days, simple substitution ciphers are used as puzzles in magazines, but breaking the German Enigma cipher in World War II, which you'll learn about in Unit 5, took a building full of mathematicians and computing equipment.</div>

                    A simple substitution cipher is relatively easy to break because some letters are used more frequently than others.
