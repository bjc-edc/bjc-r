		<p>Originally, network security was a relatively minor consideration because the Arpanet was a small computer network of military personnel and university users. The real need for security arose once businesses were allowed on the Internet in 1995.</p>
        <div class="takeNote">Too much security has its own set of problems. A perfectly secure Internet could easily end up preventing anonymous publishing.  To prevent fraud, it's important to be able to verify the source of a message. But if the source of a message can be verified, the message can't be anonymous. That's problematic both for privacy and for freedom of speech.</div>

		<h3>The Lack of DNS Security</h3>
        <p>The hierarchy of the DNS makes the system more efficient. When you visit <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" title="Snap! Build Your Own Blocks">snap.berkeley.edu</a>, your computer only has to know where to find an <em>edu</em> name server. That server only has to know where to find the <em>berkeley.edu</em> server. And that server directs your computer to <em>snap.berkeley.edu</em>.</p>
        <!--<div class="sidenote">You learned about root domain servers on the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-reliable-communication/3-address-hierarchy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Address Hierarchy
">Address Hierarchy</a> page.</div>-->
        <p>There are millions of such DNS requests every second, and if all of those requests had to begin at the same few root domain servers, those servers would be flooded with too many requests. Instead, DNS servers remember (<em>cache</em>) the results of host name queries, and they provide these remembered (<em>non-authoritative</em>) answers for most requests. However, if the IP address of the site you are requesting <em>changes</em> before before the non-authoritative answer is updated, you may be sent to the wrong site. More critically, a fraudulent DNS server may provide deliberately wrong non-authoritative answers. DNS was not designed to be perfectly secure. </p>

		<h3>Common Security Issues for Users</h3>
        <p>Software has <em>bugs</em> (even finished software written by professionals).  And people can use those bugs for bad purposes (such as crashing your computer or implanting spy software to collect everything you type, including passwords).  Software developers try to prevent security bugs and fix them when they turn up, but not every software developer distributes fixes promptly. (And not every computer user keeps up with software updates perfectly!)</p>
		<p>The general name for programs that try to affect your computer badly is <em>malware</em>. One kind of malware is called a <em>virus</em>.  Computer viruses make copies of themselves (just as biological viruses do) and try to spread themselves over the network to other computers. People use <em>antivirus software</em> to help prevent these attacks. People also use <em>firewalls</em> to limit connections into or out of their computer. (Both your computer and your router probably run firewall software.)</p>
        <p>Another common attack strategy is called <em>phishing:</em> an attacker sends you an email that appears to be from some official organization (such as your bank) and tricks you into giving information to the attackers (such as your bank password).</p>

                <li><strong>Antivirus software</strong> is software designed to scan the files on your computer and delete or "quarantine" files that are infected with a virus.</li>
                <li>A <strong>firewall</strong> is a security system that controls the kinds of connections that can be made between a computer or network and the outside world.</li>
                <li><strong>Phishing</strong> is a common security attack in which the victim is tricked into giving up personal information or downloading malware.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
		
        
        <h3>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack</h3>
        <p>A <em>Denial of Service</em> (DoS) attack consists of sending a lot of requests to a server at the same time (for instance, requests for a web page or some data). This can overload the server's network bandwidth. A DoS attack doesn't destroy data or collect passwords; it just causes a temporary inability to reach the targeted server so other users of that server are denied service.</p>
        <div class="vocabBig">
        	<p>A <strong>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack</strong> uses a virus to flood a server with many requests from many computers at once so that users of that server are denied service.</p>
        </div>
        <p>A variant is the <em>Distributed Denial of Service</em> (DDoS) attack, in which the attacker first uses viruses to take control of many (sometimes tens of thousands of) computers around the world. This network of infected computers is called a <em>botnet</em>. The attacker then launches a DoS attack from all of the victims' computers at the same time. Besides increasing the number of simultaneous server requests, DDoS makes it harder to determine who is at fault, since the attack seems to come from many innocent people.</p>
