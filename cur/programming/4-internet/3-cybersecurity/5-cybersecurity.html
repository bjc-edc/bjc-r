            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn about threats to online security.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Originally, network security was a relatively minor consideration because the Arpanet was a small computer network of military personnel and university users. The real need for security arose once businesses were allowed on the Internet in 1995.</p>
        <div class="takeNote">Too much security has its own set of problems. A perfectly secure Internet could easily end up preventing anonymous publishing.  To prevent fraud, it's important to be able to verify the source of a message. But if the source of a message can be verified, the message can't be anonymous. That's problematic both for privacy and for freedom of speech.</div>

        <h3>Who Wants to Attack Other People's Computers?</h3>
        <div class="todo">New section from BH needs review. --MF, 2/1/18</div>
		<p>In the early days of the Internet, most attacks came from teenagers, who wanted to learn about the insides of computer software, feel smart, and show off to their friends. Most of the time, they didn't <em>intend</em> to do any harm, but often they did anyway, partly by making mistakes, and partly by convincing computer system managers that the early open-access network policies were dangerous.</p>
        <p>That was before computer systems on the Internet became important to people other than their owners. Today, people give their credit card numbers to online shopping sites, and computers controlling <em>infrastructure</em> (such as power plants, telephone switching systems, traffic lights, and hospital equipment) can be attacked by other countries' military. (The United States has been both the attacker and the attacked in this sort of incident.)	There are still teenagers having fun by attacking computers, but today such cases are far outnumbered by serious criminals and cyber-warriors.</p>
        
        <h3>Common Security Issues for Users</h3>
        <p>Software has <em>bugs</em> (even finished software written by professionals).  And people can use those bugs for bad purposes (such as crashing your computer or implanting spy software to collect everything you type, including passwords).  Software developers try to prevent security bugs and fix them when they turn up, but not every software developer distributes fixes promptly. (And not every computer user keeps up with software updates perfectly!)</p>
		<p>The general name for programs that try to affect your computer badly is <em>malware</em>. One kind of malware is called a <em>virus</em>.  Computer viruses make copies of themselves (just as biological viruses do) and try to spread themselves over the network to other computers. People use <em>antivirus software</em> to help prevent these attacks. People also use <em>firewalls</em> to limit connections into or out of their computer. (Both your computer and your router probably run firewall software.)</p>
        <p>Another common attack strategy is called <em>phishing:</em> an attacker sends you an email that appears to be from some official organization (such as your bank) and tricks you into giving information to the attackers (such as your bank password).</p>
        
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">

                    <p>malware: IOC-2.B.9</p>
                    <p>virus: IOC-2.B.8</p>
                    <p>antivirus or anti-malware software: IOC-2.B.7</p>
                </div>
                <li><strong>Malware</strong> is software that was designed to harm or take partial control over your computer.</li>
                <li>A <strong>comptuer virus</strong> is a type of malware that spreads and infects other computers. Viruses can attach themselves to legitimate programs.</li>
                <li><strong>Antivirus or anti-malware software</strong> is software designed to scan the files on your computer and delete or "quarantine" files that are infected.</li>
                <li>A <strong>firewall</strong> is a security system that controls the kinds of connections that can be made between a computer or network and the outside world.</li>
                <li><strong>Phishing</strong> is a common security attack in which the victim is tricked into giving up personal information or downloading malware.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        
        <h3>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack</h3>
        <p>A <em>Denial of Service</em> (DoS) attack consists of sending a lot of requests to a server at the same time (for instance, requests for a web page or some data). This can overload the server's network bandwidth. A DoS attack doesn't destroy data or collect passwords; it just causes a temporary inability to reach the targeted server so other users of that server are denied service.</p>
        <div class="vocabBig">
        	<p>A <strong>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack</strong> uses a virus to flood a server with many requests from many computers at once so that users of that server are denied service.</p>
        </div>
        <p>A variant is the <em>Distributed Denial of Service</em> (DDoS) attack, in which the attacker first uses viruses and other malware to take control of many (sometimes hundreds of thousands of) computers around the world. This network of infected computers is called a <em>botnet</em>. The attacker then launches a DoS attack from all of the victims' computers at the same time. Besides increasing the number of simultaneous server requests, DDoS makes it harder to determine who is at fault, since the attack seems to come from many innocent people.</p>
                
        <h3>The Lack of DNS Security</h3>
        <p>The hierarchy of the DNS makes the system more efficient. When you visit <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" title="Snap! Build Your Own Blocks">snap.berkeley.edu</a>, your computer only has to know where to find an <em>edu</em> name server. That server only has to know where to find the <em>berkeley.edu</em> server. And that server directs your computer to <em>snap.berkeley.edu</em>.</p>
        <!--<div class="sidenote">You learned about root domain servers on the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-reliable-communication/3-address-hierarchy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Address Hierarchy">Address Hierarchy</a> page.</div>-->
        <p>There are millions of such DNS requests every second, and if all of those requests had to begin at the same few root domain servers, those servers would be flooded with too many requests. Instead, DNS servers remember (<em>cache</em>) the results of host name queries, and they provide these remembered (<em>non-authoritative</em>) answers for most requests. However, if the IP address of the site you are requesting <em>changes</em> before before the non-authoritative answer is updated, you may be sent to the wrong site. More critically, a fraudulent DNS server may provide deliberately wrong non-authoritative answers. DNS was not designed to be perfectly secure.</p>

        <h3>What Can You Do?</h3>

            There are no perfect solutions you as an individual person can use to be sure you will never be victimized.  But there are things you can do that will help a lot:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Run up-to-date software.</strong> The Windows 98 operating system was not sold after 2000, and not supported after 2006.  But there are <em>still</em> computers running this obsolete system, including many in the US Department of Defense.<a href="https://windowsreport.com/windows-95-98-pentagon/" target="_blank">[source]</a> Usually, when people keep using obsolete systems, it's because they rely on application software that runs only in the old system.</li>
                <li>
                    <div class="comment">IOC-2.B.1</div>
                    Use authentication to protect devices and information from unauthorized access. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <div class="vocabBig">
                            <div class="todo">IOC-2.B.2</div>
                            <p>A <strong>strong password</strong> is one that is easy to remember but hard for someone else to guess.</p>
                        </div>
                        <li><strong>Use strong passwords.</strong> You need a separate password for every site you use, and if a password is easy for you to remember, it's also easy for criminals to find in the dictionary.  The only good solution is to use a <em>password manager,</em> a program that makes up a random password for every site.  You just remember one password, the one for the password manager itself.  It takes care of your other ones for you.  </li>  
                        <div class="comment">IOC-2.B.3, IOC-2.B.4</div>
                        <li><strong>Enable multifactor authentication</strong> (such as two-factor authentication) so you can only access your device or account after entering specific information (such as a code that comes through another of your devices or accounts). It may feel like a hassle, but each step added to the login progress adds another layer of security. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Don't click links</strong> on web sites or (especially) in email, without first double-checking that the actual URL in the link is the same as the one that's shown in the message.  (Where does this link to <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">http://google.com</a> really send you?)    Two paragraphs up we said to keep your software up-to-date, and often the way you know there's an update is that a window pops up on your screen. Don't click the "update" button — or even the "close" button — unless you're sure it's really a legitimate update.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't use iffy software. </strong>If the advertising says that the program will get you money, or free stuff, or pornography, or cheats for video games, it's very likely to be malware.  A particularly sneaky category is fake antivirus software!  Check the reviews in magazines to make sure you're getting what you really want.</li>
            </ol>
