            <p>BH: They already did Caesar cipher in U2 or someplace like that.  Can't we have an interesting one instead?</p>
            <p>Brian, I believe that is long gone. In the time available in the distant future, I think adding something "interesting" would be nice as a TIF or optional project. --MF, 8/5/19</p>

            The Caesar cipher is named after Gaius Julius Caesar, who ruled Rome 49-44 BC and used encryption in his correspondence.

            Computers store keyboard characters (capital and small letters, punctuation marks, space, digits, symbols, and so on) as numbers called Unicode. This table shows the Unicode for some of the keyboard characters:<br />
            <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/img_CaesarCipher/Mary_CharacterTable.jpeg" height="330px" alt="Unicode Table"/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The <code>unicode of</code> block reports the number that is used for a particular character:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/img_CaesarCipher/SnapUnicode1.png" height="52" alt="unicode of (a) reporting '97'" title="unicode of (a) reporting '97'" /><br />
            The <code>unicode as letter</code> block reports the character that a given Unicode number represents:<br /> 
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/img_CaesarCipher/SnapUnicode2.png" height="52"  alt="unicode (65) as letter reporting 'A'" title="unicode (65) as letter reporting 'A'" />

            <ol>
                <li>Experiment with the <code>unicode of</code> and <code>unicode as letter</code> blocks. Try changing a word into Unicode, telling the Unicode to a friend, and then having them change it back into a word.</li>

                        <p>You can safely assume that shifting any set of text characters a reasonable distance will result in a set of printable characters, which may include non-alphanumeric (not letter or digit) characters.</p>
                        <p>For example, if we use a shift of 4 to encrypt:</p>

                        <p>it becomes:</p>

                                <li>In this code, 1 becomes 5 and 4 becomes 8, clearly showing the shift of 4. What does 9 become?</li>

                        <li>Develop an algorithm for this procedure that works for any input text and any shift value.</li>
                        <li>Try to code the shift cipher on your own in Snap<em>!</em> using the algorithm you have developed. If you get stuck, look at this <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-cybersecurity/old/3b-caesar-cipher-hint.html" title="Hints">page for hints </a>on how to proceed.</li>

                	You can extract the encrypted messages from the Snap<em>!</em> interface by right-clicking on the variable that holds the encrypted message and selecting the “Export” option which will download a text file to your computer which then you can copy/paste.<br />

                <li>Now test your work. Agree with your partner on a shift value for the encryption.  Then use your program to encrypt a secret message and e-mail it to your partner.  Then let your partner decrypt your message by using the program to reverse the shift.</li>

                        <p>If you copy your encrypted message with a method other than by using copy and paste (for example, by writing it by hand or typing it into a phone), some characters may disappear from your message. This is because some of the Unicode characters after 126 are printing characters that symbolize things like "delete." These characters won't get displayed in Snap<em>!</em>, so you can't copy them by hand, but if you use copy and paste, Snap<em>!</em> knows they are there. In Take It Further exercise A, you can develop a method of encryption that avoids this problem.</p>

                <li>Implement a version of the Caesar Cipher that not only shifts the characters but also wraps them around the alphabet when the end of the alphabet is reached.  You may wish to restrict your alphabet to the set of printable characters given above in the Unicode table.</li>
                <li>If you came across a long message encrypted in the Caesar Cipher but did not know the shift value, what are some ways you might be able to break the system and decrypt the message?  Discuss the weaknesses of a Caesar Cipher and how it is prone to breaking.</li>
                <li>Do some research on other types of ciphers used historically. Especially read about the Vigenere Cipher which was used extensively in communicating sensitive information during World War 2.</li>
