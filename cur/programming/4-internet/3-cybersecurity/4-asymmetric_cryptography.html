        <div class="todo">I added the pink box, moved one sentence out of the first yellow box and into the white (and edited it), and made some yellow boxes hints. And I spell-checked. Yikes! :/ And I added a side comment about an image between #1 and #2. --MF, 12/21/17</div>

            6.3.1L Public key encryption, which is not symmetric, is an encryption method that is widely used because of the enhanced security associated with its use.<br />

            Selim agreed with all above.

		<p>Symmetric encryption has a fundamental weakness: the encryption method or key needs to be kept secret.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Keeping the key private is almost as hard as keeping the message private. In 1976 Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman devised an ingenious method (now known as RSA) that allows a person to announce publicly how anyone can encode a message to him  so that only he is able to decipher it. The information, which is given away to everybody, is called the <em>public key</em>. The information which is needed for deciphering (the <em>private key</em>) is known only by the person for whom the message is intended. If Bob wants to send Alice a secret message, he enciphers it with Alice's public key. Then no one else can decipher it, even knowing her public key. Only her private key can undo the encryption, and you <em>can't figure out</em> the private key from the public key.</div>

				<li>It may seem incredible that Alice can make her encryption key public and still no one except her can decrypt her message.  The public key method relies on some mathematics and on some limitations on the speed of current computers.

            <div id="hint-digital-signatures" class="collapse">That's no good for secret messages (why not?), but it's useful for <strong>digital signatures</strong>.  I use my private key to encrypt a message; you use my public key to decrypt it.  If you get a meaningful message as the result, that proves that the message was encrypted with my private key.  (If I want both secrecy and digital signing, I encrypt the message with my private key to sign it, then encrypt the encrypted result <em>again</em> with your public key to keep it secret. You decrypt it twice, first with your private key and then with my public key.) This is a nice example of <em>composition of functions:</em> the output from the first encryption is the input to the second encryption.</div>

        <h3>Secure HTTP</h3>
		<p>Secure HTTP connections (those that use <strong>https://</strong> instead of <strong>http://</strong>) use a protocol called <em>Transport Layer Security</em> (TLS) or maybe an older version called <em>Secure Sockets Layer</em> (SSL). Both are based on public key cryptography. With SSL/TLS, the site you are visiting sends its public key, and your browser uses it to encrypt the information you send.</p>

                <p>In order to work properly, a cryptographic function has to be easy for the private key holder to invert, but hard for anyone else to invert. How do we know what "hard" means? For example, current cryptographic methods rely on the difficulty of finding prime factors of very large numbers. There's no <em>proof</em> that someone won't come up with a fast way to do that, but people are pretty confident about it because the problem has been well studied by many mathematicians. (On the other hand, when <em>quantum computers</em> become practical, factorization <em>will</em> be easy, and new cryptographic methods will be needed.)</p>
                <p>What makes it possible for mathematicians to study the difficulty of breaking Internet cryptography is that the method used&mdash;the cryptographic function&mdash;is openly published. This may seem strange; if you want to keep secrets, shouldn't you keep the technique secret, too? But secret algorithms can have weaknesses that go undiscovered until some bad guy exploits them. Open standards allow an algorithm to be studied <em>before</em> it is used in practice.</p>

        <h3>Certificate Authorities</h3>
		<p>Public key cryptography doesn't solve all the problems, because someone might publish a fake public key pretending to be someone (say, Alice). Then someone might accidentally encrypt their message for Alice using the faker's key, and then the faker can read the message.  In practice, this is partly fixed by relying on trusted third parties, called Certificate Authorities, to <em>issue public keys</em>. In your browser's security options you can see all of the Certificate Authorities that it trusts.</p>
