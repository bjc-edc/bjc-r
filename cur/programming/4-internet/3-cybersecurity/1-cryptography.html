            <p>Cryptography is the study of how to convert messages into code (encryption) and how to solve codes (decryption). Just as TCP enables reliable transmission over an unreliable network, cryptography enables <em>verifiable</em>, <em>secure</em> transmission over an insecure network.</p>

        <p>
            You might have used a <em>substitution cipher</em> to encode your message, substituting each letter of the alphabet with some other letter. You could substitute letters in any order, like this:
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</div>
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">PQVFUBZOTHWYELIXRNAMGDSCKJ<img class="noshadow nopad" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/this-is-the-key.jpg" alt="This is the key." title="This is the key." /></div>
            That's called a <em>simple substitution cipher</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            An easier way is to just shift the letters in order. For example, this is a shift of 3:
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</div>
            <div class="indent fixedwidth">DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC<img class="noshadow nopad" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/this-is-the-key.jpg" alt="This is the key." title="This is the key." /></div> 
            That's a special kind of simple substitution cipher called a <em>Caesar Cipher</em> (named for Julius Caesar) or a <em>shift cipher</em>.
        </p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Symmetric Encryption</strong>
            <div class="comment">IOC-2.B.5</div>
            <p>Substitution ciphers are examples of <strong>symmetric encryption</strong> because they use the <em>same key</em> for both encryption and decryption.</p>

        <div class="endnote">

                There are more complicated methods of symmetric encryption, but they always use the same key.

            </p>
            <div id="hint-symmetric" class="collapse">Up through the 1970s, symmetric encryption was all people had, but they used much more complicated algorithms than substitution ciphers. These days, simple substitution ciphers are used as puzzles in magazines, but breaking the German Enigma cipher in World War II, which you'll learn about in Unit 5, took a building full of mathematicians and computing equipment.</div>

                    A simple substitution cipher is relatively easy to break because some letters are used more frequently than others.
