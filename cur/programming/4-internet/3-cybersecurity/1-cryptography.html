        <p>Cryptography is the study of how to convert messages into code (encryption) and how to solve codes (decryption). Just as TCP enables reliable transmission over an unreliable network, cryptography enables <em>verifiable</em>, <em>secure</em> transmission over an insecure network.</p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
            <p>A <strong>secure</strong> transmission can't be read if it is intercepted.</p>
            <p>A <strong>verifiable</strong> transmission is guaranteed to be from the person it claims to be from.</p>

        	<p><strong>Cryptography</strong> is the methods for encoding and decoding messages.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p><strong>Symmetric cryptography</strong>, uses the <em>same secret key</em> to encode and to decode a message. Symmetric cryptography has been around for thousands of years. The trouble with symmetric cryptography is that the key becomes another message that needs to be transmitted securely.</p> 
            <p><strong>Public key (asymmetric) cryptography</strong> was created by mathematicians in the 1970s.  It uses <em>two different keys</em> for encryption and decryption, so sharing the public encryption key doesn't give away the private decryption key. Public key encryption is the primary method of encryption today because of its high level of security.</p>
