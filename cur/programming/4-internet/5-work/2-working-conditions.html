            	<div class="sidenote">Here are some findings from a <a href="http://www.amanet.org/training/articles/the-latest-on-workplace-monitoring-and-surveillance.aspx" target="_blank" title="The Latest on Workplace Monitoring and Surveillance (AMA)">2007 Electronic Monitoring and Surveillance Survey</a>.</div>
            	<li>Here are some ways employers use technology to monitor their employees. What are some pros and cons of these policies?
                <ul>
                	<li>Block access to certain websites, like social media  (like Facebook or Twitter), game sites, or other sites they deem inappropriate or offensive.</li>
                    <li>Monitor email use of employees, including reading email messages.</li>
                    <li>Use video surveillance to prevent theft.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>On-demand businesses existed before the Internet, but technology has helped grow an ''on-demand economy.''   Many  on-demand companies  do not have regular employees, but  hire independent contractors. This gives workers great flexibility about when they work, but costs them  benefits   like sick-pay, health insurance, job stability, or unemployment  if they are fired.
                  <ul>
                	<li>Research  the on-demand economy. Here are some resources to get you started.

                      <ul>
                    	<li>On-demand workers know what they're signing up for, so they shouldn't be suing these companies for not getting benefits.</li>
                        <li>In general, you get better work out of people if they are dedicated and loyal to your company. Might it matter if a driver drives for both Uber and Lyft?</li>
                        <li>The on-demand economy just helps the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.</li>
                        <li>It is hard for a traditional company with employees to compete with the on-demand model.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
