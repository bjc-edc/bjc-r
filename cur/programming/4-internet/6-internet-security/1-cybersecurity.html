Please add whatever else you think we need here. --MF</span><br />
                ½ AV sw, <span style="color: #F00;">firewalls</span> help <span style="color: #00F;">BH, I don't know what a firewall is, so I didn't try to write about it. If you want to add something about it, that would be great. --MF</span><br />

		<p>There are many cybersecurity risks on the Internet. The various kinds of cyber warfare and cyber crime can have widespread and potentially devastating effects. Accessing risks and implementing protective measures for cybersecurity issues has software, hardware, and human components.</p>

        <h3>The Lack of DNS Security</h3>
		<div class="sidenote">Review or read more about <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-web-data/1-internet.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment#DNS">DNS in Lab 1</a>.</div>
        <p>DNS was not designed to be completely secure. Any DNS server can provide a <em>non-authoritative</em> address for any domain. (DNS <em>has to</em> work that way because otherwise every connection would have to go through the top-level node that provides <em>authoritative</em> addresses for .com, .edu, etc.)</p>
        <p>So, we all rely on every nameserver being honest, and sometimes they aren't. The trust model of the internet involves tradeoffs.</p>
		<div class="endnote">Examples: Governments use dishonest routing information to suppress certain sites inside their country.  Anyone can use dishonest routing information to sabotage a domain or to steal passwords by sending you to fake sites.</div>
        <p>The net protocols were designed back when hardly anyone was connected to the Internet and everyone trusted everyone else. Today, achieving both security and efficiency at the same time would require a major redesign of the entire protocol system.</p>
        <p>A secure Internet could easily end up preventing anonymous publishing.  To prevent fraud, it's important to be able to verify the source of a message. But if the source of a message can be verified, the message can't be anonymous.  That's problematic both for privacy and for freedom of speech.</p>


		<h3>Common Security Attacks on Users</h3>
        <p>Software has bugs (even finished software written by professionals).  And people can use those bugs for bad purposes (such as crashing your computer or implanting spy software to collect everything you type, including passwords).  Software developers try to prevent security bugs and fix them when they turn up, but not every software developer distributes fixes promptly.</p>
		<div class="endnote">
		  <p>This is especially a problem on smartphones.  If you have an Android phone and a security bug is found, Google fixes it, but they don't send the fix directly to your phone. Google sends new system releases to the phone manufacturers, who may take some time to install local modifications available only on their phones. Only after that do the phone manufacturers send the modified Android code to carriers, who also may take some time to install carrier-specific modifications.  Security fixes can come more quickly on iOS phones, because Apple can send updates to you directly, no matter which carrier you use. </p></div>
		<p>The general name for programs that try to affect your computer badly is <em>malware</em>. One kind of malware is called a <em>virus</em>.  Computer viruses make copies of themselves (just as biological viruses do) and try to spread themselves over the network to other computers. People use <em>antivirus software</em> to help prevent these attacks.</p>
        <p>Another common attack strategy is called <em>phishing</em>: an attacker sends you an email that appears to be from some official organization (such as your bank) and tricks you into giving information to the attackers (such as your bank password).</p>


        <h3>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack</h3>
        <p>One of the easiest ways to make trouble on the net is called a <em>Denial of Service</em> (DoS) attack. This consists of sending a lot of requests (for instance, requests for a web page or some data) to a server at the same time. This can overload the server's network bandwidth. A DoS attack doesn't destroy data or collect passwords; it just causes a temporary inability to reach the targeted server. So, other users of that server are denied service.</p>
        <p>A variant is the <em>Distributed Denial of Service</em> (DDoS) attack, in which the attacker first uses viruses (or similar self-spreading software) to take control of many (sometimes tens of thousands of) computers around the world and then launches a DoS attack from all of them at the same time. Besides increasing the number of simultaneous server requests, DDoS makes it harder to determine who is at fault, since the attack seems to come from many innocent people.</p>
