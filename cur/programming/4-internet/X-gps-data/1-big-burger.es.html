    	<h2>GPS Coordinates</h2>
        <p>Big Burgers is coming to New York City. To  figure out where to put their first new restaurant, the restaurant chain put up signs asking people to use their phones at home to send their location. These locations were recorded using GPS coordinates.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">

                <li> Load your U4L2-GPSData project from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-web-data/3a-scraping.es.html">Lab 1</a>, reading the GPS coordinates into a list of two-item lists.</li>
				<li> How many people reported their location?</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="takeNote"> Each line of data gives a <strong>latitude</strong> and <strong>longitude</strong>, a pair of <strong>GPS coordinates</strong>.
