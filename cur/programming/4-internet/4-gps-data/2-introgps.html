                <li>GH Feedback 8/12: Too much math for high school freshman. Was fun for us to do tho.</li>
                <li>Consider: <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-nesting-lists/3-data-types.html#point">Point Block in Unit 3 Lab 1: Introduction to Lists</a></li>
                <li>First sentence on  page: &quot;Let's take a closer look at the first GPS coordinates in <em><strong>the file</strong></em>.&quot; What file? Is this confusion because 1-big-burger is no longer in the topic file? Why missing? If missing, what should replace it?</li>
            </ul>
    </div>
        
        <p>Let's take a closer look at the first GPS coordinates in the file. The coordinates are <i>40.8,-73.94</i>. GPS coordinates describe a location on Earth by a <strong>latitude</strong> (north-south) and a <strong>longitude</strong> (east-west).	
   	<div class="sidenoteBig">It's not necessary, but if you are interested, read this or another quick introduction on GPS coordinates: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2209240_read-gps-coordinates.html">E-How Tutorial on GPS coordinates</a>. And/or, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQdIjwoi-u4" target="_blank">video on GPS &amp; Relativity</a>.  
            	<div class="todo">I  like the video, and I know that theoretical physics departments are now populated nearly solely by  white male nerdlings. But the message, given this way, helps perpetuate that. It pretty much says "no &lt;fill in  blank&gt; need apply." :-(  PG</div>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>GPS coordinates <i>40.8, -73.94</i> give a location in New York City. Is the latitude 40.8 north or south? North or south of what?</li>
                <li>The longitude -73.94 indicates New York City is <em>west</em> of longitude 0. How might the longitude of Chicago compare to this number? </li>		
            </ol>
		</div>

        <p>In each coordinate pair, the first number is the <em>latitude</em> (north-south), and the second number is the <em>longitude</em> (east-west).</p>

        <div class="todo">Include a 2D map of that locaton with lat and long clearly marked to make it clear WHY we reverse the order. --MF (PG: I give up. Why? The reversal is said in white above, and again in orange below. And then we get angry bold telling us to plot them reversing the order. Sounds totally arbitrary and dangerously important. Why does the $$ stuff not appear in the orange box below?)</div>

        <div class="takeNote"> Note when <em>writing</em> GPS coordinates, the convention is that the first number is <em>latitude</em>, the north-south measurement, and the second, <em>longitude</em>, is measures east-west. <span class="katex-block">latitude, longitude$$ $$40.8,-73.94$$ However, when <em>plotting</em> GPS coordinates, you want the <em>longitude</em> plotted on the horizontal <em>x</em>-axis, and the <em>latitude</em> on the  vertical <em>y</em>-axis is second. $$(longitude, latitude)$$  $$(-73.94, 40.8) </span> <strong>When plotting GPS coordinates, plot them as (longitude, latitude), reversing the written order.</strong></div>

    
        <h3>Making the data useful</h3>
        <div class="comment">*need to build this, think about whether to switch lat and long now, think about whether the data-read-in is relevant* PG: This is clearly still in process, so review is not yet relevant. Notes for later: &quot;the coordinates&quot; sounds like it refers back to something, but I don't see what; &quot;When you open the project&quot; will need a project.</div>
        <p>
            GPS data isn't very useful as a list of numbers; the data is far more useful if we can <em>visualize</em> it. Here are the coordinates as a list of lists: <br />
            <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3Lab5GPS.xml"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/gps_coords.png" alt="set (coordinates) to {{37.869050, -122.272050}, etc}" title="set (coordinates) to {{37.869050, -122.272050}, etc}" /></a><br />
            When you open the project, you will see that the background of the stage is set to an <em>x</em>-<em>y</em> grid and that the sprite's costume is a black circle.

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Write a script to plot the coordinates on the graph. Use <code>stamp</code> to plot the points.<br />
                    When you run your script, you should see this (need to fix this):
                    <div class="sidenote">Remember, plot the longitude first, then the latitude.</div>
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/gps_badpic.png" alt="graph with only one point around (37, -122)" title="graph with only one point around (37, -122)" />
                </li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Why can't you see all the points?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Transform the data</h3>
        <div class="sidenoteBig">You can do it your own way instead if you like.</div>    
        <p>To display all the points, you'll need to <em>transform</em> them. These problems will lead you through one way to do this.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="2">
                <div class="sidenote">Subtracting -74 is the same as adding 74.</div>
                <li>Every point's longitude is around -74 and every point's latitude is around 40. This does not help us tell the points apart. Subtract -74 from every <em>x</em>-coordinate and subtract 40 from every <em>y</em>-coordinate, <strong>using a <a href="">higher-order function</a></strong>.</li>
                <li>Now the first <em>x</em>-coordinate is BLAH. There are many choices we could make to turn this into a "nicer" number. One choice is to multiply every <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-coordinate by BLAH. Adjust your higher-order function to do this calculation as well.</li>
                
                <div class="sidenoteBig">Making Snap<em>!</em> do the work is better, because then the program can be used on <em>any</em> set of GPS points in this area, and not just these. That's abstraction.</div>
                <div class="sidenoteBig">Recall that you made a block called <code>average</code> in <a href="http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-list-operations/combine.html">Lab 2 ("Combine with")</a>.</div>
                <li>Now the first <em>x</em>-coordinate is BLAH, which we still can't see on the grid. Let's center the coordinates around the <em>average</em> <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-coordinate. Subtract the average of all the <em>x</em> values from each of the <em>x</em>-coordinates, and subtract the average of all the&nbsp;<em>y</em> values from each of the <em>y</em>-coordinates. Make Snap<em>!</em> do the work.</li>
                <li>Once you have these transformed coordinates, use your script from problem 1 to plot the points.</li>
