        	Here are the EKs I expect will be covered on this page. Please mark with <em>italics</em> those that have definitely been covered and mark with <strong>bold</strong> those that will definitely not be covered here. Thanks, Mary
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EK6.2.2H</strong> Standards for sharing information and communicating between browsers and servers on the Web include HTTP and secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS).</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.3.1A</strong> The trust model of the Internet involves trade-offs.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.3.1B</strong> The DNS was not designed to be completely secure.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.3.1C</strong> Implementing cybersecurity has software, hardware, and human components.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.3.1D</strong> Cyber warfare and cyber crime have widespread and potentially devastating effects.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.3.1E</strong> Distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) compromise a target by flooding it with requests from multiple systems.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.3.1F</strong> Phishing, viruses, and other attacks have human and software components.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.3.1G</strong> Antivirus software and firewalls can help prevent unauthorized access to private data.</li>

                <li><strong>EK6.3.1K</strong> Symmetric encryption is a method of encryption involving one key for encryption and decryption.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.3.1L</strong> Public key encryption, which is not symmetric, is an encryption method that is widely used because of the functionality it provides.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.3.1M</strong> Certificate authorities (CAs) issue digital certificates that validate the ownership of encrypted keys used in secured communications and are based on a trust model.</li>
