                <li>Open the search engine you usually use, the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank" title="duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> search engine, and another search engine such as <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank" title="google.com">Google</a>, <a href="http://yahoo.com" target="_blank" title="yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>, or <a href="http://bing.com" target="_blank" title="bing.com">Bing</a>. Search for a phrase, like "Internet search engines" or "New York restaurants." Do you get the same search results at each site? Try a search related to politics, such as "Barack Obama."</li>
                <li>Read <a href="http://dontbubble.us" target="_blank" title="dontbubble.us">dontbubble.us</a>.</li>
                <li>Discuss with a partner, then share with the class. How do you think a search engine works? What algorithm might the search engine use to decide what to show you?</li>
                <li>In <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter4.pdf" target="_blank" title="Blown to Bits"><em>Blown to Bits</em></a>, the authors claim that "search is a new form of control over information" (p. 111) and "search is power" (p. 145). Why might it be important to think of the social implications behind searching on the Internet?</li>
