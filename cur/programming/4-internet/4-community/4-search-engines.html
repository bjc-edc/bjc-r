            <p>pink box new (somewhat stolen from the H3). look at other todo box too. --MF, 12/21/17</p>
            <p>BH: Flush the video.  And promote the TIF to FYTD.  Maybe some of the existing FYTD should be ITIT.</p>
            <p>MF: could use review/light revision; tough to have 2.17 SI labs back to back</p>

            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn about search engines and consider whether it matters which tools you use to search the web.</p>

                <li>Open the search engine you usually use, the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank" title="duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> search engine, and another search engine such as <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank" title="google.com">Google</a>, <a href="http://yahoo.com" target="_blank" title="yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>, or <a href="http://bing.com" target="_blank" title="bing.com">Bing</a>. Search for a phrase, like "Internet search engines" or "New York restaurants." Do you get the same search results at each site? Try a search related to politics, such as "Barack Obama."</li>
<!--                <li>Read <a href="http://dontbubble.us" target="_blank" title="dontbubble.us">dontbubble.us</a>.</li> (stale link, alas) -->
                <li>Discuss with a partner, then share with the class. How do you think a search engine works? What algorithm might the search engine use to decide what to show you?</li>
                <li>Search results are different in different countries, even from the same search engine. Investigate the reasons for this. (To start, do a web search for &quot;search censorship.&quot;)</li>
                <li>In <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter4.pdf" target="_blank" title="Blown to Bits"><em>Blown to Bits</em></a>, the authors claim that "search is a new form of control over information" (p. 111) and "search is power" (p. 145). Why might it be important to think of the social implications behind searching on the Internet?</li>

                <li>Google keeps track of searches.

What are benefits and costs to society in general from this tracking? What are benefits and costs to individual users from this tracking?</li>
