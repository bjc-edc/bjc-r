                <li>CRD-1.A.5: Consultation and communication with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations.</li>
                <li>CRD-1.A.6: Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives and to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives.</li>
                <li>IOC-1.A.1: People create computing innovations.</li>
                <li>IOC-1.A.5: Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts.</li>
                <li>IOC-1.B: Explain how a computing innovation can have an impact beyond its intended purpose.</li>
                <li>IOC-1.B.5: Computing innovations have often had unintended beneficial effects by leading to advances in other fields.</li>
                <li>IOC-1.B.6: Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer.</li>

                <li>IOC-1.E.2: Science has been affected by using distributed and “citizen science” to solve scientific problems. </li>
                <li>IOC-1.E.3: Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices.</li>
                <li>IOC-1.E.4: Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the Internet.</li>
                <li>IOC-1.E.5: Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing.</li>
                <li>IOC-1.E.6: Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding.</li>
