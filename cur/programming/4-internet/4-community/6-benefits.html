	<p>In this course, when we talk about the social implications of computing, most of the focus is on <em>bad</em> implications.  That's because you mostly know about the good implications: the ability to communicate with friends worldwide, the explosion in creative expression, information at your fingertips, and so on.  It's the bad implications that need attention.  But we shouldn't completely neglect the benefits of computing.</p>

	<h3>Computing Affects Everything</h3>

	<div class="comment">IOC-1.A.2,5</div>
	<p>The 1975 Queen album <em>A Night at the Opera,</em> the one with "Bohemian Rhapsody" on it, had the words "No synthesizers!" featured in the liner notes.  Music synthesizers, electronic musical instruments that could simulate many other instruments, were just becoming inexpensive enough to be accessible to popular musicians, but were considered cheating, because you could get the sound of a dozen different kinds of instrument without actually being able to play them all.  The Queen album did involve a wide range of instruments, and the group thought they had to defend themselves against an accusation of having cheated.</p>
	<p>Today, of course, digital synthesizers, as well as more specialized computerized instruments such as drum machines, are commonplace in popular music.  The point of the story is that sooner or later, new technology changes people's expectations and becomes accepted.</p>
	<p>

	<h3>Intended and Unintended Implications</h3>

	<p>People make computing innovations, and they do it for some purpose.  But they don't always anticipate all the consequences.  Here's an oversimplified chart of some implications of Facebook.  (Some of what makes it oversimplified will appear later on this page.)</p>

	<div class="comment">IOC-1.A.1,3; IOC-1.B.5,6</div>
	<table rules="all" frame="border" width="90%">
	    <tr>
		<th>&nbsp;</th>
		<th>Intended</th>
		<th>Unintended</th>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<th>Good</th>
		<td> finding old friends</td>
		<td> organizing protests</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<th>Bad</th>
		<td> privacy violation for targeted advertising</td>
		<td> "fake news" to influence elections</td>
	    </tr>
	</table>

	<p>Facebook started as a way for college students to find their friends (their in-person friends, initially) when they go away, for example to a different college.  It turned out to be good for organizing instant group activities, such as political protests, but also volunteers providing emergency services after a disaster.<p>

	<p>Their ability to make money could have been based on charging a fee for a Facebook account, but instead they chose to make the accounts free, and to make money by using records of each user's activities to provide advertising targeted to that user's interests.  The advertising itself isn't necessarily so bad, but the collection of personal data that users don't realize they're giving Facebook (for example, by clicking a "Like" button on another site with no obvious connection to Facebook) is problematic.  But this information gathering was intentionally designed into Facebook.  What Facebook <em>didn't</em> intend was the ability of political campaigns and foreign countries to post content lying about opposing candidates that spreads rapidly throughout the network.<p>

	<div class="comment">IOC-1.A.4</div>
	<p>One way in which the table above is oversimplified is that the categories "good" and "bad" are value judgments.  Otherwise, there wouldn't be any intended bad consequences; why would anyone want that?  Violating people's privacy isn't bad for Mark Zuckerberg; on the contrary, it made him one of the richest people on Earth.  Whenever you see the word "we" used in an argument, make sure you know who's included in "we" and who isn't.  If it's supposed to mean everyone in a society, or everyone in the world, the argument is probably dishonest.</p>
