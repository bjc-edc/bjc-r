	<p>In this course, when we talk about the social implications of computing, most of the focus is on <em>bad</em> implications.  That's because you mostly know about the good implications: the ability to communicate with friends worldwide, the explosion in creative expression, information at your fingertips, and so on.  The bad implications are the ones that need attention.  But we shouldn't completely neglect the benefits of computing.</p>

	<h3>Computing Affects Everything</h3>

	<div class="comment">CRD-2.A.1</div>
	<p>The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression.</p>
	<div class="comment">IOC-1.A.2, IOC-1.A.5 (arts)</div>
	<p>The 1975 Queen album <em>A Night at the Opera,</em> the one with "Bohemian Rhapsody" on it, had the words "No synthesizers!" featured in the liner notes.  Music synthesizers, electronic musical instruments that could simulate many other instruments, were just becoming inexpensive enough to be accessible to popular musicians, but were considered cheating, because you could get the sound of a dozen different kinds of instrument without actually being able to play them all.  The Queen album did involve a wide range of instruments, and the group thought they had to defend themselves against an accusation of having cheated.</p>
	<p>Today, of course, digital synthesizers, as well as more specialized computerized instruments such as drum machines, are commonplace in popular music.  Nobody thinks they're cheating.  The point of the story is that sooner or later, new technology changes people's expectations and becomes accepted.  The innovation expands the reach of <em>human</em> creativity.</p>
	<p>As we write this in 2019, computer-generated graphics are now good enough to allow simulations of dead actors in a movie.  This new technology will make new kinds of storytelling possible, but it also raises both aesthetic and ethical concerns.</p>

	<li>The 2018 congressional election saw the introduction of one candidate making a digitally simulated film of a rival candidate to use as what's called "fake news."  There's no question that that's unethical, but what can we do to prevent it?</li>

	<h3>Computing in Mathematics, Science, and Engineering</h3>

	<div class="comment">IOC-1.A.5 (stem)</div>
	<p>Every branch of science has been transformed by modern computers.  In biology, the central example is <em>DNA sequencing.</em>  DNA is a very long molecule, the fundamental "blueprint" for all living organisms, encoding the patterns that make a hamster a hamster and you you.  The human DNA molecule has over three billion tiny building blocks strung together.  Each person's DNA is unique.  There are only four <em>kinds</em> of building blocks, but imagine trying to answer the question "Does the sequence AAABAC occur anywhere in a string of three billion letters A-D?"  Modern supercomputers and parallelism make it possible for human researchers to answer such questions.</p>

	<div class="comment">IOC-1.E.2. IOC-1.E.3</div>
	<img class="imageRight" alt="protein before and after folding" title="protein before and after folding" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/protein-folding.png" caption="Wikipedia, public domain" />
	<p>Another important topic in biochemistry is <em>protein folding.</em>  When your body needs to produce a protein molecule, the information about what elements to string together is found in your DNA.  But the protein can't do its job in the form of a long string; it has to reshape itself in a particular way.  Certain diseases are the result of proteins folding incorrectly.  Researchers want to find the correct folding (the correct shape) for every protein, but trying every possibility requires enormous amounts of computer time.  This isn't practical unless many computers can be used at once.  Think about your computer or smartphone, if you have one.  Most of the time, it's doing nothing useful.  Your phone spends a lot of its time in your pocket, for example, or plugged into its charger while you're asleep.  The <em>Folding@home</em> group at Stanford University asks people to download a program that will run on your computer or phone only when you're not doing something else with it.  More than 100,000 people have installed the Folding@home software on their computers.  Working together, these computers are like a very large supercomputer, except that supercomputers are expensive, while putting your computer's idle time to work doesn't cost anything.</p>
	<p>Folding@home is just one of several "citizen science" projects.  The first one was the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, which uses volunteered computer time to search for large prime numbers.  (Mathematicians are interested in how primes are distributed, such as two consecutive odd integers both being prime.  Large primes are also of practical importance in public key cryptography, which you met earlier in this unit.)</p>
	<div class="comment">IOC-1.E.4</div>
	<div class="vocab"> <b>Crowdsourcing</b> is the general term for getting a lot of people to help solve a computing problem.</div>
	<p>Another early citizen science project, probably the most famous, is SETI@home, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, created by astronomers at the University of California, Berkeley.  This project uses donated computer time to study the pictures produced by large telescopes, looking for radio signals that seem patterned and so probably artificial, produced by intelligent life on a faraway planet.  SETI@home hasn't found any intelligent aliens so far, although it has found candidate radio signals for further study.</p>
	<p>All of these projects require nothing from their volunteers other than installing a program.  But after some Folding@home users declared that they could find protein folds faster than a computer could do it, biochemists at the University of Washington collaborated with computer scientists in the UW Center for Game Science to create a video game, Foldit, in which you get points for folding proteins correctly.  People carry out computations much more slowly than computers, but people can look at a picture, such as a picture of a protein, and take in the whole shape at once, instantly seeing possible folds.  Computers, so far, can't do that instant analysis of a picture as a whole.</p>
	<p>They didn't have to make Foldit a game; they could have just presented it as an opportunity to help science.  But turning it into a game sparks people's competitive spirit (some people's; other people aren't interested in competitive games) and gets people to try harder and for a longer period of time than they might without the "gamification" of the task.</p>


	<h3>Intended and Unintended Implications</h3>

	<p>People make computing innovations, and they do it for some purpose.  But they don't always anticipate all the consequences.  Here's an oversimplified chart of some implications of Facebook.  (Some of what makes it oversimplified will appear later on this page.)</p>

	<div class="comment">IOC-1.A.1,3; IOC-1.B.5,6</div>
	<table rules="all" frame="border" width="90%">
	<col width="25%">
	<col width="35%">
	<col width="30%">
	    <tr>
		<th><b>Facebook consequences</b></th>
		<th>Intended</th>
		<th>Unintended</th>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<th>Good</th>
		<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;finding old friends</td>
		<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;organizing protests</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		<th>Bad</th>
		<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;privacy violation for targeted advertising</td>
		<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;"fake news" to influence elections</td>
	    </tr>
	</table>

	<p>Facebook started as a way for college students to find their friends (their in-person friends, initially) when they go away, for example to a different college.  It turned out to be good for organizing instant group activities, such as political protests, but also volunteers providing emergency services after a disaster.<p>

	<p>Facebook's ability to make money could have been based on charging a fee for a Facebook account, but instead they chose to make the accounts free, and to make money by using records of each user's activities to provide advertising targeted to that user's interests.  The advertising itself isn't necessarily so bad, but the collection of personal data that users don't realize they're giving Facebook (for example, by clicking a "Like" button on another site with no obvious connection to Facebook) is problematic.  But this information gathering was intentionally designed into Facebook.  What Facebook <em>didn't</em> intend was the ability of political campaigns and foreign countries to post content lying about opposing candidates that spreads rapidly throughout the network.<p>

	<div class="comment">IOC-1.A.4</div>
	<p>One way in which the table above is oversimplified is that the categories "good" and "bad" are value judgments.  If everyone agreed about them, there wouldn't be any intended bad consequences.  Violating people's privacy isn't bad for Mark Zuckerberg; on the contrary, it made him one of the richest people on Earth.  Whenever you see the word "we" used in an argument, make sure you know who's included in "we" and who isn't.  If it's supposed to mean everyone in a society, or everyone in the world, the argument is probably dishonest.</p>

	<h3>Collaborative Design</h3>

	<div class="comment">IOC-1.A.1, IOC-1.E.5</div>
	<p>Of course, computing innovations are created by people, not by computers.  The worldwide nature of the Internet both <em>requires</em> and <em>enables</em> collaborative design.  Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing.</p>
	<p>The old stereotype of software development is one guy (always male, in the stereotype) in the basement, who has an idea and goes without sleep until the software is finished.  Like all stereotypes, this was never <em>quite</em> true, but it had some truth to it.  That style of development worked because when computers were expensive, the people who used them were mostly programmers, with expertise and values a lot like those of the guy in the basement.  So software that he liked to use would be popular with the other programmers, too.</p>
	<div class="comment">CRD-1.A.3, CRD-1.A.5, CRD-1.A.6</div>
	<p>No part of that picture holds true today.  Computers are so small and so inexpensive that nearly everyone has one, kept in their pocket.  It's also their camera and their telephone.  So, for a software project to be successful today,
	<ul>
	    <li>it must meet the needs of people at all levels of expertise;</li>
	    <li>it must meet the cultural expectations of users from every country, of every economic class, every race, every gender, and every other social division;</li>
	    <li>it must meet (or create) a <em>need</em> of all those people.</li>
	</ul>
	Nobody has enough experience with enough cultures to design for all these expectations.  Instead, innovations are designed by a <em>team</em> that includes potential users, from a variety of cultures, ideally by choosing diverse technical experts (programmers, graphic artists, user interface experts, and others) who'll do the actual implementation.  In addition, modern innovators survey large numbers of users outside their team to double-check that everyone's expectations are satisfied.  (This is why you may see invitations from a company to "alpha test" a new program.  It's only partly to help catch out-and-out bugs; it also finds out early if some users are going to get angry about something the developers never considered.</p>
	<div class="comment">CRD-1.A.4, IOC-1.F.11(2)</div>
	<p>Another reason a variety of people on the design team is desirable is to help avoid <em>bias</em> in the innovation.  In some early testing of self-driving cars, it was found that they weren't good at detecting pedestrians who were people of color.  This wasn't deliberate, of course; the artificial intelligence program that detected pedestrians had been trained on a vast collection of photographs of people, in which all the people happened to be light-skinned.  Luckily this problem was discovered in early testing, before the self-driving cars were really sent out on the road.</p>

	<div class="comment">CRD-1.B.1 (next four paragraphs)</div>
	<p>How do computers and the Internet enable collaboration?  The way that's most taken for granted is the worldwide telephone system.  Telephones are older than computers, but the early telephone systems didn't have area codes, let alone country codes.  You could dial people in your town, but to call anyone else you had to ask an operator (a telephone company worker) to connect you by hand.  Today, connecting telephone calls is done by computer, and you can dial just about any telephone on Earth yourself.</p>
	<p>Computers are more visibly involved when you use virtual meeting software.  Skype, the best-known example, is free in the sense of not costing you money to use it (although not in the sense of giving you the right to see or modify the software).  But Skype's free service degrades significantly if more than two or three people are on the call.  Both Skype and other companies offer commercial virtual meeting software that can connect dozens of users with good quality.</p>
	<p>Besides talking with each other, developers can collaborate on <em>multi-author documents</em> using software that allows them to share the ownership of an online document.  The best-known such system is Google Docs; like Skype, it's free in the money sense but not in the sense of sharing the software that implements it.</p>
	<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/git.png" width="165">
	<!-- waiting to see if I get away with this before typing in alt text -->
	<p>Systems that allow several people to edit the same document at the same time have the problem that one person's edits may contradict another person's.  <em>Revision control systems,</em> of which the best-known is Git (free in both senses), support a more complicated but safer kind of collaboration:  Each person has a private copy of the shared document, and edits that copy.  When a collaborator is ready to share an edit with the rest of the team, the software <em>synchronizes</em> the local changes with the online, shared version.  If changes from two collaborators conflict, the software won't allow the synchronization until the conflicting text is resolved.  The software also remembers the complete history of who changed what when, so it's possible to undo a change even if other parts of the document have changed since then.  But succeeding with Git does require a certain level of expertise.</p>
