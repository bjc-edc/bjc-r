        <h2>Domain Name System (DNS) Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>Before the Internet, there were smaller networks of computers (for example, about 200 on the Arpanet at its peak), and every computer on a network knew the name of all the other computers on that network. This worked pretty well back when a computer cost roughly <em>a million dollars</em> and so there weren't very many of them. But that's not a strategy that can be scaled up for over 3 billion computers!</p>
        <div class="sidenoteBig">A <em>hierarchy</em> is an arrangement in which things are ranked one above the other according to status or inclusion. For example in biology, we use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank" target="_blank">taxonomic hierarchy</a>: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species.</div>
        <p>That's why Internet host names are <em>hierarchical</em>. If you want to know where <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">snap.berkeley.edu</a> is, your computer only has to know where to find an <em>edu</em> name server. And that  server only has to know where to find a <a href="http://berkeley.edu" target="_blank">berkeley.edu</a> name server. That server at UC Berkeley directs your computer to <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">snap.berkeley.edu</a>.</p>
		<div class="comment">In the future, I would like to do this for a URL that is more meaningful to the students in this class (e.g. snap.berkeley.org or bjc.edc.org). --MF</div>
        <p>
        	Here's a model of the hierarchy for york.cs.berkeley.edu:<br />

        <div class="ifTime">
            <div class="endnote">
                <p>There are two kinds of top-level name domains: <strong>country codes</strong> and <strong>categories</strong>.  <a href="http://goes.gsfc.nasa.gov/text/web_country_codes.html" target="_blank">Every country</a> has an official two-letter country code (such as.us for the United States, .uk for the United Kingdom, or .th for Thailand).</p>
                <p>
                Originally, there were six category domains: 
                <ul>
                    <li><em>.gov</em> for government,</li>
                    <li><em>.edu</em> for educational institutions, </li>
                    <li><em>.com</em> for commercial businesses, </li>
                    <li><em>.mil</em> for (US) military sites, </li>
                    <li><em>.org</em> for general organizations, and</li> 
                    <li><em>.net</em> for network-related sites. </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More recently, new top-level category domains have been created, e.g., <em>.biz</em> for businesses, as an alternative to <em>.com</em>. These new categories are intended to relieve crowding in the original domains. For example, let's say you start a company called Garply Web Services. You can't have <a href="http://garply.com" target="_blank">garply.com</a>, which is taken by an online telephone directory service. But (as of October 2015) <a href="http://garply.biz" target="_blank">garply.biz</a> is available.</p>
                <p>There is still competition even with these new category domains. As soon as they were introduced, people bought huge numbers of common words in order to resell them at higher prices. For example, Mr. Robert Skelton of Cheswick, Australia offers the domain name <a href="http://snap.biz" target="_blank">snap.biz</a> for $7500. By contrast, you can buy <a href="http://garply.biz" target="_blank">garply.biz</a> for $7.99 if you hurry!</p>
