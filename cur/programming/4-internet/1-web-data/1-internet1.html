                    Dan Feedback 1/17/16: You have the following as "integrate as needed next year":
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bandwidth: a measure of bit rateâ€”the amount of data (measured in bits b) that can be sent in a fixed time. Usually b/s</li>
                        <li>Latency: the time elapsed between the transmission and the receipt of a request. Usually ms.</li>
                    </ul>
                    BUT bandwidth and latency are part of the CF so they need to occur somewhere this year...

        <p>The Internet is pretty much everywhere humans are. Even astronauts use the Internet on the International Space Station.

            Here is a 2012 map of global Internet usage as a percentage of population from Wikipedia:<br />

		<p>People talk as if "the Internet" and "the World Wide Web" are the same thing, but they are not. The World Wide Web is the collection of interlinked website documents you can view with a web browser by typing URLs such as <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html</a>.</p>


        <p>But the Internet is more general than the World Wide Web. It also supports email (which can sometimes be seen through a web browser but is transmitted with a different protocol), file transfer, mobile apps, and many other ways computers communicate behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>The Internet is a massive network of computers that communicate primarily using a pair of protocols (standards):
            <ul>
                <li>IP: routing (finding paths to distant computers) and </li>
                <li>TCP: assuring reliable transmission of data.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
