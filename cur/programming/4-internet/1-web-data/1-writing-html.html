        	Here are the EKs I expect will be covered on this page. Please mark with <em>italics</em> those that have definitely been covered and mark with <strong>bold</strong> those that will definitely not be covered here. Thanks, Mary

                        <li>Experiment with removing some of the CSS syntax (like the brackets, the colon, or the semicolon).</li>

    				Syntax is like grammar for a programming language. It defines what words and symbols can go where. Snap<em>!</em> is block-based lanague, so you won't deal with syntax for most of this course.
