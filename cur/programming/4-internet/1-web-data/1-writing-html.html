        <h2>Writing for the Web with HTML</h2>
        <div class="todo">This page is ready for review (BH has reviewed). Please note that I made this the most mellow of intros to HTML&mdash;basically just enough so that the <code>http</code> block report isn't totally incomprehensible. I used Paul's suggestion to "use an online two-view tool" (I chose w3school's because I find that site easy to use.) See what you think. --MF</div>
        <div class="todo" style="display:none;">
            <p>By Mary's assessment, this code.org video covers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EK4.1.2E</strong> Some programming languages are designed for specific domains and are better for expressing algorithms in those domains.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.1.1A</strong> The Internet connects devices and networks all over the world.</li>
				<li><strong>EK6.2.2H</strong> Standards for sharing information and communicating between browsers and servers on the Web include HTTP and secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS).</li>
				<li><strong>EK6.3.1M</strong> Certificate authorities (CAs) issue digital certificates that validate the ownership of encrypted keys used in secured communications and are based on a trust model.</li>

            </ul>
        </div>

		<p>Most web pages are written with HTML (hypertext markup language) and read with HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol). </p>

                	<ol>
                    	<li>Create a second heading and more paragraphs.</li>
                        <li>Try deleting some or part of the html tags like "&lt;title&gt;" or "&lt;/h1&gt;".</li>

                	Try out the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_default" target="_blank">CSS example</a>. Make some changes to the code:
					<div class="todo">Hex isn't in our curriculum yet, but it should be (EK 2.1.1D and EK 2.1.1F). I think we should add it to U1L5 near binary when we clean up that Lab, which needs attention for coherence to itself. Then it can come up again in U4 both here with this brief intro to HTML/CSS and then again with IPv4. For now, I'm just putting in a simple, fun link for anyone who wonders what hex is. --MF</div>
                    <ol>
						<li>Notice the two different ways color is coded (as a <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/hexadecimal-decimal-colors.html" target="_blank">hexadecimal</a> number: "d0e4fe" and as a word: "orange"). Experiment with style  of the body, level 1 heading, and paragraph.</li>
                        <li>Experiment with removing some of the CSS syntax (like the brackets, the colon, or the semicolon).</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
                <div class="takeNote">
    				Syntax is like grammar for a programming language. It defines what words and symbols can go where. Snap<em>!</em> is block-based lanague, so you won't deal with syntax for most of this course.

				<li>Add to your written assignment a description of what CSS can be used to do.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You can "View Source" for any web page using your browser. You might be able to find it in a menu, or <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000746.htm" target="_blank">look up how to do it in your browser</a>.</p>
            <ol start="7">
                <li>Look at the source code for a few different web pages and make a list of all the HTML formatting commands you can figure out. For example, what code makes text appear in <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italics</em>?</li>
