		<p>People talk as if "the Internet" and "the World Wide Web" were the same thing, but they are not. The World Wide Web is the collection of interlinked website documents you can view with a web browser by typing URLs such as <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html</a>.</p>
        <div class="takeNote">
            <h4>What is a URL?</h4>
            <div class="comment">This is not in the standards, but I thought it was important enough and basic enough to be worth addressing. --MF</div>
            A URL or Uniform Resource Locator is like an address for accessing specific web data. URLs can be broken into three parts:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/URL-structure.jpg" alt="parts of a URL" title="parts of a URL" />
            <ol>
                <li>The protocol (usually "http" or "https") that your computer uses to access the site, followed by a colon (:). (More about protocols soon.)</li>
                <li>The domain name (or host), which is everything after // and before another slash. This is the name of the computer that hosts the page.</li>
            	<div class="endnote">For example, the URL <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html</a> tells your computer to use http to access the bjc.berkeley.edu server (the computer that serves web pages for that site).</div>
                <li>Everything after the domain name. Different hosts interpret the rest of the URL in different ways, but usually additional slashes describe a path in a hierarchy of folders.  Other punctuation, such as ?, =, and &amp; are used to provide the server with parts of a request other than the path to a page.</li>
            	<div class="endnote">The URL <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html</a> tells your computer to go to the "website" folder on the bjc.berkeley.edu server, and open the "privacy.html" file.</div>

        <p>But the Internet is more general than the World Wide Web. It also supports email (which can sometimes be seen through a web browser but is transmitted with a different protocol), file transfer, mobile apps, and many other ways computers communicate behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>The Internet is a massive network of computers that communicate primarily using a pair of protocols (standards):

        <h3>A Brief History of the Internet</h3>        
        <p>The beginnings of the Internet were designed in the 1960s with the connection of the first 4 computers of what was then called the Arpanet. Since then, the number of people connected to the internet has been increasing exponentially. These days, several different systems of communication run on the Internet:
            <ul>
                <li>Email was invented in the early 1960s.</li>
                <li>The World Wide Web wasn't invented until over 20 years later, in 1989.</li>
                <li>Search engines for the Web were created in 1993. Before that, there was a complete list of all servers, which would not be realistic today!</li>
                <li>The term &quot;Web 2.0&quot; was coined in 1999 to describe a gradual shift in the use of the Web technology from a style in which almost all content was generated by large corporations to one in which individual users could post content (blogs, photos, etc.), leading to a revival of the social networking that had been common on the Internet prior to the development of the Web.</li>
            </ul>

		<h3>Network Redundancy</h3>
        <p>With such an enormous amount of data traveling around, the Internet needs to be reliable, and we have achieved this by making the Internet <em>redundant</em>. Wherever information is going, there is more than one way to get there. This increases the Internet's fault tolerance (ability to work around problems) and helps the Internet scale (expand) to more devices and people.</p>
	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/redundancy.gif" alt="redundancy in action" title="redundancy in action" />

	<!-- Question 1 -->

                In this model of a network, what is the fewest number of nodes (connection points) that can stop working before the sender and the receiver can’t communicate?
            </div>
            <div class="choice" identifier="c1">
                <div class="text">1</div>
                <div class="feedback">
                    There are no nodes that are vital to the system. Pick any node to stop working, and you can still find another path. 
                </div>

                    Correct! If the node with 6 connections goes down and also either of the two to its left, the sender and receiver can’t communicate.

        <h3>Domain Name Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>Before the Internet, there were smaller networks of computers (for example, about 100 on the Arpanet at its peak), and every computer on a network knew the name of all the other computers on that network. This worked pretty well back when a computer cost roughly a million dollars and so there weren't very many of them. But that's not a strategy that can be scaled up for over 3 billion computers.</p>
        <p>That's why Internet host names are <em>hierarchical</em>. If you want to know where <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">snap.berkeley.edu</a> is, your computer only has to know where to find an <em>edu</em> name server. And that  server only has to know where to find a <a href="http://berkeley.edu" target="_blank">berkeley.edu</a> name server. That server at UC Berkeley directs your computer to <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">snap.berkeley.edu</a>.</p>
		<p>
        	Here's a model of the heirarchy for york.cs.berkeley.edu:<br />
        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/hierarchical-2.jpg" alt="Domain Name Hierarchy" title="Domain Name Hierarchy" />
        </p>

        <div class="ifTime" id="first">
            <div class="endnote">
                <p>There are two kinds of top-level name domains: country codes and categories.  Every country has an official two-letter country code (like .us for the United States, .uk for the United Kingdom, or .th for Thailand).</p>
                <p>
                Originally, there were six category domains: 
                <ul>
                    <li><em>.gov</em> for government,</li>
                    <li><em>.edu</em> for educational institutions, </li>
                    <li><em>.com</em> for commercial businesses, </li>
                    <li><em>.mil</em> for (US) military sites, </li>
                    <li><em>.org</em> for general organizations, and</li> 
                    <li><em>.net</em> for network-related sites. </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>More recently, new top-level category domains have been created, e.g., <em>biz</em> for businesses, as an alternative to <em>com</em>. These new categories are intended to relieve crowding in the original domains.</p>
                <p>For example, let's say you start a company called Garply Web Services. You can't have <a href="http://garply.com" target="_blank">garply.com</a>, which is taken by an online telephone directory service. But (as of October 2015) <a href="http://garply.biz" target="_blank">garply.biz</a> is available.</p>
                <p>There has been some competition even for these new category domains. As soon as they were introduced, people bought huge numbers of common words in order to resell them at higher prices. For example, Mr. Robert Skelton of Cheswick, Australia offers the domain name <a href="http://snap.biz" target="_blank">snap.biz</a> for $7500. By contrast, you can buy <a href="http://garply.biz" target="_blank">garply.biz</a> for $7.99 if you hurry!</p>
