              <li>Can we use a page with cleaner HTML than snap.berkeley.edu? Also, what if whatever page we use changes even a little and things no longer match up? Should we use a dummy page of our own designed for this lab? --MF
                  <ul>
                      <li>PG: yes, we should use our own page, and a <em>simple</em> one. The http block's report is ephemeral,  switching back and forth requires re-clicking the block, rechecking to see what the page says, and generally makes it almost impossible to see <em>anything</em> recognizable. As for looking at the text browser tab, can we assume everyone knows what they're looking for. &quot;Above the page&quot; is only a dim cue and we see only part of the text in that tab anyway.</li>
                      <li>PG: first problem is that kids have no idea what they <em>should</em> be expecting to find in a web page, or even that a web page uses a programming language to organize the elements (pictures and text) on the page and create the buttons that we click, <em>just as they've created buttons to click in Snap</em>.</li>
                      <li>PG: what I <em>really</em> think should happen is that students use an online two-view tool, code and image, and build a simple web page, perhaps for their school or interest or... With text and a graphic and (perhaps) a button or some other whizzy feature, and <em>then</em> look at some page we build (or some other) to see if they can find such features.  Or something. A low level part of the purpose of this page is to show what's under the hood of a web page (for which they don't need Snap), to show that they can see the source of a page (for which they don't need Snap), and to show that they can <em>get</em> that source with Snap so that they can process it for some purpose (like weather app, etc.).<ul><li>How's this one? <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_basic" target="_blank">W3 Schools TryIt Editor</a> --MF</li></ul></li>

                	This feels like a trick question, so I cut it. You sit and look through all this code that you don't understand, but there isn't actually anything there to find. --MF<br />

                <li>It may not look like there is anything in the speech balloon that corresponds to the actual page, but look at the text in the browser tab <em>above</em> the page.  What does it say? Can you find that text in what the <code>http</code> block reported?</li>

        <p>
            The output of the <code>http</code> block is the code that creates the page at the address in the input slot. This web page notation, with things of the form:<br />
            <center>&lt;tag&gt;A bunch of text&lt;/tag&gt;</center><br />
            is a <em>special purpose programming language</em> (it's designed for a specific task) called <strong>HTML</strong> (HyperText Markup Language).

        <div class="comment">I know &lt;body&gt; is HTML code, but I think it's confusing to use the same formatting for HTML code as for Snap<em>!</em> code. --MF</div>

        	Every web page has a <em>head</em> (that tells the browser how to format the page) and a <em>body</em> (that contains the actual information on the page). You'll see something more interesting if you skip over the head by looking for the text "&lt;body&gt;":<br />

        <p>You very likely got an empty result back.  This is because of a security feature that disallows one web site (such as the Snap<em>!</em> server) from sending a request to another site.  Fortunately for us, it's not a very bulletproof attempt at security...</p>

                      <p>PG: We <em>must</em> say something, because editing the block <em>doesn't</em> tell us how it works. It shows some magic thing we won't understand.</p>

		<h2>Scraping Data from Web Pages</h2>
        <div class="todo">
        	<p>What is the point of this page (from a students' perspective)? It seems arbitary to me. (I can see that it's introducing data scraping.) I'll try to think of some mini-projecty thing to do here, but please feel free to leave an idea... --MF</p>
            <p>Idea from Bowen: Preview GPS for easy first part (<a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-gps-data/GPS-NYC.csv">GPS-NYC.csv</a> <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-gps-data/1-big-burger.html">Unit 4 Lab 4: GPS Forensics</a>) and Weather app for unlucky hard part below (<a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-weather-app/2-weather-grab.html">Unit 4 Lab 2: Weather App</a>).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="sidenote">Weather forecast sites change their pages from time to time, so we're going to start with a web site we control. We'll build these blocks in a weather app in Lab 2.</div>
        <p>The Internet is full of information that you can use in your programs.  For example, you will write an <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/umbrella.png" alt="umbrella? predicate" title="umbrella? predicate" /> block that looks up the weather forecast for your location and tells you whether or not to carry an umbrella or a block that reports the current temperature for a certain location:<br /><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/current-temp-62.png" alt="current temperature in (New York) reporting 62" title="current temperature in (New York) reporting 62" /></p>
        <p> We want a list of all the available libraries of Snap<em>!</em> blocks.
                
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p><strong>Sometimes you're lucky,</strong> and a URL points directly to a data file:</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
	            <li>If you don't already have it open, load your project "U4L1-Web" from the <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-web-data/2-read-web.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">previous page</a>.</li>

                    The reported value above is a multi-line text string.  Just as you did for <em>words</em> and <em>sentences</em> in Unit 3, in this unit you'll often find it more convenient to have a list with one <em>line</em> per item.  In your scripting area you should see this script:<br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/libraries-txt-list.png" alt="split LIBRARIES by line"><br />
                    <div class="sidenote"><img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/drag-out.gif" width="75%" alt="animation of dragging out resize corner"></div>
                    Click on it, and pull out the bottom right corner of the stage watcher so that you can see the entire list.<br />
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Compare this list with the result in the speech balloon above.  What do you notice?</li>
                        <li>In the Snap<em>!</em> file menu, click on "Libraries..." and look at the submenu that appears.  Compare it with what's in the file.  Why do you think they're different?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Find the <code>split</code> block in the Operators palette, and experiment with the different options for the second input slot. Read the help screen (right-click on a <code>split</code> block and choose &quot;Help&quot;) if you need ideas.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        
        <div class="takeNote"><strong>When you're <em>not</em> lucky,</strong> the information you want is buried in a mass of HTML code.  Extracting the information from the formatting is called <em>scraping</em> the web page.</div>
        
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="3">

                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/libraries-dir-list.png" alt="split libraries by line"><br />
                    You're putting the result in a global variable only because there's a watcher for that variable on the stage, so it's easy to see the result.

                <li>
                    We'd like to extract the list of files from this web page.  As a first step, use a higher order function to select only the list items that contain file names, rather than header text.  You'll find this block helpful:<br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/contains.png" alt="( ) contains ( ) ?">

                    The <code>scrape</code> block in this project is an attempt to scrape just the file names from the <code>libraries</code> web page.  It almost works, but it has a couple of problems.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Read the code of <code>scrape</code> and make sure you understand how it works.  It uses helper blocks<br />
                            <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/substring-starting.png" alt="substring of ( ) starting ( )"><br />
                            <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/substring-upto.png" alt="substring of ( ) up to ( )"><br />
                            Notice the narrow input slot in the second of those; it's meant to let you know that only a single character goes there, not a multi-character string.  Experiment with these blocks.
                        </li>
                        <li>Fix the bugs in <code>scrape</code> so that you get a complete list of files and nothing else.</li>
                        <li>Try your <code>scrape</code> block on <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/Costumes" target="new">snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/Costumes</a> to make sure it can work on <em>any</em> file directory.
