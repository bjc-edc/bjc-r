                    The value reported is a long text string. You'll find it more convenient to have a list with one line per item. Use the <code>split</code> block to create a list, and assign the list to a variable called <var>coordinates</var>.<br />
                    <!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/set-coordinates-to-split-CSV.png" alt="set (coordinates) to {split (http(http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-gps-data/GPS-NYC.csv)) by (line)}" title="set (coordinates) to {split (http(http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-gps-data/GPS-NYC.csv)) by (line)}" />-->
					<div class="takeNote">The <code>split</code> block breaks up a string of text according what you select in the second input slot and puts the  strings into a list as items.</div>

                <li>
                	Convert this list into a list of lists, where each inside list contains each piece of the coordinate pair, like this:<br />
					<div class="sidenoteBig">
                        <p>You will need to use the <code>split</code> block a second time. Experiment with different options for the second input slot. Read the <code>split</code> help screen (right-click a <code>split</code> block and choose "Help") if you need ideas.</p>
                        <p>Think back to Unit 3. How can you perform a function (in this case, <code>split</code>) to each item in the input list?</p>
