            A URL or Uniform Resource Locator is like an address for accessing specific web data. URLs can be broken into three parts:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/URL-structure.jpg" alt="parts of a URL" title="parts of a URL" />
            <ul>
                <li>The <span class="red">protocol</span> (usually "http" or "https") that your computer uses to access the site, followed by a colon (:).</li>
                <li>The <span class="darkgreen">domain name</span> (or host), which is everything after // and before another slash. This is the name of the computer that hosts the page.</li>
            	<div class="endnote">For example, the URL <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html</a> tells your computer to use http to access the bjc.berkeley.edu server (the computer that serves web pages for that site).</div>
                <li>The <span class="blue">path</span>, everything after the domain name. Different hosts interpret the rest of the URL in different ways, but usually additional slashes describe a path in a hierarchy of folders.  Other punctuation, such as ?, =, and &amp; are used to provide the server with parts of a request other than the path to a page.</li>
            	<div class="endnote">The URL <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html</a> tells your computer to go to the "website" folder on the bjc.berkeley.edu server, and open the "privacy.html" file.</div>
