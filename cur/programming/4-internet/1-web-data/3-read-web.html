                <li>U4L1: "Many students in NYC connect to the Web through a proxy server; perhaps there is opportunity to discuss what this is and why in the context of their own experience."</li>
                <li>U4L1: "Students did not seem to understand what crossorigin.me was or the purpose of a proxy server, but again, they are using a modified version of our materials."</li>
                <li>U4L1: "As in the previous class, nearly every student mistakenly expected &lt;substring of ... up to...&gt; to report a string including the input in the second slot (which it does not). There was also confusing about &lt;substring of ... starting with ...&gt; reporting "all the words after [2nd input]" though it begins with the 2nd input."</li>
                <li>U4L1: "Edit to #6 (Try the http block with a different URL.) to make "different" more obvious."</li>

        <p>The Internet is full of information that you can use in your programs.  For example in Lab 4, you will write an <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/umbrella.png" alt="umbrella? predicate" title="umbrella? predicate" /> block that looks up the weather forecast for your location and tells you whether or not to carry an umbrella. You'll also build a <code>current temperature</code> block that reports the current temperature for a certain location:<br /><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/current-temp-34.png" alt="current temperature in (New York) reporting 34" title="current temperature in (New York) reporting 34" /></p>

                	In another browser window, open the page <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">http://snap.berkeley.edu</a> for reference. The page starts with two pictures (the Snap<em>!</em> logo and a screenshot), then some text.<br />
					<img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/s-b-e.png" width="50%" alt="snap.berkeley.edu as seen in browser">
                </li>
                <li>It may not look like there is anything in the speech balloon that corresponds with the actual page, but look at the page title (in the top bar of the browser window or tab). Can you find that text in what the <code>http</code> block reported?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>The output of the <code>http</code> block is the HTML code that creates the page at the address in the input slot.</p>
        
		<p>
        	Every web page has a <em>head</em> (that tells the browser how to format the page) and a <em>body</em> (that contains the actual information on the page). You'll see something more interesting if you skip over the head by looking for the text "&lt;body":<br />
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/s-b-e-body-reporting.png" alt="substring of (http://(snap.berkeley.edu)) starting with (&lt;body) reporting" title="substring of (http://(snap.berkeley.edu)) starting with (&lt;body) reporting"/>

            	<p>
                	There are two custom <code>substring</code> blocks included in this project. They each report only a portion of a text string:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <code>substring starting with</code> block reports the part that <em>starts with</em> the text you enter in the input slot.</li>
                        <li>The <code>substring up to</code> block reports only the part <em>up to</em> the text you enter in the input slot.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if the variable <var>string</var> contains "This is an example of the substring blocks.", then the two substring blocks will report:
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/substring-starting-with-reporting.png" alt="substring of (string) starting with (example) reporting 'example of the substring blocks.'" title="substring of (string) starting with (example) reporting 'example of the substring blocks.'" />&nbsp;

        </div>
        <p>You very likely got an empty result back. This is due to a security feature. One web site (such as the Snap<em>!</em> server) is not allowed to send a request to another site. Fortunately for us, it's not a very solid attempt at security...</p>

                <li>Try the <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/proxied-http.png" alt="proxied http://"> block with your URL. (Hint: this time, it should work. Be sure <em>not</em> to include the "http://" in the input slot.) </li>
                <div class="takeNote">
					<p>The <code>proxied http</code> block works by fooling the other web site into sending you data it wouldn't normally send. Most websites receive a request coming from Snap<em>!</em> and say "this isn't a real web browser query, so I'm not answering." The <code>proxied http</code> block uses a proxy (a replacement or stand-in) server (in this case, <a href="http://alloworigin.com/" target="_blank">alloworigin.com</a>) to call the URL you enter. The proxy server performs the request properly (as a browser would), gets the information, and sends it to Snap<em>!</em> as though things went smoothly.</p>

                	<p>In short, the <code>proxied http</code> block works the way we want the <code>http</code> block to work.</p>
