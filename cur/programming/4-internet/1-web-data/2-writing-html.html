        <h2>Writing for the Web with HTML</h2>
        <div class="todo">This page is <strong>ready for review</strong> (BH has reviewed). Please note that I made this the most mellow of intros to HTML&mdash;basically just enough so that the <code>http</code> block report isn't totally incomprehensible. I used Paul's suggestion to "use an online two-view tool" (I chose w3school's because I find that site easy to use.) See what you think. --MF</div>
        <div class="todo">
        	PG original remarks: 
            <ul>
            	<li>first problem is that kids have no idea what they <em>should</em> be expecting to find in a web page, or even that a web page uses a programming language to organize the elements (pictures and text) on the page and create the buttons that we click, <em>just as they've created buttons to click in Snap</em>.</li>
                <li>what I <em>really</em> think should happen is that students use an online two-view tool, code and image, and build a simple web page, perhaps for their school or interest or... With text and a graphic and (perhaps) a button or some other whizzy feature, and <em>then</em> look at some page we build (or some other) to see if they can find such features.  Or something. A low level part of the purpose of this page is to show what's under the hood of a web page (for which they don't need Snap), to show that they can see the source of a page (for which they don't need Snap), and to show that they can <em>get</em> that source with Snap so that they can process it for some purpose (like weather app, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
			How's this page for addressing these concerns? --MF
        </div>
        <div class="todo" style="display:none;">
            <p>By Mary's assessment, this code.org video covers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EK4.1.2E</strong> Some programming languages are designed for specific domains and are better for expressing algorithms in those domains.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.1.1A</strong> The Internet connects devices and networks all over the world.</li>
				<li><strong>EK6.2.2H</strong> Standards for sharing information and communicating between browsers and servers on the Web include HTTP and secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS).</li>
				<li><strong>EK6.3.1M</strong> Certificate authorities (CAs) issue digital certificates that validate the ownership of encrypted keys used in secured communications and are based on a trust model.</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        
        

		<p>Most web pages are written with HTML (hypertext markup language) and read with HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol). </p>

					<div class="todo">Hex isn't in our curriculum yet, but it should be (EK 2.1.1D and EK 2.1.1F). I think we should add it to U1L5 near binary when we clean up that Lab, which needs attention for coherence to itself. Then it can come up again in U4 both here with this brief intro to HTML/CSS and then again with IPv4. For now, I'm just putting in a simple, fun link for anyone who wonders what hex is. --MF</div>
                    <ol>
                    <div class="todo">There's no such thing as a hexadecimal number!  If we're going to link to an external site it has to be one that's accurate.  (We already went through this discussion long ago about binary and CS Unplugged.) --bh<ul><li>Brian, is your primary concern that the page uses the term "hexadecimal number"? While I agree that it's not correct, it is a very commonly used term (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal" target="_blank">wikipedia.org</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/applying-math-reasoning-topic/alternate-number-bases/v/hexadecimal-number-system" target="_blank">khanacademy.org</a>) and it's going to be hard to find any site that does something nice and accessible that doesn't use the term. We haven't covered HEX yet or HEX colors (though I think we should by this point), so students need something here to explain what that is at least for year 1. If not this, then what do you suggest? --MF</div>
						<li>Notice the two different ways color is coded (as a <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/hexadecimal-decimal-colors.html" target="_blank">hexadecimal</a> numeral, "d0e4fe," and as a word, "orange"). Experiment with style  of the body, level 1 heading, and paragraph.</li>
                        <li>Experiment with removing some of the CSS punctuation (such as the brackets, the colon, or the semicolon).</li>

                	<li>It was not complete and not easy to use. I thought it would be best to link to a site that addresses that ever-changing issue specifically rather than trying to list them all ourselves (when we couldnâ€™t).
