        <h2>Writing for the Web with HTML</h2>
        <div class="todo">This page is <strong>ready for review</strong> (BH has reviewed). Please note that I made this the most mellow of intros to HTML&mdash;basically just enough so that the <code>http</code> block report isn't totally incomprehensible. I used Paul's suggestion to "use an online two-view tool" (I chose w3school's because I find that site easy to use.) See what you think. --MF</div>
        <div class="todo">
        	PG original remarks: 
            <ul>
            	<li>first problem is that kids have no idea what they <em>should</em> be expecting to find in a web page, or even that a web page uses a programming language to organize the elements (pictures and text) on the page and create the buttons that we click, <em>just as they've created buttons to click in Snap</em>.</li>
                <li>what I <em>really</em> think should happen is that students use an online two-view tool, code and image, and build a simple web page, perhaps for their school or interest or... With text and a graphic and (perhaps) a button or some other whizzy feature, and <em>then</em> look at some page we build (or some other) to see if they can find such features.  Or something. A low level part of the purpose of this page is to show what's under the hood of a web page (for which they don't need Snap), to show that they can see the source of a page (for which they don't need Snap), and to show that they can <em>get</em> that source with Snap so that they can process it for some purpose (like weather app, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
			How's this page for addressing these concerns? --MF

        <div class="todo">From Observation Notes Analysis: 
        	<ul>
                <li>U4L1: "There's a lot of reading and mucking around with the w3schools page, but I didn't feel like students learned much about CS today outside the work on CITN. The details on "tags" really didn't seem to help advance the curriculum."</li>
                <li>U4L1: "I feel like we're not doing much with this particular lesson. Why are we teaching this? Is it an AP standard to learn or understand HTML? I get that we need to pick through an HTML page to find goodies, but it seems like we could do that without having people know all the details."</li>
                <li>U4L1: "The W3 HTML interface seemed to work very smoothly for students (though the instructions they were given didn't lead to interesting insights)."</li>
                <li>U4L1: "Writing HTML: we need to clarify the basics of HTML more explicitly (like opening and closing tags and the difference between the head and the body—these are probably the most important). As I recall, a lot of what I'd originally included on this page was cut during revisions, but I think we need some of it back to help students get to some relevant insights (the most fundamental to using HTML in Snap!)."</li>
				<li>U4L1: "Also ned more very basics of HTML in TG. Teacher said some wrong things about HTML such as "p" is for "new paragraph" (not exactly) and "b" is for "line break" (wrong)."</li>
				<li>U4L1: "Instead of using the w3schools example, we should have them copy/paste a View Source into that window. Then they can see both the HTML and the result together. Personally, I would copy/paste the Weather App page (from weatherstreet.com) but maybe something else? Mary felt the Weather App page, which does load and is visible (other than Javascript) is too complicated, but we're going to be very quickly moving to that anyway."</li>
                <li>U4L1: "One student shared some confusion about how the W3 editor worked. Students explained how it worked. Several compared it to Snap! suggesting the WYSIWYG side on the right is like the Snap! stage."</li>
                <li>U4L1: "W3 site is working well with these students also. Some have had some exposure to HTML and made some cute additions (such as adding a background image to the page)."</li>
                <li>U4L1: "Selective changes to HTML example tasks to help highlight essentials of HTML needed for importing into Snap!."</li>
            </ul>
            A few meta-notes on these comments: there are so many because two people watched two classes on this page (for a total of 4 observations of this one page). The negative comments about the page are all from one person. And for transparency, the person disclaiming this both wrote the page and wants to keep it. ;) --MF

		<p>Unlike Snap<em>!</em>, which is a general purpose programming language, HTML is a <em>special purpose programming language</em>; it's designed for a specific task: programming web pages. There are many sites on the Internet that can help you learn to create web pages. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a> is one example.</p>

					<div class="todo">Hex isn't in our curriculum yet, but it should be (EK 2.1.1D and EK 2.1.1F). I think we should add it to U1L5 near binary when we clean up that Lab, which needs attention for coherence to itself. Then it can come up again in U4 both here with this brief intro to HTML/CSS and then again with IPv4. For now, I'm just putting in a simple, fun link for anyone who wonders what hex is. --MF</div>
                    <ol>
                    	<div class="todo">There's no such thing as a hexadecimal number!  If we're going to link to an external site it has to be one that's accurate.  (We already went through this discussion long ago about binary and CS Unplugged.) --bh<ul><li>Brian, is your primary concern that the page uses the term "hexadecimal number"? While I agree that it's not correct, it is a very commonly used term (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal" target="_blank">wikipedia.org</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/applying-math-reasoning-topic/alternate-number-bases/v/hexadecimal-number-system" target="_blank">khanacademy.org</a>) and it's going to be hard to find any site that does something nice and accessible that doesn't use the term. We haven't covered HEX yet or HEX colors (though I think we should by this point), so students need something here to explain what that is at least for year 1. If not this, then what do you suggest? --MF
                    	      <ul>
                    	        <li>Well, you can argue with Al about it. But I'm on Al's side; I think wrong terminology confuses people. In this case, many students will end up thinking that, e.g., colors can be represented <em>only</em> in hex, because hex numbers are different from &quot;regular&quot; numbers. It would help to show the same color represented as a decimal number, then explain how colors are made out of red, green, and blue intensities and show how hex is a more useful representation because you can see the parts easily. But they could have made colors look like IP addresses: 255.255.255 for white, 0.255.0 for green, etc. (PS The Wikipedia article you cite used &quot;numeral&quot; almost all the time when appropriate; I fixed the few erroneous &quot;number&quot;s. I take no responsibility for Khan Academy. ☺)</li>

Experiment with style  of the body, level 1 heading, and paragraph.</li>
