        <h2>Need An Umbrella?</h2>
        <p>In this activity, you'll build an <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/umbrella.png" alt="UMBRELLA? block"> predicate that tells you if you'll need an umbrella today.</p>
        
        <p>But wait, doesn't this block need an input to say where you are? Nope: your IP address contains information about your location!</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Determine your computer's <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-protocols/1-ip-routing.html">IP address</a>.<div class="sidenote">Perhaps you already have a block that finds your IP address?</div></li>
                <li>Edit the following URL, replacing the IP address with your own: <code>http://ipinfo.io/72.229.28.185</code>. What information does that page give you?</li>
                <li>Use Snap<em>!</em> to retrieve your location from that web page.</li>
                <div class="sidenote">Some of the information might have slight inaccuracies. IP addresses often give the location of an Internet service provider, usually from a nearby location.</div>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>The amount of detailed information available from an IP address is pretty amazing (and a little scary), especially when you think about the ways that information can be used.</p>

        	<div class="comment">PG: I looked first for a "details" link or tab, then tried the <em>developers</em> link in response to "read the details on ipinfo.io..." Not finding /loc, I almost gave up. <em><strong>OH!</strong></em> That's the info we're getting in "Try the JSON API from the command line." <em><strong>That</strong></em> is far from obvious, since the student at this point doesn't know the meaning of JSON or API or "command line," and, furthermore, has every reason, once seeing "$ curl, blah..." to assume it's random stuff to be ignored, or that, at best, the labels in it are just labels, not things that can go in a URL. Edited to give specific tags to the student. -- BK

        By viewing the source HTML for the page, you can devise a plan for extracting the right information from it.</p>
        
        <div class="takeNote">Some Web sites also have ways for users to obtain more direct information. Read the details on <code>ipinfo.io</code>, and you'll find some really nice ways to directly extract the information you need. For example, <code>ipinfo.io/72.229.28.185/loc</code> returns just a latitude and longitude, instead of an HTML page. Check out <code>ipinfo.io/72.229.28.185/city</code>, <code>/state</code>, and <code>/postal</code> for ideas.</div>

        <li>Build the <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/umbrella.png" alt="UMBRELLA? block"> block by using IP information as input to Weatherstreet.
