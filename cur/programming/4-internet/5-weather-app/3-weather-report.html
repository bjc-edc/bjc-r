        <h2>Building A Weather Report (Teacher's Choice)</h2>
        <p>Now you can query Weatherstreet for current temperature and weather conditions.  </p>
        
        <div class="ifTime" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Use the methods you used in the <a href="/bjc-r-2017-18/cur/programming/3-lists/1-introduction-to-lists/1-shopping-list-app.html">shopping list app</a> to build a block that lets you  type in a list of multiple cities and states.</li>
                <li>Then use your current temperature and weather conditions blocks to build a weather report for multiple cities.
                	<ol>
                        <li>If there were only one city in the list, what could you do to produce the report?</li>
                        <li>Use list operations to produce the weather report, then test it on other cities.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>

        <p>
            The weather report should take a list of cities like this...<br />
			<div class="sidenote">As part of this work you can choose to create "cleaner" entry of city names. To do this, you'll need to convert names like <strong>New York, NY</strong> to <strong>New+York,NY</strong>. Snap<em>!</em> blocks that convert words to lists, and lists to words, can make this possible.

        </p>
        
        <p>
            ... and produce a report like this:<br />
