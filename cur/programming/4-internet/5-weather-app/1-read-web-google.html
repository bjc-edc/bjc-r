        <div class="todo">Hi Bowen, When BH reviewed the pages I've been working on (including L1p2 where I copied this to), he said, "Any reason we're using google.com (boo!) instead of duckduckgo.com (yay!)?" It might not apply here anymore since I'll be covering some of this, but just in case, I'm tucking the comment here too... --MF</div>

          <p>Can we search for something other than "snap"? It's weird to me that it goes to a food bank page... --MF</p>
          <p>We certainly <em>can</em>. Stuff like that is always a choice we can make (it isn't essential AP, CS, or pedagogy). I don't find it weird, and I  even see it as potential a positive value, but it is also a potential political hot-button that could interfere with our mission to the very same kids that the government SNAP program is designed to serve. I worry some about that, but the fact that a search turns up <em>many</em> things, though, makes this seem safe. And, speaking of weird, did you notice that one is from 55 Chapel Street, Newton?! </p>
		  <p>I don't have a requirement to use "snap" here, I just thought it was clever. Berkeley Snap shows up on that page, too, but it's not the top hit. -BK</p>
