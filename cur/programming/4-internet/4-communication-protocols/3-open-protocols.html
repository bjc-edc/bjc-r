		<p>These are all <strong>open standards</strong>. Anyone can look up an open protocol's details and code them into new hardware and software without any permission. This allows for more manufacting of devices to support the growth of the Internet.</p>
        <div class="sidenote">Before the Internet, there were several different network protocols that were secrets belonging to particular manufacturers. So if you had a particular brand of computer or router, it could talk only to other computers of the same brand.</div>

						<li><strong>TCP</strong>: Transmission Control Protocol&mdash;the protocol that <em>assures reliable transmission</em> of data</li>
						<li><strong>IP</strong>: Internet Protocol&mdash;the hierarchical addressing protocol that <em>manages routing</em> of data between computers; IPv4&nbsp;addressing didn't have enough numbers, so we are upgrading to IPv6 </li>
