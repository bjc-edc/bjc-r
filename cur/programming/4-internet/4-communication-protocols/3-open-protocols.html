                <li>
                	I've added the FTYD and editted the "Internet Abstraction Hierarchy

        	So far, you've learned about three Internet protocols:
			<ul>
                <li><strong>HTTP</strong>: HyperText Transfer Protocol&mdash;the protocol that your computer uses when <em>accessing an HTML web site</em></li>
                <li><strong>IP</strong>: Internet Protocol&mdash;the protocol that <em>manages routing</em> (finding paths to distant computers) </li>
                <li><strong>TCP</strong>: Transmission Control Protocol&mdash;the protocol that <em>assures reliable transmission</em> of data</li>
			</ul>
        </p>
        <p>
			There are a <em>lot</em> of protocols! Here's a picture from Wikipedia:<br />
			<div class="sidenote">You don't have to know about all of these!</div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/IP-suite.png" alt="The Internet protocol suite">
        </p>

        <p>These are all <strong>open standards</strong>, which means that anyone can look up their details and build them into new hardware and software without getting permission. (For example, here is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791" target="_blank">the IPv4 specification</a>, but don't read it now.)</p>
        <p>(Before the Internet, there were several different network protocols that were secrets belonging to particular manufacturers. So if you had a particular brand of computer or router, it could talk only to other computers of the same brand.)</p>
        <p>Open protocols are another reason why the Internet is <em>scalable</em>.</p>

            	The Internet is probably the largest and most complicated artifact in human history. And it relies on <em><strong>cooperation</strong>.</em> Just think: 
                <ul>
                    <li>You can send email to someone in a country that's considered an enemy of your country (from the US to Iran, for example).</li>
                    <li>An engineer at Microsoft can read a web page at Apple even though their companies are competitors.</li>
                    <li>Your T-Mobile cell phone can talk to your friend's Verizon phone.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Despite some governments' attempts to censor the net, the big picture is one of strong cooperative spirit!</p>
