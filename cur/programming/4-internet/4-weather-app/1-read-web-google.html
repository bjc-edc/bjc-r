        <h2>Reading Data Using URL Tags</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>Hi Bowen, Here are the Data EKs I think should be covered in this lab. I look forward to your thoughts. :)MF</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EK3.2.1A</strong> Large data sets provide opportunities and challenges for extracting information and knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>EK3.2.1B</strong> Large data sets provide opportunities for identifying trends, making connections in data, and solving problems.</li>
                <li><strong>EK3.2.1C</strong> Computing tools facilitate the discovery of connections in information within large data sets.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

		<div class="sidenote">The term <strong>URL</strong> is short for <em>Uniform Resource Locator</em>, a reference to an Internet resource such as a Web page.</div>
        <p>Many websites, such as Google, communicate information in the details in their URLs.</p>
        
        <div class="todo">Hi Bowen, When BH reviewed the pages I've been working on (including L1p2 where I copied this to), he said, "Any reason we're using google.com (boo!) instead of duckduckgo.com (yay!)?" It might not apply here anymore since I'll be covering some of this, but just in case, I'm tucking the comment here too... --MF</div>
        
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Starting from <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">www.google.com</a>, type a one-word web search. What is the URL of your current web page?</li>
                <li>Change your URL to make Google search for a new topic.</li>
                <li>Experiment to figure out how Google handles multiple-word web searches in URLs.</li>

        <div class="sidenote">When you see <code>https</code> instead of <code>http</code>, it means the information exchanged is secured via encryption.</div>
        
        <p>Your URL may add some details, but one of the simplest formats is <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=snap" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/#q=snap</a>.</p>

		<div class="comment">BK: Need to prepare a more specific project base in #4. I have one, I just need to know the "rules" for setting these up and making them load, so for now I'm using the "read-web" project base.</div>
        
        <div class="comment">
          <p>Can we search for something other than "snap"? It's weird to me that it goes to a food bank page... --MF</p>
          <p>We certainly <em>can</em>. Stuff like that is always a choice we can make (it isn't essential AP, CS, or pedagogy). I don't find it weird, and I  even see it as potential a positive value, but it is also a potential political hot-button that could interfere with our mission to the very same kids that the government SNAP program is designed to serve. I worry some about that, but the fact that a search turns up <em>many</em> things, though, makes this seem safe. And, speaking of weird, did you notice that one is from 55 Chapel Street, Newton?! </p>
		  <p>I don't have a requirement to use "snap" here, I just thought it was clever. Berkeley Snap shows up on that page, too, but it's not the top hit. -BK</p>

		<p>The intent here is to return the HTML, no scraping involved. It won't return a fully useful result, partially because Google doesn't give you a very good style of return page. -BK</p>
