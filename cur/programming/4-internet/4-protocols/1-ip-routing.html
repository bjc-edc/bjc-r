			<p>Routers are networking devices that direct traffic between subnetworks on the internet. The word "router" is pronounced like "doubter."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The computer you're using is almost certainly part of a wired (Ethernet) or wireless (WiFi) <strong>local network</strong> connecting the computers in your house or your school. The networking hardware in your computer can only talk to other computers on the same local network. How it is that you can use the Internet to connect to any computer in the world?</p>
        <p>One (or maybe more) of the computers on your network is a <strong>router</strong>: a special purpose computer that passes messages from one network to another. If you have a router at home, it probably connects your local network with a larger network belonging to your Internet Service Provider (ISP), generally your telephone company or your cable TV company. The job of a router is to pass messages from one network to another until it reaches the local network of the computer you're trying to reach. Your home router connects only two networks, your local net and your ISP's net. Your ISP has many routers, each of which connects several networks.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Internet</strong> isn't a network of computers; it's a <em>network of networks.</em></p>
        <p>
        	How do the routers know where to find the computer you want? Every computer on the Internet (including smart phones, routers, Internet-enabled appliances, etc.) has an address (or more than one, if it's a router), like a postal or email address, called its <strong>IP address</strong>. IP stands for <strong>Internet Protocol</strong>. (A protocol is a set of rules for communicating on the net; IP is the protocol that specifies how a router handles a request for another IP address.) You can find out your computer's IP address by asking a search engine:<br />
        	<center><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=my+ip+address" target="_blank">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=my+ip+address</a></center>
        </p>
        <div class="endnote">
        	<p>
            	<strong>What's DuckDuckGo?</strong>  
                It's a search engine, like Google or Bing, except that it doesn't track your searches to sell you to advertisers as the others do. You saw it in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/5-search-internet/1-getting-started.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment"> Unit 3 Lab 5</a>.

				The "?q=" tells the duckduckgo.com server to run the query "my+ip+address," which returns the client's (your) IP address. (The "q" is for "query" as we are querying the server for information.)

	    <h3>IP Address Hierarchy</h3>
		<div class="todo">
            <ul>
        		<li>The following was constructed from Dan's internet PPTX and Brian's to original IP Page --MF</li>
                <li>
                    Next year, the text and graphic below should be changed to snap.berkeley.edu at 128.32.189.18. See Dan's PPTX files on Internet (<a href="http://cs10.org/sp15/lecture/L15%20-%20Internet%20I/" target="_blank">one</a> and <a href="http://cs10.org/sp15/lecture/L16%20-%20Internet%20II/" target="_blank">two</a>) to modify. --MF
                    <ul>
                        <li>I recognize that it's not as simple as "just changing to snap.berkeley.edu" because servers have all these funny rerouting things going on (and york might actually be where snap is, etc.). Brian, we should talk about this. (Or just leave me a comment here or in my inbox about it. Thanks!) --MF
                          <ul>
                            <li>snap.b.e is complicated; it's translated to byob.eecs.b.e which is in turn translated to eecs.b.e/~bh/byob. It'd be a little easier to talk about bjc.b.e, which is called bjc throughout the translation steps. But in the end they both are the same computer as eecs.b.e, namely 128.32.244.183. So you could legitimately ignore all that referral stuff and just say snap.b.e is 128.32.244.183. If you want a nearby computer for comparison, the one on my desk, abbenay.cs.b.e, is 128.32.153.200. Where did 128.32.189.18 come from?--bh</li>

		<div class="sidenoteBig">Recall, a <em>hierarchy</em> is an ranking arrangement (like species taxonomy) with the broadest or most powerful rank at the top. It's often depicted as a pyramid.</div>
        <p><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/take-turns-speaking-mini.gif" alt="Take turns speaking" title="Take turns speaking"> Like domain names, IP addresses are <em>hierarchical</em>.</p>
        <p>For example, consider the IP address for york.cs.berkeley.edu, which is 128.32.156.218. In the picture below, the subnetwork for the 128.32 domain includes two subnet numbers: 189 and 156. Subnet 156 has two hosts: 218 and 226.</p>

	    <h3>IPv4</h3>
        <p>Each of the four numbers in a typical IP address today is an eight-bit <strong>byte</strong> with a value between 0 and 255:</p>
        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/ipv4.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="IPv4" title="IPv4" /><br />
        <p>A 32-bit IPv4 (the &quot;v&quot; stands for &quot;version&quot;) address is big enough to support 2<sup>32</sup> computers, which is about four billion (4 &middot; 10<sup>6</sup>). There are more than <em>seven</em> billion people on Earth, so there aren't enough IP addresses to go around.</p>
        <div class="endnote"><strong>Why 2<sup>32</sup>?</strong> There are 32 bits, and each bit can be one of two possible values (0 or 1). So, there are two possibilities for the first bit, four (that's 2<sup>2</sup>) possibilities for the first two bits, eight (that's 2<sup>3</sup>) possibilities for the first three bits, 16 (that's 2<sup>4</sup>) for the first four bits, and so on up to 2<sup>32</sup> possibilities for thirty-two bits.</div>
	
    
        <h3>IPv6</h3>
        <p>The long-term solution is to increase the length of an IP address. The new IP addresses are 128 bits wide, which is enough to support 2<sup>128</sup> computers:</p>
		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/ipv6.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="IPv6" title="IPv6" />
        
		<div class="endnote">2<sup>128</sup> is about 10<sup>38</sup>. For contrast, there are about 10<sup>50</sup> atoms in the Earth and an estimated 10<sup>29</sup> stars in the observable universe. So even if the Internet is extended to include other planets or space aliens, we'll <em>still</em> have enough addresses with IPv6 (but not if every atom had its own IP address).</div>

        <div class="takeNote"> Different protocols can be used at the same time; both IPv4 and IPv6 are in use today.  This is a great example of the importance of abstraction. Most traffic (even traffic across new routers capable of IPv6) still uses IPv4. This is because in order to make an IPv6 connection, all the routers along the way must recognize IPv6.  Old routers are replaced all the time, and eventually every router on the Internet will use IPv6.</div>

You can't, unfortunately, do it by asking DuckDuckGo as you did earlier, because you'd have to use the <code>proxied http://</code> block, and so you'd get back the address of the proxy site instead of your own. So instead, use <a href="http://alonzo.herokuapp.com/ip-address" target="_blank">alonzo.herokuapp.com/ip-address</a>, which allows connections from the unproxied <code>http://</code> block.                You'll use this block in Lab 5, to write a program that checks the weather where you are, without having to ask you where you are; it can tell (pretty closely) from your IP address.</li>

			<div class="endnote">Most likely, the router in your home or school uses a protocol that allows all the computers on a local network (for example, in one building) to share one IP address on the Internet<!--, which can be cheaper-->. The router that creates the local network gives each computer a <em>local address</em>. For example, although the outside world may think someone's computer has IP address 108.26.181.226, that computer itself probably thinks its address is something like 192.168.1.11.</div>

            <div class="endnote">The 192.168 <em>domain</em> (the block of IP addresses that all start with 192.168) is reserved for local networks; no computer on the Internet has an address in that range.  <!--So, the job of the router is not really as simple as the end-to-end abstraction would suggest.

                <li>                  The <strong>end-to-end principle</strong> is abstraction, in the particular case of the Internet hierarchy.  It says that routers don't have to know anything about the meaning or purpose of the messages you send over the net; all they care about is the IP address at the beginning of the message.  Your computer and the server to which you sent the message are the only ones that have to think about what it means.
                    As a result, when someone invents a new application for the Internet, all the routers in the world don't have to be replaced or reprogrammed &mdash; to them it's all just bits.

                	<div class="commentBig">Robustness not in standards, but ideas added to Network Redundancy section of Lab 1 Page 1. --MF</div>
                    <strong>Robustness</strong> is the technical name for the redundancy of paths through the Internet,  It means that if part of the net fails, the rest of the net remains connected even if the failed part is in the usual path from one place to another.
                </li>
                <li>Robustness and the end-to-end principle improve Internet <strong>scalability</strong>, which is the ability of the net to keep working as the size of the network and the amount of traffic over the network increase. (The page <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2013/01/16/internet-2012-in-numbers/" target="_blank">Internet 2012 in numbers</a> has some astonishing numbers about Internet traffic from a few years ago.)</li>
                <li>
                	<div class="commentBig">Ideas used in TCP. --MF</div>
                    A <strong>packet</strong> is a small message.  Typically, if you want to send a <em>large</em> message, your computer divides it into small chunks that it sends individually.  This is important because if a router that's handling a chunk of your message fails, only that chunk has to be resent, rather than the entire message.  The Internet is a <strong>packet switching</strong> network.  (By contrast, land line telephone systems establish a long-term connection from one telephone to another, for as long as the phone call continues.)

                <li>
                	<div class="commentBig">This is not in the standards. --MF</div>
                    Another name for a packet switching network is a <strong>store-and-forward</strong> network, because each router along the way stores your packet long enough to forward it to the next router.

	                These are all <strong>open standards</strong>, which means that anyone can look up their details and build them into new hardware and software without getting permission.  (For example, here is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791" target="_blank">the IPv4 specification</a>, but don't read it now.) Before the Internet, there were several different network protocols that were secrets belonging to particular manufacturers. So if you had a particular brand of computer or router, it could talk only to other computers of the same brand. Open protocols are another reason why the Internet is scalable.

		<div class="takeNote">
            <p><strong>What's with the three decimal points in IP addresses?</strong> They're not really decimal points; the four numbers that they separate are eight-bit <strong>bytes</strong> with values between 0 and 255.  There are four of them in an IP address because at the time the Internet Protocol was designed, most computers had four-byte (32-bit) arithmetic and storage units.  The 32-bit address is divided into bytes because addresses are assigned in hierarchical groups in groups of 2<sup>8</sup>, 2<sup>16</sup>, or 2<sup>24</sup>.  For example, the 2<sup>16</sup> IP addresses 128.32.<em>anything</em>.<em>anything</em> are assigned to the University of California, Berkeley, and are located in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department.  The computer on my desk at Berkeley is 128.32.153.200.  Berkeley also has other address ranges assigned; the server for berkeley.edu is at 169.229.216.200 and the entire address range 169.229.<em>anything</em>.<em>anything</em> belongs to Berkeley.  Groups that made their reservations early have bigger blocks of addresses; for example, all of 18.<em>anything</em>.<em>anything</em>.<em>anything</em> belongs to MIT.</p>
            <p>A 32-bit IP address is big enough to support 2<sup>32</sup> computers, which is about four billion.  There are more than seven billion people on Earth, so there aren't enough addresses to go around.  (Not everyone has a computer, yet, but some people have more than one, and some computers don't belong to individuals.)  People have invented clever short-term solutions that allow, for example, every computer on a local network to share the same IP address; see the Take It Further at the end of this page.</p>
            <p>The long-term solution is to increase the size of an IP address. Most computers today use 64-bit numbers, so that would be a natural address size to use, but the Internet designers decided they didn't want their grandchildren to have to redesign IP again, so the new IP addresses are 128 bits wide.  2<sup>128</sup> is about 10<sup>38</sup>. By contrast, there are about 10<sup>50</sup> atoms in the Earth, and an estimated 10<sup>29</sup> stars in the observable universe. So we're probably okay even when the Internet is extended to include space aliens, but another IP revision might be needed when every atom has its own Internet connection!</p>
            <div class="takeItFurther"> Discuss: Will people ever be able to build a computer inside a single atom?</div>
            <p>The 32-bit version of IP is called <strong>IP version 4 (IPv4)</strong>, and the 128-bit version is <strong>IPv6</strong>. A great example of the importance of abstraction is that different protocols can be used at each of the four levels of the Internet abstraction hierarchy, and both IPv4 and IPv6 are in use today.  Most traffic still uses IPv4, because in order to make an IPv6 connection, all the routers along the way must recognize IPv6.  Old routers are replaced all the time anyway, because newer ones are faster, so eventually every router on the Internet will use IPv6. The switch from IPv4 to IPv6 is just one example of the fact that protocols in the Internet hierarchy are changing all the time.</p>

                The lines numbered 3-6 are routers (notice "rtr" in most of their names) belonging to USC.  Line 7 is interesting; it is registered to an organization named "Los Nettos" (that's the "ln" in its name), but its official representative has a USC email address.
                <div class="takeItFurther"> How do I know that?  Do a web search for "whois" to find out.</div>
                <p>Line 8 is also interesting.  Its name ends with "ntt.net," which means that it belongs to NTT Communications in Tokyo, Japan!  But that doesn't mean our message went through Japan; this specific router is located in Englewood, Colorado.</p>
                <div class="takeItFurther"> How do I know that?  Do a web search for "geolocation" to find out.</div>
                <p>Line 9 is another ntt.net router, but this one is in Los Angeles.  My message has gone from California to Colorado and then back to California!  (Note that the router's name includes "lsanca"&mdash;Los Angeles, California.</p>
                <div class="todo">PG: I could reproduce very little of this. When I searched whois, I got a list of sites, the first of which never loaded. (As a kid, I won't know why, or whether I'm supposed to wait, or I did something wrong.) When I tried another, I tried looking up ln, which gave me something but not an answer that fit with what is said about "interesting" line 7. By then, I wasn't interested to try more. Googling geolocation gives me a bunch of things—Wikipedia, Mozilla, etc.—and nothing that (easily) tells me more. Not that everything needs to be easy, but the double whammy of having a list of places to look and little readable in each place I do look damps my motivation. And, alas, I never find out what geolocation is. What part of this is the essential part?  How can we get to it more easily? OR, better question, how can we tell the interesting parts of decoding the traceroute with experiments a random kid could reliably perform? <p>Finally, I tried giganews. It tells us something to note, and recommends we "use the server that gives the best performance." What can I <em>do</em> with that information?  What does it <em>mean</em>?  Parts of this could be elucidating for <em>us</em>, but I think it would be nearly totally obscure for kids—too much unknown in the first place, and too deeply encoded to read even the parts one might know. </p>
                <p>This might be a place to note what "30 hops max, 60 byte packets" is trying to tell us, and what the interspersed ip addresses and ms reports are saying (kids probably don't know what ms means nor do numbers like 216.166.98.3 yet feel "recognizable" as <em>having</em> a meaning as "oh, that's a device." But it feels to me like <em>so</em> many unknowns to get through—what's a hop, what is <em>max</em>, what's a byte, what's a packet, what does that all tell me, what's ms, what are all the other words like 10gigabitethernet2-2.core1.ash1.he.net, which are slightly explained but all still new—to make sense of.</p>
                </div>
                <p>On line 10, the message passes from NTT to Verizon, my Internet Service Provider.  I'm not sure where the router is actually located; one geolocation service tells me it's in Los Angeles, but another says it's in Missouri.</p>
                <p>After that, the asterisks on lines 11-13 mean that the routers aren't responding to traceroute messages, so we don't know the exact path once the message is inside the Verizon network.</p></li>

        Notice that hops 7, 8, 9, and 11 show three different results.  Traceroute generally tries three times (this is one of the reasons it takes so long for traceroute servers to respond) and show you three response times in milliseconds for each hop.  Sometimes the three tries end up going through different routes.  In this case, the differences are minor; all those routers are probably located in the same room.  But occasionally there's a power failure somewhere along the way, and then you  might see dramatically different ways a message can travel from there to here.

                <li>A more detailed explanation of the Internet protocol hierarchy is in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-web-data/B2B-Appendix.pdf" target="_blank">the Appendix</a> to <em>Blown to Bits</em>.</li>
                <li>We did say this was a simplified picture, so it wasn't exactly a lie when we said a web search would reveal your computer's Internet address. &#x263a; Most likely, the router in your home or school uses <strong>Network Address Translation (NAT)</strong>, a protocol that allows all the computers on a local network to share one IP address, as seen from outside the network. The router that creates the local network gives each computer a <em>local address</em>. For example, although the outside world thinks the computer at which I'm typing this has IP address 108.26.181.226, my computer itself thinks its address is 192.168.1.11. The 192.168 <strong>domain</strong> (a range of IP addresses) is reserved for local networks; no computer on the Internet "really" has an address in that range.  As a result of NAT and other complications added to solve efficiency or security problems, the job of the router is not really as simple as the end-to-end principle ideally suggests.</li>
