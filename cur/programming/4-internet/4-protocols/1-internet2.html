        <h2>A Brief History of the Internet</h2>

        <p>The beginnings of the Internet were designed in the 1960s with the connection of the first 4 computers of what was then called the Arpanet. Since then, the number of people connected to the internet has been increasing exponentially. These days, several different systems of communication run on the Internet:
            <ul>
                <li>Email was invented in the early 1960s.</li>
                <li>The World Wide Web wasn't invented until over 20 years later, in 1989.</li>
                <li>Search engines for the Web were created in 1993. Before that, there was a complete list of all servers, which would not be realistic today!</li>
                <li>The term "Web 2.0" was coined in 1999 to describe a gradual shift in the use of the Web technology from a style in which almost all content was generated by large corporations to one in which individual users could post content (blogs, photos, etc.), leading to a revival of the social networking that had been common on the Internet prior to the development of the Web.</li>
            </ul>
