<div class="todo">FROM BH 12/9 email:<br />
        All the stuff about abstraction and the protocol stack belongs earlier, in L3.   Maybe so does the who's in charge page.  What belongs in here is:
        <p>Any DNS server can provide a "non-authoritative" address for any domain. <div class="sidenoteBig">DNS <em>has to</em> work that way, because otherwise every connection to any computer in the world would have to go through the top-level node that provides authoritative addresses for COM, EDU, etc.</div>  So, we all rely on every nameserver being honest, and sometimes they aren't.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Examples: Governments use dishonest routing information to suppress certain sites inside their country.  Anyone can use dishonest routing information to sabotage a domain, or to steal passwords by sending you to fake sites.</div>
        <div class="sidenoteBig">The net protocols were designed back when hardly anyone was connected to the Internet, and everyone trusted everyone else.<br />
        - Today, achieving both security and efficiency at the same time will require a major redesign of the entire protocol stack.<br />
        - A secure Internet could easily end up preventing anonymous publishing.  To prevent fraud, it's important to be able to verify the source of a message. But if the source of a message can be verified, the message can't be anonymous.  That's problematic both for privacy and for freedom of speech.<br /></div>

		<p>Software has bugs.  People can use those bugs for bad purposes, crashing your computer or implanting spy software in it to collect everything you type, including passwords.  Software developers try to prevent security bugs, and to fix them when they turn up, but not every software developer distributes fixes promptly.  (It's especially a problem on smartphones.  If you have an Android phone, and a security bug is found, Google fixes it, but they don't send the fix directly to your phone; they send new system releases to phone manufacturers, who may take some time to install local modifications available only on their phones, then send the modified Android code to carriers, who also take some time to install carrier-specific modifications.  Security fixes can come more quickly on iOS phones, because Apple can send updates to you directly, no matter which carrier you use.)  The general name for programs that try to affect your computer badly is "malware."</p>
        <p>One kind of malware is called a "virus."  Computer viruses make copies of themselves, just as biological viruses do, and try to spread themselves over the network to other computers.</p>
        <p>One of the easiest ways to make trouble on the net is called a "Denial of Service" (DoS) attack.  This consists simply of sending a lot of requests at once to a server, to try to swamp its network bandwidth.  A DoS attack doesn't destroy data or collect passwords; it just causes a temporary inability to reach the targeted server.  A variant is the "Distributed Denial of Service" (DDoS) attack, in which the attacker first uses viruses or similar self-spreading software to take control of many (sometimes tens of thousands) computers around the world, then launches a DoS attack from all of them at once.  Besides increasing the number of simultaneous server requests, DDoS makes it harder to determine who is at fault, since the attack seems to come from many innocent people.</p>
