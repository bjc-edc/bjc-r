            The trust model of the internet involves tradeoffs.<br />
            DNS insecure<br />
            security has sw, hw, and human components<br />
            cyber warfare and cyber crime bad<br />
            DDoS<br />
            Phishing, viruses, etc have human and sw components<br />
            AV sw, firewalls help<br />
            Crypyo<br />
            Crypto uses math<br />
            Open standards help security<br />
            symmetric vs public key<br />
            CAs require trust<br />

		<p>Software has bugs.  People can use those bugs for bad purposes, crashing your computer or implanting spy software in it to collect everything you type, including passwords.  Software developers try to prevent security bugs, and to fix them when they turn up, but not every software developer distributes fixes promptly.  (It's especially a problem on smartphones.  If you have an Android phone, and a security bug is found, Google fixes it, but they don't send the fix directly to your phone; they send new system releases to phone manufacturers, who may take some time to install local modifications available only on their phones, then send the modified Android code to carriers, who also take some time to install carrier-specific modifications.  Security fixes can come more quickly on iOS phones, because Apple can send updates to you directly, no matter which carrier you use.)  The general name for programs that try to affect your computer badly is "malware."</p>
        <p>One kind of malware is called a "virus."  Computer viruses make copies of themselves, just as biological viruses do, and try to spread themselves over the network to other computers.</p>
        <p>One of the easiest ways to make trouble on the net is called a "Denial of Service" (DoS) attack.  This consists simply of sending a lot of requests at once to a server, to try to swamp its network bandwidth.  A DoS attack doesn't destroy data or collect passwords; it just causes a temporary inability to reach the targeted server.  A variant is the "Distributed Denial of Service" (DDoS) attack, in which the attacker first uses viruses or similar self-spreading software to take control of many (sometimes tens of thousands) computers around the world, then launches a DoS attack from all of them at once.  Besides increasing the number of simultaneous server requests, DDoS makes it harder to determine who is at fault, since the attack seems to come from many innocent people.</p>
