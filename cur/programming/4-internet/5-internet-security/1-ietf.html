        <h2>Who's In Charge?</h2>
        <div class="todo">FROM BH 12/9 email:<br />
        All the stuff about abstraction and the protocol stack belongs earlier, in L3.   Maybe so does the who's in charge page.  What belongs in here is:<br />
        - Remember how any DNS server can provide a "non-authoritative" address for any domain?  DNS /has to/ work that way, because otherwise every connection to any computer in the world would have to go through the top-level node that provides authoritative addresses for COM, EDU, etc.  But it means we all rely on every nameserver being honest, and sometimes they aren't.  Governments use dishonest routing information to suppress certain sites inside their country.  Anyone can use dishonest routing information to sabotage a domain, or to steal passwords by sending you to fake sites.  The net protocols were designed back when hardly anyone was connected to the Internet, and everyone trusted everyone else.<br />
        - Achieving both security and efficiency at the same time will require a major redesign of the entire protocol stack.<br />
        - A secure Internet could easily end up preventing anonymous publishing.  To prevent fraud, it's important to be able to verify the source of a message. But if the source of a message can be verified, the message can't be anonymous.  That's problematic both for privacy and for freedom of speech.<br />
        - Just as TCP enables reliable transmission over an unreliable network, /cryptography/ enables verifiable, secure transmission over an insecure network.<br />
        - Symmetric cryptography, in which the same secret key is used to encrypt and to decrypt a message, has been around for thousands of years.  The trouble with symmetric cryptography is that the sender has to send the /key/ to the receiver before the encrypted message can be understood, and how do you keep the /key/ secret?  The pre-computer solution was to send a trusted messenger (on a horse, in the old days), with instructions to swallow the key if captured.  That melodramatic solution is okay for armies, but your bank has too many customers; messages have to be sent over the Internet.<br />
        - Public key (asymmetric) cryptography is a very recent invention in historical terms, created by several mathematicians in the 1970s.  It uses two different keys for encryption and decryption, and knowing one doesn't let you figure out the other.  Someone who wants to /receive/ secret messages publishes an encryption key (the "public key"), but keeps secret the corresponding decryption key (the "private key").  So, for example, your bank has a public key, and when you enter your password on their web site, your browser uses that key to encrypt the password before sending it over the Internet.  Only the bank can decrypt that message.<br />
        - It's also possible to use the private key for encryption and the public key for decryption.  That's no good for secret messages (why not?), but it's useful for /digital signatures/.  I use my private key to encrypt a message; you use my public key to decrypt it.  If you get a meaningful message as the result, that proves that the message was encrypted with my private key.  (If you want both secrecy and digital signing, there's a protocol for that too, involving several layers of re-encrypting already-encrypted messages.)<br />
        - Software has bugs.  People can use those bugs for bad purposes, crashing your computer or implanting spy software in it to collect everything you type, including passwords.  Software developers try to prevent security bugs, and to fix them when they turn up, but not every software developer distributes fixes promptly.  (It's especially a problem on smartphones.  If you have an Android phone, and a security bug is found, Google fixes it, but they don't send the fix directly to your phone; they send new system releases to phone manufacturers, who may take some time to install local modifications available only on their phones, then send the modified Android code to carriers, who also take some time to install carrier-specific modifications.  Security fixes can come more quickly on iOS phones, because Apple can send updates to you directly, no matter which carrier you use.)  The general name for programs that try to affect your computer badly is "malware."<br />
        - One kind of malware is called a "virus."  Computer viruses make copies of themselves, just as biological viruses do, and try to spread themselves over the network to other computers.<br />
        - One of the easiest ways to make trouble on the net is called a "Denial of Service" (DoS) attack.  This consists simply of sending a lot of requests at once to a server, to try to swamp its network bandwidth.  A DoS attack doesn't destroy data or collect passwords; it just causes a temporary inability to reach the targeted server.  A variant is the "Distributed Denial of Service" (DDoS) attack, in which the attacker first uses viruses or similar self-spreading software to take control of many (sometimes tens of thousands) computers around the world, then launches a DoS attack from all of them at once.  Besides increasing the number of simultaneous server requests, DDoS makes it harder to determine who is at fault, since the attack seems to come from many innocent people.<br />
        - Public key cryptography doesn't solve all the problems, because you might publish a fake public key pretending to be mine.  In practice this is partly fixed by relying on trusted third parties, called Certificate Authorities, to issue public keys.  But that just pushes the problem further back; someone could pretend to be a Certificate Authority!

		<div class="todo">FROM BH: 4.3.2  The code.org video doesn't make the point that not all application-level protocols use TCP.  Sometimes speed of delivery is more important than guaranteed correct delivery, and for that there's UDP.  (I think BtB does talk about this.)</div>
        <p>TCP is not the only "transport layer" protocol.  Another common one is <strong>UDP</strong> (User Datagram Protocol). UDP allows for human-unnoticeable delays and is used for stock trading and online gaming, but it does not try to guarantee reliable delivery.</p>

        <p>The top level of the protocol hierarchy is the <strong>application protocol</strong>. There are lots of these, one for each computer application. You're familiar by now with<strong> HTTP</strong>, the HyperText Transfer Protocol used by Web browsers. Others are <strong>FTP</strong>, the File Transfer Protocol used for sending files between computers, and <strong>IMAP</strong>, the Internet Message Access Protocol, by which the email program on your computer or phone gets your email from whatever server hosts your email account, such as gmail.com or yandex.com.</p>
</div>
        
		<p>As you saw from the traceroute activity earlier, the computers and the interconnections among them don't belong to any one organization. Most of the major Internet Service Providers in the US are telephone companies or cable companies, although typically within a large organization the Internet connections are provided by the organization itself. So who's in charge of the network overall?</p>
        <p>Some people like to believe that nobody's in charge&mdash;that everyone just cooperates freely with no central organization. It's true that free cooperation plays an important role; companies allow competitors' packets to be routed through their systems, for example. But all those protocols didn't just grow in the wild; <em>someone</em> designed IP, designed TCP, and so on. And you can't just pick any IP address or host name you want, or else there would be conflicts. We can't start a server named bjc.org, because that name is already in use (by a health care provider in St. Louis, Missouri).</p>
        <p>The simplest answer, but a somewhat misleading one, is that the US government is in charge, because it has authority over the root zone of the DNS hierarchy. If you think it's strange for one country to control a worldwide network, you're not alone, but we'll get to that shortly. This situation is a result of the history of the creation of the Internet.</p>
        <p>In 1968, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the US Department of Defense, which was at that time the largest funder of computer science research in the world, announced that they were funding development of a large-scale packet switched network. The engineering of the ARPANET was done by a research company, Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN). In 1969 the first connections were made among four university research groups in California and Utah. At its peak, the ARPANET reached a few hundred computers. Individual people and commercial businesses weren't allowed on the net; all those computers were owned either by military installations or by computer science research labs, mostly at universities. (This will be important when we discuss Internet security later.)</p>
        <p>By today's standards the ARPANET was tiny, but it was the testbed for the protocols that became the technical basis for the Internet. And it belonged to the US military. That's how the US came to be in charge of the Internet. Once IP was invented in 1982, the ARPANET itself became just one network among many, and in fact it was decommissioned in 1990. The military installations had been moved to a separate network (but connected to the other networks using IP), and the core of a new cross-country network was built by the National Science Foundation, a civilian agency of the US government, in 1981. At that time businesses still weren't allowed on NSF's CSNET, but there was a clear demand for networking of businesses, and commercial IP-based networks were created. But during all this time, the assignment of both IP addresses and host names were controlled first by ARPA and later by NSF. When the commercial use of the Internet became larger than the research use, that control was passed to the US Department of Commerce, which is still officially in control of the root of the domain namespace and of allocation of IP addresses.</p>
        <p>But in practice the Department of Commerce doesn't run the Internet directly. Instead, they have contracted out various functions to a number of different organizations, some of which are businesses running part of the network for profit, and others are nonprofit organizations. Only very rarely has the US government overruled these organizations. In 2009, the Department of Commerce signed an agreement making the Internet governing bodies more autonomous, although they do still have some contractual obligations to the US.</p>
        <div class="takeNote"><p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is in charge of developing and approving the protocols that make up the Internet protocol suite. IETF members are self-appointed; the work of the IETF is done largely by email among subcommittee members for each protocol, and anyone with the necessary expertise can join these mailing lists. Decisions are made by consensus (everyone has to agree to a change), never by voting. The idea is that if a proposal is controversial enough to need a vote, it should be improved until everyone's objections are satisfied.</p></div>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is the central authority for IP addresses and for top-level domains such as <em>com</em> and <em>edu</em>. ICANN directly manages the root zone of the DNS, but contracts out the management of individual domains to other organizations, usually businesses for the general domains, and of course governments for the two-letter country code domains (although those governments in turn often contract out the management of their domains to businesses).</p>
            <p>Allocation of IP addresses, another ICANN responsibility, has been contracted out to five Regional Internet Registries, roughly one per continent. The one for North America is the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). The regional registries allocate blocks of addresses to Internet Service Providers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p>The Internet Society (ISOC) is a worldwide nonprofit membership society that anyone can join, for free. (Want to be in charge of the Internet? That's how.) It grew out of the IETF, which is an informal group with no official legal status. ISOC is a nonprofit corporation; you can contribute money to it. It is now officially in charge of IETF, and also conducts education and promotes government policies supporting an open Internet.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Other countries have never been happy about the US control of the Internet.  For example, until 2009 all DNS domain names had to use the English alphabet, despite constant requests to accommodate other languages. 2009 was also the year of a large international meeting whose goal was to internationalize Internet governance, but the US didn't cooperate.</p>
        <p>The issue of US control has become much more heated since Edward Snowden's exposure of very extensive spying on Internet traffic by the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013. It's too soon to know how these concerns will eventually be resolved.</p>

Your computer connects to the net through some kind of interface.  If it's a big desktop computer, it might have an <strong>Ethernet</strong> interface attached to a socket on the side or back of the computer, looking like a telephone jack but wider.  A laptop computer might have an Ethernet adaptor, but more likely has a <strong>WiFi</strong> interface attached to an antenna inside the case, connecting to your network <strong>router</strong> box by radio.  Your cell phone uses a longer-range <strong>cellular</strong> connection to your phone carrier.</p>

If you're on a laptop, your local network consists of all the machines with WiFi connections to the same router, also typically very near each other.</p>
                    <p>Somewhere on your local network is a device that's <em>also</em> connected to <em>another</em> network.  That other network isn't "the Internet"; it's a somewhat larger network, but still pretty small.  Maybe there's one such network for your entire school.  The <strong>routers</strong> are the machines that are connected to two or more networks, your local one and some wider area ones.  It's a "router" because its job is to route incoming messages to the particular local computer to which each message is addressed.  It also knows how to forward outgoing messages to the best available larger network.</p>

                    <p>So, does your message finally get onto a super-huge network called "the Internet"?  No; all of the networks together, even the local net in your house, make up the Internet.  It's called "<strong>Internet</strong>" because it's a <em>network of networks</em>.</p>
                    <p>The network hardware interface attached to your computer only knows how to send messages to other computers on your local network.  When you ask for a web site on the other side of the world, as far as the hardware is concerned, you're just sending your request to your local router.  The router has to forward your message to <em>its</em> router, and so on, until you reach a router that's on <em>several</em> large networks and has to figure out which one is best for the next step in getting your request to its final destination.  The rules by which routers know how to do that are the <strong>Internet Protocol.</strong>  It's the abstraction that lets you imagine you're on a single huge network with all of the other computers in the world.</p>
