        <h2>Who's In Charge of the Internet?</h2>
        <div class="todo">This page is ready for review. No one has reviewed it. --MF</div>

        <div class="todo">
        	From BH:
            <ul>
            	<li>4.5.1  The last two paragraphs are vital.<ul><li>These? I created a section with this called "The Issue of US Control." --MF <p>Other countries have never been happy about the US control of the Internet.  For example, until 2009 all DNS domain names had to use the English alphabet, despite constant requests to accommodate other languages. 2009 was also the year of a large international meeting whose goal was to internationalize Internet governance, but the US didn't cooperate.</p>
				<p>The issue of US control has become much more heated since Edward Snowden's exposure of very extensive spying on Internet traffic by the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013. It's too soon to know how these concerns will eventually be resolved.</p></li></ul></li>
				<li>I don't know why the framework talks about IETF but not about ICANN, which is just as important.  There's also W3C if we want to be complete.<ul><li>I commented this out for now. --MF</li></ul></li>

            	<li>Read <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=330" target="_blank"><em>Blown to Bits</em> pages 312-316</a>.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>Interfaces and protocols enable widespread use of the Internet. But who's in charge?</p>
        <div class="sidenote"><strong>ISP</strong> stands for Internet Service Provider.</div>
		<img class="imageLeft" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/take-turns-speaking-mini.gif" alt="Take turns speaking" title="Take turns speaking">
        <p>The computers on the Internet and the connections among them don't belong to any one organization. Different ISPs serve the Internet to different communities. And typically within a large organization, the Internet connections are provided by the organization itself. </p>
		
        <p><strong>So who's in charge of the whole network of networks?</strong></p>        
        <p>Some people think that nobody's in charge&mdash;that everyone just cooperates freely with no central organization. It's true that free cooperation plays an important role, but people can't just pick any IP address or host name they want or else there would be conflicts. </p>
        <div class="endnote">For example, we can't start a server named bjc.org, because that name is already in use (by a health care provider in St. Louis, Missouri).</div>
        <p>So, the simplest answer (but a somewhat misleading one) is that <strong>the US government is in charge because it has authority over the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-web-data/1-internet.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment#DNS">DNS hierarchy</a></strong> from its role in the development of the Internet.</p>
        
        
		<h3>The Power of Open Protocols</h3>
        <p>The Internet is a <em>packet-switched system</em> through which digital data is sent by breaking the data into packets that contain both the data being transmitted and address routing the data. Protocols (i.e. standards) control the routing, reliability, and interpretation of the data.</p>
        <p>The growth of the Internet has been fueled by <strong>open protocols</strong>, standards that are <em>not owned by a company</em>.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
        	Examples of open protocols:
              <ul>
                <li>Standards for <em>sharing information</em> and <em>communicating between browsers and servers</em> on the Web include <strong>HTTP</strong>, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (<strong>SMTP</strong>) and secure sockets layer/transport layer security (<strong>SSL</strong>/<strong>TLS</strong>)</li>
                <li>Standards for <em>packets and routing</em> include transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (<strong>TCP</strong>/<strong>IP</strong>).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The <strong>Internet Engineering Task Force</strong> (IETF) are the <em>experts</em> in charge of developing and approving these protocols. The work of the IETF is done largely by email, and anyone with the necessary expertise can join the mailing lists. Decisions are made by consensus (everyone has to agree to a change), never by voting. The idea is that if a proposal is controversial enough to need a vote, then it should be improved until everyone's objections are satisfied.</p>
        <!--<div class="forYouToDo">
            <p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is the central authority for IP addresses and for top-level domains such as <em>com</em> and <em>edu</em>. ICANN directly manages the root zone of the DNS, but contracts out the management of individual domains to other organizations, usually businesses for the general domains, and of course governments for the two-letter country code domains (although those governments in turn often contract out the management of their domains to businesses).</p>
            <p>Allocation of IP addresses, another ICANN responsibility, has been contracted out to five Regional Internet Registries, roughly one per continent. The one for North America is the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN). The regional registries allocate blocks of addresses to Internet Service Providers.</p>
        </div>-->
        <p>The Internet Society (ISOC) is a worldwide nonprofit membership society that <em>anyone</em> can join, for free. It is now officially in charge of IETF, and also conducts education and promotes government policies supporting an open Internet.</p>
		<div class="todo">Brian, please check the following sentence and then remove this comment. --MF</div>
        <div class="takeNote">So, <em>the IETF and the ISOC</em> (which you could join) that oversees the IETF <em>oversee the protocols</em>, but the <em>US Department of Commerce  controls the DNS hierarchy</em> (domain namespace and the of allocation of IP addresses).</div>


    <h3>The Issue of US Control</h3>
    	<div class="sidenote"><img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/snowden.png" alt="Edward Snowden" title="Edward Snowden" /><br />Edward Snowden<br />Source: Wikipedia</div>
        <p>If you think it's strange for one country to control a worldwide network, you're not alone. Other countries have never been happy about the US control of the Internet.</p>
        <div class="endnote">For example, until 2009 all DNS domain names had to use the English alphabet, despite constant requests to accommodate other languages. Also in 2009, there was a large international meeting whose goal was to internationalize Internet governance, but the US didn't cooperate.</div>
        <p>The issue of US control has become much more heated since 2013 when Edward Snowden exposed the US National Security Agency (NSA) for spying on Internet traffic. It's too soon to know how these concerns will eventually be resolved.</p>
        <div class="ifTime" id="first">
        	<div class="endnote">
                <p><strong>How did the US end up in charge?</strong></p>
        		<p>In 1968, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the US Department of Defense announced that they were developing a large-scale packet-switched network. In 1969, the first connections were made among four university research groups. At its peak, the ARPANET reached a few hundred computers. (All those computers were owned either by military installations or by computer science research labs, mostly at universities.) </p>
            	<p>The ARPANET was tiny, but it inspired the protocols that became foundation of the Internet. And it belonged to the US military.</p>
                <p>Once IP was invented in 1982, the ARPANET became just one network among many, and it was decommissioned in 1990. And in 1981, the National Science Foundation (NSF, a civilian agency of the US government that also funded the development of this curriculum) had built the core of a new cross-country network. At that time, businesses still weren't allowed on the network, but there was a clear demand. So, commercial IP-based networks were created.</p>
                <p><strong>From Research to Commerce</strong></p>
                <p>During all this time, the assignment of IP addresses and host names was <em>controlled first by the ARPA and later by NSF</em>. But when the commercial use of the Internet became larger than the research use, <em>that control was passed to the US Department of Commerce</em>, which is still officially in control of the root of the domain namespace and of allocation of IP addresses.</p>
                <p>But in practice, the Department of Commerce doesn't run the Internet directly. Instead, they hire a number of different organizations, some for profit and others nonprofit. And only very rarely has the US government actually overruled these organizations.</p>
                <p>In 2009, the Department of Commerce signed an agreement making the Internet governing bodies more independent, although they do still have some contracts with the US.</p>
