        	Here are the EKs I expect will be covered on this page. Please mark with <em>italics</em> those that have definitely been covered and mark with <strong>bold</strong> those that will definitely not be covered here. Thanks, Mary
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EK6.3.1H</strong> Cryptography is essential to many models of cybersecurity.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.3.1I</strong> Cryptography has a mathematical foundation.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.3.1J</strong> Open standards help ensure cryptography is secure.</li>

	<p>  You've seen some methods for coding messages before [????], and you looked a bit at some ideas about security and public key [???].  You'll now look at a general method for coding messages that shows how it's possible to let everyone know what your coding process is while still making the decoding process very difficult to figure out.   </p>
