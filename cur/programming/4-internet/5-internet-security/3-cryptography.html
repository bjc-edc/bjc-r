                	<em>Symmetric</em> cryptography, uses the <em>same secret key to encode and decrypt</em> a message. Symmetric cryptography has been around for thousands of years. The trouble with symmetric cryptography is: <em>how can we keep the key secret?</em> 
                	<div class="endnote">Long before computers, a rider on horseback could swallow the key to a message if they were captured. Now, messages are sent over a public Internet; so symmetric cryptography won't work.<div class="todo">Is this all right, Brian? --MF</div></div>
                </p>
				<p>
                	<em>Public key (asymmetric)</em> cryptography was created by mathematicians in the 1970s.  It uses <em>two different keys for encryption and decryption</em>, and knowing the encryption key doesn't let you figure out the decryption key.
                    <div class="endnote">For example, bank each have a public key, and when users enter their password on the bank web site, the user's browser encrypts the password with the bank's key before sending it over the Internet. Then, only the bank can decrypt that message.</div>

					<div class="commentBig">This video is very nice and suggests a demo that teachers might want to do in class.  But, the more I think about it, the more I think it complcates the basic idea.  You don't need two separate keys to *send* a secure message.  Also, the modular arithmetic suffesrs from the same problem, and I think it's both too much and too little for the kids. --AC</div>

			<p>The security of the system lies in key being a difficult function to invert.</p>
			<p>
            	<strong>Sending a secure message to Alice:</strong>
				<ol type="A">
                    <li>If Alice has function (let's call it <span class="katex">f</span>) that is difficult to invert (undo), then she can post the function for everyone to see because only she knows the inverse, <span class="katex">f^{-1}</span>.</li>
                    <li>If Bob wants to send Alice a secure message <span class="katex">M</span>, he can run his message though Alice's one-way function and post this for all the world to see.(In function notation, he posts <span class="katex">f(M)</span>. </li>
                    <li>Only Alice can decode it using <span class="katex">f^{-1}</span>. She calculates <span class="katex">f^{-1}\left(f(M)\right)</span>.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
            <p>To send secure messages back and forth, both Bob and Alice will need to post their public keys (and keep their inverse functions, their private keys, to themselves for decoding).</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="2">
                <li>Load this project: <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/4-internet/U4L5-EncodeDecode.xml">U4L5-EncodeDecode.xml</a></li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="todo">The original way one constructed the function  <span class="katex">f</span>  was to use something like <span class="katex">x\mapsto x^e \mod  N</span>  Where <span class="katex">N</span> is a product of 2 huge primes <span class="katex">p</span> and <span class="katex">q</span> and <span class="katex">e</span> is relatively prime to <span class="katex">(p-1)(q-1)</span>. The public key is then the pair <span class="katex">(N,e)</span> and the secret key is the number <span class="katex">d</span> so that <span class="katex">ed \equiv 1  (p-1)(q-1)</span>.</div>
        
        <p> The use of both private keys comes in when you want to have an electronic signature to add even more security.   Then Bob first encrypts his message to Alice with his private key, then Alice's public key.  Alice gets the message and decrypts it by applying her private key and then Bob's public key.  All this is a nice application of function composition and how to apply functions in certain sequences.</p>
        
		<p>It's also possible to use the private key for encryption and the public key for decryption.  That's no good for secret messages (why not?), but it's useful for /digital signatures/.  I use my private key to encrypt a message; you use my public key to decrypt it.  If you get a meaningful message as the result, that proves that the message was encrypted with my private key.  (If you want both secrecy and digital signing, there's a protocol for that too, involving several layers of re-encrypting already-encrypted messages.)</p>
		<p>Public key cryptography doesn't solve all the problems, because you might publish a fake public key pretending to be mine.  In practice this is partly fixed by relying on trusted third parties, called Certificate Authorities, to issue public keys.  But that just pushes the problem further back; someone could pretend to be a Certificate Authority!</p>

	<p>  You've seen some methods for coding messages before [????], and you looked a bit at some ideas about security and public key [???].  You'll now look at a general method for coding messages that shows how it's possible to let everyone know what your coding process is while still making the decoding process very difficult to figure out.   </p>
