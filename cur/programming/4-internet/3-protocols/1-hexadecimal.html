		<h2>Hexadecimal Representation</h2>
        <div class="todo">From BH: And this is where your explanation of hex belongs -- it should show a binary number with the powers of 2 (as 2^k, not computed) above the bits, and with the ones where the exponent is a multiple of 4 in red or something.  And then you can say that binary numbers are way too long to read, so people abbreviate them by taking advantage of the fact that 2^4=16, so each set of four bits (counting from the right, because the leftmost one might be a partial nybble) is one hex digit.  Sometimes you'll see octal used, too, where each digit represents three bits.</div>

        <p>Because humans have 10 fingers, the number system you learned in school is decimal (or base 10). Place value lets us re-use those few digits for zillions of numbers, depending on where the digits are placed. Each place is worth 10 times the place to its right. So an 8 in the ones place (10<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1) is worth just <em>eight</em>, an eight in the tens place (10<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10) is worth <em>eighty</em>; in the hundreds place (10<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;100), an 8 would be worth <em>eight-hundred</em>; an 8 in the thousands place (10<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1000) is worth <em>eight-thousand</em>, and so on. </p>
        <div class="endnote">
          <p>Our way of <em>saying</em> numbers, like our way of <em>writing</em> numbers, is mostly  based on ten, too, as you can see in the number words above. But not completely! Many languages, including English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, Danish, German, Russian, Greek, Farsi, Hindi and many more, were <em>originally</em> based on 20. The French word for 87 is <em>quatre-vingt sept</em>, which, in English, would translate to "four twenties (and) seven." And when President Lincoln addressed the people at Gettysburg, he began with &quot;Fourscore and seven years ago,&quot; meaning &quot;87 years ago&quot;—a <em>score</em> was twenty. English and those other languages still have many hints of the original base 20, but are now mostly based on 10.  <a href="http://www.sf.airnet.ne.jp/ts/language/number/tzotzil.html" target="_blank">Tzotzil</a>, a language of the Mayan in Mexico, uses base 20 completely. And there are other systems, too. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwandara_language" target="_blank">Nimbia dialect of the Gwandara language</a> in Nigeria uses base 12 for its number words, just as 12 became the base for time (twelve hours, twelve months) and five times twelve became the basis for time (sixty seconds, sixty minutes) and angle (6 times 60 degrees).</p></div>
<p>As you learned in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/5-block-types-calculations/3-binary.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 1</a>, computers transmit information in base 2 (ones and zeros together with a ones place, a twos place, a fours place, an eights place, and so on). Because binary numerals have so few digits to choose from, they are often long, so we abbreviate them using base 16, or hexadecimal (a.k.a. hex).</p>
        <p>Hex is used for representing colors (as you saw in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-web-data/2-writing-html.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment#hex">Lab 1</a>) and in the new form of representing IP addresses (as you will see on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-protocols/2-ip-routing.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">the next page</a>).</p>
        

        <h3>Review of Decimal and Binary</h3>
<div class="comment">Examples shouldn't introduce spurious pattern that can be seen as <em>part</em> of what is being exemplified.  123 is not  "random," especially because the topic is the use of digits. 481 is more generic looking (and still works for hex).</div>
        <p><strong>Decimal</strong> representation uses the ten familiar digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). Their place in the numeral multiplies their value by the appropriate <strong>power of 10</strong>. For example,</p>
        <!--<p class="center"><span class="katex">12345 base 10 = 1 \cdot 10^4 + 2 \cdot 10^3 + 3 \cdot 10^2 + 4 \cdot 10^1 + 5 \cdot 10^0</span></p>-->
        <p class="center"><span class="katex">481_\text{ base 10} </span></p>
        <p class="center"><em><strong>means</strong></em></p>
        <p class="center"><span class="katex">(4 \cdot 10^2) + (8 \cdot 10^1) + (1 \cdot 10^0) </span> <em>(all computations are written in base 10)</em></p>
<!--<p class="center"><span class="katex">= 1 \cdot 100 + 2 \cdot 10 + 3 \cdot 1 \text{ base } 10</span></p>-->
        <p class="center"><span class="katex">= 400 + 80 + 1</span></p>

        <p><strong>Binary</strong> representation uses only  two digits, 0 and 1. Their place in the numeral multiplies their value by <strong>a power of 2</strong>. For example,</p>
        <!--<p class="center"><span class="katex">11000000111001 \text{ base } 2 = 1 \cdot 2^{13} + 1 \cdot 2^{12} + 0 \cdot 2^{11} + 0 \cdot 2^{10} + 0 \cdot 2^9 + 0 \cdot 2^8 + 0 \cdot 2^7 + 0 \cdot 2^6 + 1 \cdot 2^5 + 1 \cdot 2^4 + 1 \cdot 2^3 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0</span> = XXX base 10</p>-->
        <p class="center"><span class="katex">111100001_\text{ base 2}</span></p>
        <p class="center"><em><strong>means</strong></em></p>
    	<p class="center"><span class="katex"> (1 \cdot 2^8) + (1 \cdot 2^7) + (1 \cdot 2^6) + (1 \cdot 2^5) + (0 \cdot 2^4) + (0 \cdot 2^3) + (0 \cdot 2^2) + (0 \cdot 2^1) + (1 \cdot 2^0) </span> <em>(again, all computations written base 10)</em></p>
        <!--<p class="center"><span class="katex">= 1 \cdot 64 + 1 \cdot 32 + 1 \cdot 16 + 1 \cdot 8 + 0 \cdot 4 + 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 1 \text{ base } 10</span></p>-->
        <p class="center"><span class="katex">= 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 1 = 481_\text{ base 10}</span></p>
<p>So <span class="katex">111100001_\text{ base 2}</span> and <span class="katex">481_\text{ base 10} </span> are two ways of writing the same number. </p>
        
<div class="endnote">
			Information in computers is generally stored in "bytes" that are 8 or 16 (or more) bits long.  So even though the binary numeral <span class="katex">1001_\text{ base 2}</span> requires only four bits, it might be stored as the 8-bit  byte <span class="katex">00001001</span>.
<!-- 
            <p>Since base 10 has more possible digits than base 2, the numerals are shorter. So,</p>
            <p class="center">1&nbsp;base&nbsp;10&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;base&nbsp;2</p>
            <p class="center">2&nbsp;base&nbsp;10&nbsp;=&nbsp;10&nbsp;base&nbsp;2</p>
            <p class="center">3&nbsp;base&nbsp;10&nbsp;=&nbsp;11&nbsp;base&nbsp;2</p>
            <p class="center">4&nbsp;base&nbsp;10&nbsp;=&nbsp;100&nbsp;base&nbsp;2</p>
            <p class="center">5&nbsp;base&nbsp;10&nbsp;=&nbsp;101&nbsp;base&nbsp;2</p>
            <p class="center">and so on...</p>  -->

        <h3>Hexadecimal (&quot;hex notation&quot;)</h3>
        <p><strong>Hexadecimal</strong> representation uses sixteen digits, our familiar ten (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) and the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F for the remaining six. Their place  in a numeral multiplies their value by a <strong>power of 16</strong>. For example,</p>
        <p class="center"><span class="katex">1\text{E}1_\text{ base 16} </span></p>
        <p class="center"><em><strong>means</strong></em></p>
<p class="center"><span class="katex">(1 \cdot 16^2) + (14 \cdot 16^10) + (1 \cdot 16^0) </span></p>
        <p class="center"><span class="katex">= (1 \cdot 256) + (14 \cdot 16) + 1 \cdot 1</span></p>
        <p class="center"><span class="katex">= 256 + 224 + 1</span></p>
        <p class="center"><span class="katex">= 481_\text{ base 10} </span></p>
        
        <div class="endnote">
            In base 16, the letters A through F are used as the extra digits. So,

            <p class="center"><span class="katex">9_\text{ base 16} = 9_\text{ base 10}</span></p>

(Does this shift emphasis to the wrong level skill?) And, finally, are there other costs? (Maybe not on these; I haven't tried. But the Cisco binary had high anxiety cost.

        <h3>Hexadecimal Colors</h3>
		<p>Computers have several ways of representing colors, depending on whether they are intended for controlling three-color (red, green, blue) screen display, four-color (cyan, yellow, magenta, black) printing, or other purposes. On a computer screen, each <strong>pixel</strong>—each dot that makes up the picture on the screen—is assigned an RGB color defined by the intensity of Red, Green, and Blue in that color. The intensities can range from 0 to 255 (decimal notation), which is 0 to FF (hex notation). If (R,G,B)=(0,0,0) the color is black: no red, no blue, no green. If <span style="color:#8000FF;"> (R,G,B)=(128,0,255), the color is purple: some red and a lot of blue, but no green at all.</span> If all three colors are as bright as possible (all are 255), we see white. Instead of writing (255,255,255) for white and (128,0,255) for purple, we often use hex notation: FFFFFF and 8000FF.
