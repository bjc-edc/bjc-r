        <h2>Writing HTML</h2>
        <!--<div class="todo">
        	<p>From PG: what I <em>really</em> think should happen is that students use an online two-view tool, code and image, and build a simple web page, perhaps for their school or interest or... With text and a graphic and (perhaps) a button or some other whizzy feature, and <em>then</em> look at some page we build (or some other) to see if they can find such features.  Or something. A low level part of the purpose of this page is to show what's under the hood of a web page (for which they don't need Snap), to show that they can see the source of a page (for which they don't need Snap), and to show that they can <em>get</em> that source with Snap so that they can process it for some purpose (like weather app, etc.).</p>
            <p>From Observation Notes Analysis: "The W3 HTML interface seemed to work very smoothly for students (though the instructions they were given didn't lead to interesting insights)." "Writing HTML: we need to clarify the basics of HTML more explicitly (like opening and closing tags and the difference between the head and the body—these are probably the most important). As I recall, a lot of what I'd originally included on this page was cut during revisions, but I think we need some of it back to help students get to some relevant insights (the most fundamental to using HTML in Snap!)." "Also need more very basics of HTML in TG." "Instead of using the w3schools example, we should have them copy/paste a View Source ["Weather App page (from weatherstreet.com)"] into that window. Then they can see both the HTML and the result together." "the WYSIWYG side on the right is like the Snap! stage." "[Some] made some cute additions (such as adding a background image to the page)." "U4L1: "Selective changes to HTML example tasks to help highlight essentials of HTML needed for importing into Snap!."</p>

        <div class="todo">2.2.3B High level programming languages provide more abstractions for the programmer and make it easier for people to read and write a program.<br />
        2.2.3C Code in a programming language is often translated into code in another (lowerlevel) language to be executed on a computer.<br />
        4.1.2A Languages for algorithms include natural language, pseudocode, and visual and textual programming languages.<br />
        4.1.2D Different languages are better suited for expressing different algorithms.

        <p>Unlike Snap<em>!</em>, which is a <em>general purpose</em> programming language, HTML is a <em>special purpose</em> programming language; it's designed for one specific task: designing web pages. HTML controls the layout and style of text and images on a webpage, but it doesn't allow for real programming like Snap<em>!</em> does. People use other languages like JavaScript to program algorithms into websites.</p>
        <p>Most web pages are written with <strong>HTML</strong> (<strong>hypertext markup language)</strong> and read with <strong>HTTP</strong> (<strong>hypertext transfer protocol)</strong>. The fundamental skeleton of every HTML webpage looks like the code below. Browsers use HTTP to turn the HTML into the site you see. Notice that most of the <strong>HTML tags</strong> (like <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>) have a closing tag (like <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>) designating the end, and the relevant content goes between the two tags. (The color and indentation improve readablity but are not necessary.)</p>
