    Specs:  In this project you will learn about simplified message encryption method based on the “Caesar Cipher” and use Snap! to implement it.  

Do It As A Class:  If you have not covered Unit 2 Lab 6 Encryption Page 2: Secret Keys, it will be beneficial to read that page first.  You may also want to look at the Snap! file linked here to get a feel what we are trying to build as you read the following pages.

Here is the Wikipedia entry for a “Caesar Cipher”:

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

In this project you will use a simplified version of the Caesar Cipher scheme where you will just will focus on the shifting of the alphabet.  You will not have to worry about the alphabet wrapping around back on itself, such as X, Y, and Z mapping back to the start of the alphabet to A, B, and C, as shown in the above example.  The Unicode key system employed by Snap! is vast so can safely assume that any set of text characters to be encrypted will map to a set of printable characters, which may include characters such as : ; < = > ? @ ^ * { } ~.  <br>

Unicode is the computer industry standard for encoding and numerical representation of text characters.  Access to the Unicode values in Snap! will be achieved by the following Operators blocks:<br>

Example:
Let’s say we are trying to encrypt “ABC123abc” with a Caesar Cipher.  Both the sender (encrypting/encoding agent) and the receiver (decrypting/decoding agent) of the message will agree ahead of time on a “Shift Value”.  Let’s say, this value is “4”.  Then all the characters are shifted 4 to the right in the encryption.
Thus “ABC123abc” when encrypted with a shift of 4 becomes “EFG567efg”.

A more complicated message such as:
“Invasion of Normandy is on 6 June 1944”
encrypted in a Caesar Cipher with a shift 4, becomes:
“Mrzewmsr$sj$Rsvqerh}$mw$sr$:$Nyri$5=88”
Do it with your Partner:
Try to encrypt and decrypt a simple message manually on your own using a Caesar Cipher to get a genuine feel for how this process works.  Use the Unicode table given above as needed.  Try to develop a simple algorithm for this procedure that works for any input text and given shift value.

Then try to code the simplified Caesar Cipher on your own in Snap! using the algorithm you have developed.    If you get stuck, below are some hints on how to proceed.

Here are some possible steps in the implementation of the Caesar Cipher:
Create and initialize variables that will store the input text, shift value and the output text.<br>
