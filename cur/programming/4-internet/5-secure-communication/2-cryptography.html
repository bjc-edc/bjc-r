        <h2>Cryptography</h2>
        

    <p>Cryptography is the process of writing (encryption) and solving (decryption) codes. Just as TCP enables reliable transmission over an unreliable network, cryptography enables verifiable, secure transmission over an insecure network.</p>

            <p><em>Symmetric</em> cryptography, uses the <em>same secret key to encode and decrypt</em> a message. Symmetric cryptography has been around for thousands of years. The trouble with symmetric cryptography is: <em>how can we keep the key secret?</em></p> 
			<div class="endnote">Long before computers,  riders on horseback could swallow the key to a message if they were captured. Now, messages <em>and keys</em> are sent over the  Internet, so symmetric cryptography won't work.</div>
			<p><em>Public key (asymmetric)</em> cryptography was created by mathematicians in the 1970s.  It uses <em>two different keys for encryption and decryption</em>, and knowing the encryption key doesn't let you figure out the decryption key.</p>
			<div class="endnote">For example, banks each have a public key, and when users enter their password on the bank web site, the user's browser encrypts the password with the bank's key before sending it over the Internet. Then, only the bank can decrypt that message.</div>
    <p>When you make a secure HTTP connection (the URL starts "https://" and a lock icon appears in the browser's URL bar), the browser uses a protocol called Transport Layer Security (TLS) or an older version called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) based on public key cryptography. The site to which you're connecting sends its public key, and your browser uses it to encrypt whatever information you send (such as your password for that site).</div>
