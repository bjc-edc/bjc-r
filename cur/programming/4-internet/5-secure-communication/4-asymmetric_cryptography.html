    	<h2>Public Key Encryption</h2>
		
		<div class="endnote"> The the methods so far all have a basic weakness:  the encryption method or key needs to be kept secret.  But keeping the key private is almost as hard as keeping the message private.  In 1976 Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman devised an ingenious method (now known as RSA) that allows a person to announce publicly how anyone can encode a message to him  so that only he is able to decipher it. The information, which is given away to everybody, is called the <em>public key</em>. The information which is needed for deciphering (the <em>private key</em>) is known only by the person for whom the message is intended. If Bob wants to send Alice a secret message, he enciphers it with Alice's public key. Then no one else can decipher it, even knowing her public key. Only her private key can undo the encryption, and you <em>can't figure out</em> the private key from the public key.</div>

             <li>   It may seem incredible that Alice can make her encryption key public and still no one except her can decrypt her message.  The public key method relies on some mathematics and on some limitations on the speed of current computers.  Read "Secrecy Changes Forever" (<a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=196" target="_blank"><em>Blown to Bits</em> pages 178-181</a>) to understand some of how this works.

        <div class="ifTime">
        	<div class="endnote">It's also possible to use the private key for encryption and the public key for decryption.  That's no good for secret messages (why not?), but it's useful for <b><em>digital signatures</em></b>.  I use my private key to encrypt a message; you use my public key to decrypt it.  If you get a meaningful message as the result, that proves that the message was encrypted with my private key.  (If I want both secrecy and digital signing, I encrypt the message with my private key to sign it, then encrypt the encrypted result <em>again</em> with your public key to keep it secret. You decrypt it twice, first with your private key and then with my public key.) This is a nice example of <em>composition of functions:</em> the output from the first encryption is the input to the second encryption.</div>
