        <p>Now that you know that the average length differs,  build a simple classifier based on the number of words in a particular message.</p>

                    	Implement in <span class="snap">snap</span>, and use it to classify the messages in our data.  You can use a regular loop to call your classify on the second item in each row of the data, or you might use this <i>faster</i> method using <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="the keep block">:<br />
