Here's a link to load the XML: <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/4-internet/old/BJCx_Internet_APIs.xml">BJCx_Internet_APIs.xml</a></div>

        <p>The Internet is full of information that you can use in your programs.  </p>
        <div class="endnote">For example, you could code an <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/umbrella.png" alt="umbrella? predicate" title="umbrella? predicate" /> block that looks up the weather forecast for your location (based on your IP address) and tells you whether or not to carry an umbrella. Or you could build a <code>current temperature</code> block that reports the current temperature for the given location:<br /><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/current-temp-34.png" alt="current temperature in (New York) reporting 34" title="current temperature in (New York) reporting 34" /></div>

What does the <code>http</code> block is report?</li>
                <div class="endnote">
                    Be sure <em>not</em> to include the "http://" in the input slot. That's already included as part of the <code>http</code> block.<br />

                <li>Open <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">http://snap.berkeley.edu</a> for reference. Can you find any correspondences between the actual webpage and the code that the <code>http</code> block reports?<br /></li>

        <p>You probably saw the page <em>title</em> (the text up at the very top of the browser window) but not much else that looks familiar. Like most web pages, this one starts with a specification of the page format (things like the margin space to the left and right of the page text); the actual contents of the page is further inside it.</p>
        <p>
            There are two custom <code>substring</code> blocks included in this project that allow you to select subsections of a text string. (What we've been calling a &quot;text&quot; is also called a <strong>text string</strong> or just a <strong>string</strong>.) They each report only a portion of a string:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <code>substring starting with</code> block reports the part that <em>starts with</em> (and including) the text you enter in the input slot.
                  <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/substring-starting-with-reporting.png" alt="substring of (This is an example of the substring blocks.) starting with (example) reporting 'example of the substring blocks.'" title="substring of (This is an example of the substring blocks.) starting with (example) reporting 'example of the substring blocks.'" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>substring up to</code> block reports only the part <em>up to</em> (but <em>not</em> including) the text you enter in the input slot.
                  <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/substring-up-to-reporting.png" alt="substring of (This is an example of the substring blocks.) up to (example) reporting 'This is an '" title="substring of (This is an example of the substring blocks.) up to (example) reporting 'This is an '" />
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use these two blocks together to report a specific piece of text on the page.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/youget.png" alt="substring of (substring of (http:// (snap.berkeley.edu)) starting with(You get a)) up to (</section>)" title="substring of (substring of (http:// (snap.berkeley.edu)) starting with(You get a)) up to </section>" /><br />

                	Use the <code>substring starting with</code> and <code>substring up to</code> blocks to create a reporter that uses the output of <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/http-reporting.png" alt="http:// (snap.berkeley.edu)" title="http:// (snap.berkeley.edu)"> to create a <code>most recent version of Snap!</code> reporter.
