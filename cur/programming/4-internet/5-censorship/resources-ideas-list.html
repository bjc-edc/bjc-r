    	<h2>Rules of the Internet</h2>
        
        What rules should there be for what you can/can't do on the internet?
        
        <p>Rough Outline thoughts for this lab</p>
        	<p>Can start with rules in general (that way it's not so much about pronography) maybe bring in this article? <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/08/26/americans-views-on-mobile-etiquette/" target="_blank">Americans' Views on Mobile Etiquette (from Pew Research Center, 8/26/15)</a></p>
            <p>That's not really related, though (just interesting).</p>
            <p>Think of rules. What can you say? What can't you say? What should you be allowed to say, even if it's unpopular? Can you say harmful things?</p>
            <p>What systems are/should be in place to make sure that bad stuff isn't getting said? Who should be held responsible for the information that gets put online?</p>
            <p>Another interesting but unrelated article: <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/01/teens-technology-and-romantic-relationships/" target="_blank">Teens, Technology, and Romanic Relationships (from Pew Research Center, 10/1/15)</a></p>
            <p>Blown to Bits reading. Beginning - p. 229-234 - about DOPA and some initial issues about why there's no clear way to regulate on the internet</p>
            <p>Blown to Bits reading. End - p. 253-257 World stuff</p>
