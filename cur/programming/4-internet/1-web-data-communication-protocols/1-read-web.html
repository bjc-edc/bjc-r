          <ul>
              <li>Can we use a page with cleaner HTML than snap.berkeley.edu? Also, what if whatever page we use changes even a little and things no longer match up? Should we use a dummy page of our own designed for this lab? --MF
                  <ul>
                      <li>PG: yes, we should use our own page, and a <em>simple</em> one. The http block's report is ephemeral,  switching back and forth requires re-clicking the block, rechecking to see what the page says, and generally makes it almost impossible to see <em>anything</em> recognizable. As for looking at the text browser tab, can we assume everyone knows what they're looking for. &quot;Above the page&quot; is only a dim cue and we see only part of the text in that tab anyway.</li>
                      <li>PG: first problem is that kids have no idea what they <em>should</em> be expecting to find in a web page, or even that a web page uses a programming language to organize the elements (pictures and text) on the page and create the buttons that we click, <em>just as they've created buttons to click in Snap</em>.</li>
                      <li>PG: what I <em>really</em> think should happen is that students use an online two-view tool, code and image, and build a simple web page, perhaps for their school or interest or... With text and a graphic and (perhaps) a button or some other whizzy feature, and <em>then</em> look at some page we build (or some other) to see if they can find such features.  Or something. A low level part of the purpose of this page is to show what's under the hood of a web page (for which they don't need Snap), to show that they can see the source of a page (for which they don't need Snap), and to show that they can <em>get</em> that source with Snap so that they can process it for some purpose (like weather app, etc.).<ul><li>How's this one? <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_basic" target="_blank">W3 Schools TryIt Editor</a> --MF</li></ul></li>

            The output of the <code>http</code> block is the code that creates the page at the address in the input slot. This web page notation, with things of the form:<br />
            <center>&lt;tag&gt;A bunch of text&lt;/tag&gt;</center><br />
            is a <em>special purpose programming language</em> (it's designed for a specific task) called <strong>HTML</strong> (HyperText Markup Language).
        </p>
        
        <div class="comment">I know &lt;body&gt; is HTML code, but I think it's confusing to use the same formatting for HTML code as for Snap<em>!</em> code. --MF</div>
		<p>
        	Every web page has a <em>head</em> (that tells the browser how to format the page) and a <em>body</em> (that contains the actual information on the page). You'll see something more interesting if you skip over the head by looking for the text "&lt;body&gt;":<br />

        <p>You very likely got an empty result back.  This is because of a security feature that disallows one web site (such as the Snap<em>!</em> server) from sending a request to another site.  Fortunately for us, it's not a very bulletproof attempt at security...</p>

                      <p>We should say something about how <code>proxied http</code> works. I looked and I kinda get it, but I couldn't explain it. Here, I'll try anyway... --MF</p>
                      <p>PG: We <em>must</em> say something, because editing the block <em>doesn't</em> tell us how it works. It shows some magic thing we won't understand.</p>
                </div>
                    <p>The <code>proxied http</code> block uses a proxy server (crossorigin.me) to call the URL you enter. This bypasses (how?) the security of (Snap<em>!</em>? Your browser? Something... definitely something....) and accesses the code directly.</p>
