        <p>In this course, when we talk about the social implications of computing, most of the focus is on the risks and challenges of new technologies.  That's because you mostly know about the good implications: the ability to communicate with friends worldwide, the explosion in creative expression, information at your fingertips, and so on. The risks and challenges need attention, but we shouldn't completely neglect the benefits of computing, as it has inspired advances in a wide range of fields, including the arts, science, engineering, and communications.</p>

        <div class="todo"><h3>Computing Affects Everything</h3></div>
        <div class="comment">CRD-2.A.1 "creative expression" only, IOC-1.A.2, IOC-1.A.5 "arts" only</div>
        <p>One purpose of computing innovations is creative expression. Music synthesizers, for example, are electronic musical instruments that allow musicians to simulate the sound of dozens of different kinds of instrument without actually having or being able to play them. When synthesizers were first invented, some artists considered this cheating. The 1975 Queen album <em>A Night at the Opera,</em> the one with "Bohemian Rhapsody" on it, for example, had the words "No synthesizers!" featured in the liner notes. Today, of course, digital synthesizers (as well as more specialized computerized instruments such as drum machines) are commonplace in popular music. The new technology often changes people's expectations and expands the reach of <em>human</em> creativity.</p>
        <!--<p>As we write this in 2019, computer-generated graphics are now good enough to allow simulations of dead actors in a movie.  This new technology will make new kinds of storytelling possible, but it also raises both aesthetic and ethical concerns.</p>-->

        <div class="comment">CRD-2.A.1, IOC-1.A.5 "stem" only</div>
        <p>Every branch of science has been transformed by modern computers.  In biology, the central example is <em>DNA sequencing.</em>  DNA, the fundamental "blueprint" for all living organisms, consists of very long molecules; human DNA includes over <em>three billion</em> tiny building blocks.  Modern supercomputers make it possible for human researchers to perform computations to analyze these sequences.</p>

        <img class="imageRight" alt="protein before and after folding" title="protein before and after folding" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/protein-folding.png" caption="Wikipedia, public domain" />
        <div class="sidenote">Protein folding image by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Protein_folding.png" title="Wikipedia user DrKjaergaard">Wikipedia user DrKjaergaard</a></div>
        <p>Another important topic in biochemistry is <em>protein folding.</em>  When your body needs to produce a protein molecule, it "folds" another molecule into the right shape. Certain diseases are the result of proteins folding incorrectly, and researchers want to find the correct folding (the correct shape) for every protein. But trying every possibility requires enormous amounts of computer time. So, the <em>Folding@home</em> group at Stanford University asks people to download a protein folding program that will run on your computer or phone only when you're not doing something else with it. Working together, tens of thousands of computers are like a very large supercomputer, except that supercomputers are expensive, while putting your computer's idle time to work doesn't cost anything.</p>
        <p>Folding@home is just one of several <em>citizen science</em> projects.  The first one was the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, which uses volunteered computer time to search for large prime numbers, which are of importance in public key cryptography. Another early citizen science project, probably the most famous, is SETI@home, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, created by astronomers at the University of California, Berkeley.  This project searches the pictures produced by large telescopes for radio signals that could be produced by intelligent life on a faraway planet.  (SETI@home hasn't found any signs of intelligent aliens so far, although it has found candidate radio signals for further study.)</p>

                <p>All of these projects require nothing from their volunteers other than installing a program.  But after some Folding@home users declared that they could find protein folds faster than a computer could do it, biochemists at the University of Washington collaborated with computer scientists in the UW Center for Game Science to create a video game, Foldit, in which you get points for folding proteins correctly.  People carry out computations much more slowly than computers, but people can look at a picture, such as a picture of a protein, and take in the whole shape at once, instantly seeing possible folds.  Computers, so far, can't do that instant analysis of a picture as a whole.</p>
                <p>They didn't have to make Foldit a game; they could have just presented it as an opportunity to help science.  But turning it into a game sparks some people's competitive spirit and gets them to try harder and for a longer period of time than they might without the "gamification" of the task.</p>

	    <p>Another kind of crowdsourced collaboration involves money.  When a natural disaster leaves many people homeless, web sites such as <a href="http://gofundme.com" title="gofundme.com" target="_blank">gofundme.com</a> let large numbers of people contribute small amounts of money that add up to enough to make a difference.  The contributors don't expect anything back for their contributions.  Similarly, small businesses can post notices at <a href="http://kickstarter.com" title="kickstarter.com" target="_blank">kickstarter.com</a> encouraging supporters to buy a product before it exists; the developers use the money to pay the initial development and manufacturing costs, and then give the supporters their purchases.</p>

        <p>People make computing innovations, and they do it for some purpose.  But they don't always anticipate all the consequences. Here's an oversimplified chart of some implications of Facebook:</p>

        <p>Facebook started as a way for college students to find their friends (their in-person friends, initially) when they go away, for example to a different college. But it turned out also to be good for organizing group activities, such as political protests and disaster support; computing innovations often have unintended beneficial effects in other fields. Facebook's ability to make money could have been based on charging a fee for a Facebook account, but instead they chose to make the accounts free and to make money by using people's data to provide advertising targeted to that user's interests.  You learned about how Facebook collects personal data even without users knowledge in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/4-privacy/2-examining-privacy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 1 Lab 4 Page 2: Examining Privacy">Unit 1 Lab 4 Page 2: Examining Privacy</a>, and this information gathering was intentionally designed into Facebook.  But one thing Facebook <em>didn't</em> intend was the ability of political campaigns and foreign countries to post content <em>lying</em> about opposing candidates that spreads rapidly throughout the network.<p>


        <div class="comment">IOC-1.A.4</div>
    	<p>Notice that these impacts can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful. You might not like your personal data being collected and shared with other companies, but <!--One way in which the table above is oversimplified is that the categories "good" and "bad" are value judgments.  If everyone agreed about them, there wouldn't be any intended bad consequences.  -->violating people's privacy isn't bad for Mark Zuckerberg; on the contrary, it made him one of the richest people on Earth.  <!--Whenever you see the word "we" used in an argument, make sure you know who's included in "we" and who isn't.  If it's supposed to mean everyone in a society, or everyone in the world, the argument is probably dishonest.--></p>

	<div class="comment">IOC-1.A.1, IOC-1.E.5</div>
	<p>Of course, computing innovations are created by people, not by computers.  The worldwide nature of the Internet both <em>requires</em> and <em>enables</em> collaborative design.  Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing.</p>
	<p>The old stereotype of software development is one guy (always male, in the stereotype) in the basement, who has an idea and goes without sleep until the software is finished.  Like all stereotypes, this was never <em>quite</em> true, but it had some truth to it.  That style of development worked because when computers were expensive, the people who used them were mostly programmers, with expertise and values a lot like those of the guy in the basement.  So software that he liked to use would be popular with the other programmers, too.</p>

    <div class="comment">CRD-1.A.3, CRD-1.A.5, CRD-1.A.6</div>
	<p>No part of that picture holds true today.  Computers are so small and so inexpensive that nearly everyone has one, kept in their pocket.  It's also their camera and their telephone.  So, for a software project to be successful today,
	<ul>
	    <li>it must meet the needs of people at all levels of expertise;</li>
	    <li>it must meet the cultural expectations of users from every country, of every economic class, every race, every gender, and every other social division;</li>
	    <li>it must meet (or create) a <em>need</em> of all those people.</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="todo">
        CRD-2.A.2: An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation.
    </div>
    <div class="comment">CRD-2.A.2</div>
    Nobody has enough experience with enough cultures to design for all these expectations.  Instead, innovations are designed by a <em>team</em> that includes potential users, from a variety of cultures, ideally by choosing diverse technical experts (programmers, graphic artists, user interface experts, and others) who'll do the actual implementation and who clearly understand the purpose of the innovation.  In addition, modern innovators survey large numbers of users outside their team to double-check that everyone's expectations are satisfied.  (This is why you may see invitations from a company to "alpha test" a new program.  It's only partly to help catch out-and-out bugs; it also finds out early if some users are going to get angry about something the developers never considered.</p>

●       the development of algorithms that include bias<br />
    </div>
	<div class="comment">CRD-1.A.4, IOC-1.F.11(2)</div>
	<p>Another reason a variety of people on the design team is desirable is to help avoid <em>bias</em> in the innovation.  In some early testing of self-driving cars, it was found that they weren't good at detecting pedestrians who were people of color.  This wasn't deliberate, of course; the artificial intelligence program that detected pedestrians had been trained on a vast collection of photographs of people, in which all the people happened to be light-skinned.  Luckily this problem was discovered in early testing, before the self-driving cars were really sent out on the road.</p>

        IOC-1.B.3: Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses.<br />
        IOC-1.B.4: It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used.
    </div>
    <div class="comment">IOC-1.B.3, IOC-1.B.4 (three paragraphs)</div>
	<p>That stereotypical loner coding in the basement was energized by an unspoken belief that "progress" is always good.  When the invention of the steam engine started the Industrial Revolution, the social effect for the next hundred years or so were awful.  Some people had to work 18 hours every day, in terrible conditions.  They lived in poverty and died young.  But <em>in the long run,</em> for us today, the machinery of the Industrial Revolution gives us previously unimaginable technology at low cost.  Until quite recently, the people who built technology were able to ignore any bad effects by thinking that, just as in the Industrial Revolution, the problems would be only temporary.</p>
	<p>But there have been too many news stories about unemployment, about privacy violations, about bias, about terrible working conditions in factories in China, and other problems.  It's now an assumption in our culture that technologists are responsible for all the effects of what they build, good and bad.</p>
	<p>But even with the best of intentions, developers can't predict <em>all</em> the effects of their inventions.  That's why they need quick feedback from people on their team whose job it is to stay on top of the news about their products, to try to fix problems quickly.</p>
	<div class="todo">
        CRD-1.B.1: Online tools support collaboration by allowing programmers to share and provide feedback on ideas and documents.
    </div>
    <div class="comment">CRD-1.B.1 (next four paragraphs)</div>
	<p>How do computers and the Internet enable collaboration?  The way that's most taken for granted is the worldwide telephone system.  Telephones are older than computers, but the early telephone systems didn't have area codes, let alone country codes.  You could dial people in your town, but to call anyone else you had to ask an operator (a telephone company worker) to connect you by hand.  Today, connecting telephone calls is done by computer, and you can dial just about any telephone on Earth yourself.</p>
	<p>Computers are more visibly involved when you use virtual meeting software.  Skype, the best-known example, is free in the sense of not costing you money to use it (although not in the sense of giving you the right to see or modify the software).  But Skype's free service degrades significantly if more than two or three people are on the call.  Both Skype and other companies offer commercial virtual meeting software that can connect dozens of users with good quality.</p>
	<p>Besides talking with each other, developers can collaborate on <em>multi-author documents</em> using software that allows them to share the ownership of an online document.  The best-known such system is Google Docs; like Skype, it's free in the money sense but not in the sense of sharing the software that implements it.</p>
	<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/git.png" width="165">
	<!-- waiting to see if I get away with this before typing in alt text -->
	<p>Systems that allow several people to edit the same document at the same time have the problem that one person's edits may contradict another person's.  <em>Revision control systems,</em> of which the best-known is Git (free in both senses), support a more complicated but safer kind of collaboration:  Each person has a private copy of the shared document, and edits that copy.  When a collaborator is ready to share an edit with the rest of the team, the software <em>synchronizes</em> the local changes with the online, shared version.  If changes from two collaborators conflict, the software won't allow the synchronization until the conflicting text is resolved.  The software also remembers the complete history of who changed what when, so it's possible to undo a change even if other parts of the document have changed since then.  But succeeding with Git does require a certain level of expertise.</p>

	<p>Google was founded in 1998.  Wikipedia was founded in 2001.  You've grown up taking for granted that you can find out anything you want to know, whenever you want, but in historical terms that's quite a recent development.  Access to information isn't just for satisfying your curiosity about how to pronounce "quinoa."  Access to information is useful for many purposes, large and small.</p>
	<p>For example, let's say your doctor wants to prescribe a medicine for you, but you're already taking other medicines.  Some <em>combinations</em> of medicines can be very dangerous, so your doctor has to know whether the new one is safe in combination with the old ones.  How do doctors keep all the interactions straight?  There are somewhere between 1000 and 2000 individual chemical substances used as prescription medications.  But the same chemical may be sold under several brand names, and there are drugs that combine more than one active ingredient; in 1981 there were 12,000 such formulations available by prescription in the United States.  The number of medicines available without a prescription is comparable.  Doctors can't possibly remember the drug interactions for every pair of medicines.  Before search engines, doctors relied on the fact that <em>most</em> pairs of drugs are safe together and that the number of <em>widely used</em> drugs is much smaller than 1000.  But today your doctor already has all your medications listed on their computer system, and can automatically check a new one against that list.</p>
	<p>Specialized web sites take information that's theoretically available to the public, but hard to find and hard to understand, and make it available in a practical form.  <a href="../4-community/followthemoney.org">followthemoney.org</a> and <a href="../4-community/opensecrets.org">opensecrets.org</a> are two web sites that collect and summarize information about major contributors to political candidates' campaign funds.
