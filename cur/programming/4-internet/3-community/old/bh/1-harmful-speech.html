         <h3>The First Amendment</h3>
  <p>Here is the First Amendment to the US Constitution:</p>
  <div class="takeNote"><strong>Congress shall make no law</strong> respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or <strong>abridging the freedom of speech</strong>, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</div>
    <p>"No law," it says.  Do you agree? Should <em>any</em> speech be allowed?</p><h3>A Case Study</h3>
    <p>In 1964, a racist Ku Klux Klan leader named Clarence Brandenburg gave a speech at a KKK rally in Ohio in which he said “if our president, our Congress, our Supreme Court, continues to suppress the white, Caucasian race, it’s possible that there might have to be some revengeance [sic] taken.”  He specifically advocated violence against "n____" and "Jews."</p>
    <p>Brandenburg was arrested under an Ohio law that prohibited advocating violence.</p>
