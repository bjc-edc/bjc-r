                <li>Write down three examples of speech (including Internet speech) you consider harmful.</li>

            <h3 class="box-head">The First Amendment to the US Constitution</h3>
            <strong>Congress shall make no law</strong> respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or <strong>abridging the freedom of speech</strong>, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

                <li>Discuss: do you agree that <em>no</em> laws should restrict free speech? Should <em>any</em> speech be allowed?</li>
                <li>Does the United States permit the display of Nazi symbols? Find out online if you're not sure. Why or why not?</li>
                <li>Can it ever be right to censor an idea in one country but not in other countries? Discuss.</li>
                <li>Has the United States ever censored ideas? (The First Amendment doesn't allow that, but has it happened anyway?) Research this.</li>
                <li>The technology used to censor the Internet in China is largely provided by US companies. Is that legal (in the US)? Should it be?</li>
