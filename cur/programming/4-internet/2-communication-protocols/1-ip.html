        <h2>Addresses in a Network of Networks: IP</h2>

        	<strong>6.1</strong> The Internet is a network of autonomous systems.<br />
            <strong>6.1.1</strong> Explain the abstractions in the Internet and how the Internet functions. [P3] <em>Exclusion Statement (LO 6.1.1): Specific devices used to implement the abstractions in the Internet are beyond the scope of this course and the AP Exam.</em><br />
            6.1.1B An end to end architecture facilitates connecting new devices and networks on the Internet.<br />
            6.1.1C Devices and networks that make up the Internet are connected and communicate using addresses and protocols.<br />
            6.1.1E Connecting new devices to the Internet is enabled by assignment of an Internet protocol (IP) address.<br />
            6.1.1F The Internet is built on evolving standards, including those for addresses and names. <em>Exclusion StatementÂ (6.1.1F): Specific details of any particular standard for addresses are beyond the scope of this course and the AP Exam.</em><br />
            6.1.1H The number of devices that could use an IP address has grown so fast that a new protocol (IPv6) has been established to handle routing of many more devices.<br />

        <p>The Internet isn't just a network of computers. It's a <em>network of networks</em>. The connection points are called <strong>routers</strong>, networking devices that route traffic between subnetworks on the Internet. How do the routers know where to find the computer you want? Every device on the Internet <!--(including smart phones, routers, Internet-enabled appliances, etc.)--> has a unique <strong>Internet Protocol (IP) address</strong> (or more than one, if it's a router), like a postal or email address. The Internet Protocol specifies how a router handles a request for another IP address.</p>

                <li>Why does the graph of the Internet look like a tangle in the middle with fireworks on the outsides?</li>
				<li>Discuss how this shape is related to how people connect to the Internet (though an Internet Service Provider, etc.). Write out a brief description and/or explain it to someone else.</li>
                <li>Visit <a href="http://bot.whatismyipaddress.com/" target="_blank">http://bot.whatismyipaddress.com/</a> for your current IP address.</li>
                <div class="sidenoteBig">You can add any IP address to the end of that URL like this: <a href="http://ipinfo.io/72.229.28.185" target="_blank">http://ipinfo.io/72.229.28.185</a></div>
                <li>Visit <a href="http://ipinfo.io/" target="_blank">http://ipinfo.io/</a>. What information does that page give you?</li>

        <p>The amount of detailed information available from an IP address is pretty amazing (and a little scary), especially when you think about the ways that information can be used.</p>
		<div class="sidenote">Some of the information might have slight inaccuracies. IP addresses often give the location of an Internet service provider, usually from a nearby location.</div>

        <h3>IPv4</h3>
		<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/ipv4.png" width="325" alt="IPv4" title="IPv4" />
        <p>Each of the four numbers in a typical IP address today is an eight-bit <strong>byte</strong> with a value between 0 and 255 (see right). A 32-bit IPv4 (the &quot;v&quot; stands for &quot;version&quot;) address is big enough to support 2<sup>32</sup> computers. That's about four billion (4 &middot; 10<sup>9</sup>), but there are more than <em>seven</em> billion people on Earth, so there aren't enough IP addresses to go around.</p>
        <div class="endnote"><strong>Why does IPv4 support 2<sup>32</sup> computers?</strong> There are 32 bits in an IPv4 adddress (see right), and each bit can be one of two possible values (0 or 1). So, there are 2<sup>32</sup> possibilities with thirty-two bits.</div>
	
    
        <h3>IPv6</h3>
		<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/ipv6.png" width="325" height="50%" alt="IPv6" title="IPv6" />
        <p>The long-term solution is to increase the length of an IP address. The new IP addresses are 128 bits wide, which is enough to support 2<sup>128</sup> (about 10<sup>38</sup>) computers.</p>

				<div class="endnote">Most likely, the router in your home or school uses a protocol that allows all the computers on the local network (such as in one building) to share a single IP address on the Internet, which can be cheaper. The router that creates the local network gives each computer a <em>local address</em>. For example, although the outside world may think someone's computer has IP address 108.26.181.226, that computer itself might think its address is 192.168.1.11.</div>
                <li>Look up your current <em>local</em> IP address in your system preferences or settings. It's usually under network or internet settings and may be listed with the computer device supporting that connection (wifi, ethernet, wifi, bluetooth, etc.).</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="endnote">The 192.168 <em>domain</em> (the block of IP addresses that all start with 192.168) is reserved for <em>local</em> networks, but no computer on the Internet has an address in that range.  <!--So, the job of the router is not really as simple as the end-to-end abstraction would suggest. (The 10.0 domain is also used for local addresses.)--> Another such domain is 10.0.</div>
