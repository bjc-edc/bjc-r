        <h2>Internet Abstraction Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>There are billions of devices connected to the Internet, and hundreds of different <em>kinds</em> of devices: laptops, tablets, phones, refrigerators, handheld credit card readers that the waiter brings to your table at the restaurant, and so on.</p>
        <p>How do they all know how to talk to each other?  The Internet was designed with several levels of <em>abstraction</em>.  Here's an only slightly simplified picture:</p>
        <table  class="center" border="2" cellpadding="6" summary="hardware, Internet Protocol, Transmission Control Protocol, application protocols.">
            <caption class="center"><h4>Internet Abstraction Hierarchy</h4></caption>
            <tr>
                <td>Application Protocols (like HTTP)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Transport Protocols (like TCP)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Internet Protocols (like IPv4 and IPv6)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Network Interface Hardware (like WiFi) </td>
            </tr>
		</table>
                                    
        <p>These layers are least abstract at the bottom and most abstract at the top.</p>
        <div class="takeNote">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Application Layer Protocols</strong> are the ones that <em>give meaning to the bits sent</em> by the lower-level protocols. The client and server computers have to agree about what the bits mean, and application protocols offer this. 
                    <div class="endnote">Examples: You've learned about <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/optional-projects/writing-html.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">HTTP</a>, the HyperText Transfer Protocol used by Web browsers to interpret information from a web server. You may also encounter FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which is used for sending or uploading files. And you probably regularly use SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send email and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) to read your email.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Transport Layer Protocols</strong> provide the abstraction of a <em>message</em> to a particular program on another computer, built out of the <em>packets</em>
actually transmitted by IP (which knows about computers, but not about which program is awaiting a packet).
<div class="endnote">Examples: You've learned about <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/2-tcp.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">TCP</a> (Transmission Control Protocol), which simulates a reliable, long-term connection between application programs on the endpoint computers, but not all application-level protocols use TCP. Sometimes speed of delivery is more important than guaranteed correct delivery, and for that there's UDP (User Datagram Protocol), which is used, among other things, for real-time video streaming, in which a missed packet doesn't noticeably affect the viewer's experience of the video.</div>
<!-- It's not true that UDP is used for stock trading.  It's used by stock exchanges to broadcast the current prices of stocks, but actual trades have to be reliable and use TCP. -->
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Internet Layer Protocols</strong> <em>manage the pathways that the data packets travel</em> across networks.  These protocols implement the abstraction of one large network, even though the hardware reality is many tiny subnetworks.
                    <div class="endnote">Examples: You've learned about two versions of <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/1-ip.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">IP</a> (Inernet Protocol) addressing: IPv4 and IPv6. Also in this layer are protocols that routers use to talk to each other, for example, to detect and work around points of network congestion.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Network Interface Hardware</strong>: All Internet devices connect through some kind of <em>physical interface that uses a protocol</em> to connect to the local network. These local protocols are the least abstract because they deal directly with your particular hardware connection.
                    <div class="endnote">Examples: There might be an <em>Ethernet</em> cable in a socket on the side or back of the computer (looking like a telephone jack but wider). Or perhaps there is a <em>WiFi</em> antenna inside the case connecting to your network router box by radio.  Your cell phone uses a longer-range <em>cellular</em> connection to your phone carrier. Each of these kinds of network hardware has a different protocol for sending messages. This is called the "Link Layer."</div>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>Your network interface connects you to a small <strong>local network</strong>.  If your connection is by Ethernet (physical cable), the local network is all the machines that are cabled together, typically all in one or two rooms.  If the computers in your lab are permanently installed, the odds are they're on an Ethernet.  If you're on a laptop, your local network consists of all the machines with WiFi connections to the same router, also typically very near each other.</p>
        <p>Somewhere on your local network is a device that's <em>also</em> connected to <em>another</em> network.  That other network isn't "the Internet"; it's a somewhat larger network, but still pretty small.  Maybe there's one such network for your entire school.  The <strong>routers</strong> are the machines that are connected to two or more networks, your local one and some wider area ones.  It's a "router" because its job is to route incoming messages to the particular local computer to which each message is addressed.  It also knows how to forward outgoing messages to the best available larger network.</p>
		<p>So, does your message finally get onto a super-huge network called "the Internet"?  No; all of the networks together, even the local net in your house, make up the Internet.  It's called "<strong>Internet</strong>" because it's a <em>network of networks</em>.</p>
		<p>The network hardware interface attached to your computer only knows how to send messages to other computers on your local network.  When you ask for a web site on the other side of the world, as far as the hardware is concerned, you're just sending your request to your local router.  The router has to forward your message to <em>its</em> router, and so on, until you reach a router that's on <em>several</em> large networks and has to figure out which one is best for the next step in getting your request to its final destination.  The rules by which routers know how to do that are the <strong>Internet Protocol.</strong>  It's the abstraction that lets you imagine you're on a single huge network with all of the other computers in the world.</p>
