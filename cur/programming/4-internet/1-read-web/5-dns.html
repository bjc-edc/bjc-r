<h2>Names to Addresses: DNS</h2>
<p>Up to now, we've been talking about Internet messages in terms of IP addresses, which are numeric. But when you use the Internet, you don't type in IP addresses. you use <strong>domain names</strong> such as <code>snap.berkeley.edu</code>. Your router doesn't know anything about these names; how does your message get to the right place?</p>
<p>One of the application layer protocols is called the <strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong>. Its main job is to translate names to addresses. For example, looking up <code>snap.berkeley.edu</code> gives a result like this:
<pre>Non-authoritative answer:
snap.berkeley.edu       canonical name = apps.eecs.berkeley.edu.
apps.eecs.berkeley.edu  canonical name = rt-eecs.IST.berkeley.edu.
Name:   rt-eecs.IST.berkeley.edu
Address: 128.32.189.18</pre>
<p>You can look up host names at web sites such as <a href="http://ping.eu/nslookup/" target="new">http://ping.eu/nslookup/</a>.
<p>The &quot;
  Non-authoritative answer
&quot; means that the name server I used isn't the official   <code>berkeley.edu</code> one, but rather is one provided by my ISP that in turn asked other name servers. Most of the time, when you're looking for a computer with a fixed IP address, these answers are reliable despite the label.
<p>What this answer tells you is that <code>snap.berkeley.edu</code> isn't the &quot;real&quot; name of any computer. Rather, the central Berkeley campus name server translates that name to <em>another name,</em> which belongs to the EECS department.  The EECS name server in turn translates that name to yet another name, rt-eecs.IST.berkeley.edu, which belongs to the campus Information Systems and Technology service.  Why all this renaming?  There a quite a lot of <em><code>something.</code></em><code>berkeley.edu</code> site names, so the people who run rhe (authoritative) name server for the <code>berkeley.edu</code> domain have a policy that all such names must be sponsored by a department, and the department system administrators tell the campus ones how to translate the name.  Thus, the name <code>snap.berkeley.edu</code> is translated into 
<code>apps.eecs.berkeley.edu</code>, which is in the <code>eecs</code> subdomain and therefore served by the EECS department nameserver. Originally that was the end of the story, because EECS housed its own servers within the department, but recently they decided to contract with IST to host department servers; that's why the name is translated one more time into an IST host name. The use of host names rather than IP addresses is important not only for user convenience, but also to allow this sort of reconfiguration, so that the site name remains constant even if its IP address changes.
