<h2>Reading Web Pages</h2>    <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-read-web/http-block.xml">this project</a>.</li>
<li>Find the block 
  <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/http.png" alt="http:// block"> in the Sensing palette, drag it into the scripting area, and click on it.
  <ul><li>What do you think the block is reporting?</li></ul></li>
  <li>In another browser window, open the page <code>http://snap.berkeley.edu</code> for reference.</li></ol></div>
<p>The page starts with two pictures (the Snap<em>!</em> logo and a screenshot), then some text.  Do you see any of that in what the <code>http</code> block reported?</p>

<div class="forYouToDo"><ol start="4">
<li>Actually, there <em>is</em> something in what the block reports that you can see in the browser.  Look at the text in the tab <em>above</em> the page.  What does it say?  Can you find that text in what the <code>http</code> block reported?</li>
<li>Every web page has a <em>head</em> (telling the browser how to format the page in general) and a <em>body</em> with the actual information on the page.  Perhaps you'll see something more interesting if you skip over the head by looking for the text &quot; <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>&quot;:<br />

    Make a list of all the formatting commands you can figure out.  For example, why is the background right here purple?</li></ol></div>
<p>This web page notation, with things of the form
<center>
<code>&lt;tag&gt;A bunch of text&lt;/tag&gt;</code>
</center>
is a <em>special purpose programming language</em> (one that's designed for a specific task, unlike what people usually think of as programming languages) called HTML (HyperText Markup Language).

<li>If you're an experimenter at heart, you've probably already tried the <code>http</code> block with a URL other than snap.berkeley.edu.  If not, try it now.</li>
<li>You very likely got an empty result back.  This is because of a "seccurity" misfeature that disallows one web site (such as the Snap<em>!</em> server) from sending a request to another site.  Fortunately, it's not a very bulletproof attempt at security.  Find the 
  <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/proxied-http.png" alt="proxied http://"> block and try it with your favorite web site.  Then look inside the block (right-click and choose &quot;edit&quot;) to see how it works.</li></ol></div>
