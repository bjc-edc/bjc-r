        <h2>Reading the Web with Snap<em>!</em></h2>
        <div class="todo">I took a first pass at this, and make some light but not substantial changes. I do wonder if we might <strong>use a page with cleaner HTML than snap.berkeley.edu</strong>... --MF</div>
	
    <p>In this lab you're going to look behind the scenes at how the Web actually works.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/4-internet/http-block.xml">this project</a>.</li>
                <li><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Find the block <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/http.png" alt="http:// block"> in the Sensing palette, drag it into the scripting area, and click on it. What do you think the <code>http</code> block is reporting?</li>
                <li>
                	In another browser window, open the page <code>http://snap.berkeley.edu</code> for reference. The page starts with two pictures (the Snap<em>!</em> logo and a screenshot), then some text.<br />
					<img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/s-b-e.png" width="50%" alt="snap.berkeley.edu as seen in browser"><img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/s-b-e-reported.png" width="50%" alt="html text reported by http block">
                </li>
				<div class="todo">
                	This feels like a trick question. You sit and look through all this code you don't understand, but there isn't actually anything there to find. --MF<br />
                    <ul>
                        <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Do you see anything in the speech balloon (which shows just the beginning of what the <code>http</code> block reports) that you think corresponds to the actual page?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <li>It may not look like there is anything in the speech balloon that corresponds to the actual page, but look at the text in the broswer tab <em>above</em> the page.  What does it say? Can you find that text in what the <code>http</code> block reported?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="todo">Regarding the next paragraph, I know &lt;body&gt; is HTML code, but I think it's confusing to use the same formatting for HTML code as for Snap<em>!</em> code. --MF</div>
		<p>
        	Every web page has a <em>head</em> (that tells the browser how to format the page) and a <em>body</em> (that contains the actual information on the page). You'll see something more interesting if you skip over the head by looking for the text "&lt;body&gt;":<br />

          <ol start="5">
                <li>Find the two pictures and the beginning of the text that appear on the web page in this report from the <code>http</code> block.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
           
        <p>
            The output of the <code>http</code> block is the code that creates the page. This web page notation, with things of the form
            <center><code>&lt;tag&gt;A bunch of text&lt;/tag&gt;</code></center>
            is a <em>special purpose programming language</em> (it's designed for a specific task) called HTML (HyperText Markup Language).
        </p>
        
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">

                <li>Try the <code>http</code> block with a URL other than snap.berkeley.edu.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p> You very likely got an empty result back.  This is because of a security feature that disallows one web site (such as the Snap<em>!</em> server) from sending a request to another site.  Fortunately for us, it's not a very bulletproof attempt at security...</p>
