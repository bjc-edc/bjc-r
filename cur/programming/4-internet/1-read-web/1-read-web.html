        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>You've certainly used a browser to get information from the World Wide Web. In this lab you're going to look behind the scenes at how the Web actually works.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/4-internet/http-block.xml">this project</a>.</li>
                <li>
                    Find the block <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/http.png" alt="http:// block"> in the Sensing palette, drag it into the scripting area, and click on it.
                    <ul>
                        <li>What do you think the block is reporting?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In another browser window, open the page <code>http://snap.berkeley.edu</code> for reference.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>The page starts with two pictures (the Snap<em>!</em> logo and a screenshot), then some text.  Do you see anything in the speech balloon (which shows just the beginning of what the <code>http</code> block reports) that you think corresponds to the actual page?</p>
        
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/s-b-e.png" width="50%" alt="snap.berkeley.edu as seen in browser"><img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/s-b-e-reported.png" width="50%" alt="html text reported by http block">
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="4">
                <li>Actually, there <em>is</em> something in the speech balloon that you can see in the actual page.  Look at the text in the tab <em>above</em> the page.  What does it say?  Can you find that text in what the <code>http</code> block reported?</li>
                <li>
                	Every web page has a <em>head</em> (telling the browser how to format the page in general) and a <em>body</em> with the actual information on the page.  Perhaps you'll see something more interesting if you skip over the head by looking for the text "<code>&lt;body&gt;</code>":<br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/s-b-e-body.png" width="100%" alt="substring of (http: ...) starting with &lt;body&gt;"><br />
                    Find the two pictures and the beginning of the text in this reported value.

            This web page notation, with things of the form
            <center><code>&lt;tag&gt;A bunch of text&lt;/tag&gt;</code></center>
            is a <em>special purpose programming language</em> (one that's designed for a specific task, unlike what people usually think of as programming languages) called HTML (HyperText Markup Language).

                <li>You very likely got an empty result back.  This is because of a "security" misfeature that disallows one web site (such as the Snap<em>!</em> server) from sending a request to another site.  Fortunately, it's not a very bulletproof attempt at security.  Find the 
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/proxied-http.png" alt="proxied http://"> block and try it with your favorite web site.  Then look inside the block (right-click and choose "edit") to see how it works.</li>
