        <h2>Open Protocols</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn about the communication standards used on the Internet and how they work together.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="vocabBig">
            <div class="todo">CSN-1.B.3, CSN-1.C.1</div>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>protocol</strong> is set of rules that specify the behavior of a system.</li>
                <li>An <strong>IP address</strong> is a unique number assigned to each device on a computer network.</li>
                <li>A <strong>packet</strong> is a small chunk of any kind of data (text, numbers, lists, etc) and metadata (information about the data) that is passed through the Internet as a data stream.</li>
                <li><strong>Packet switching</strong> means that the Internet sends short bursts of information, not long continuous strings.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>There are billions of devices connected to the Internet and hundreds of different kinds of devices: laptops, tablets, phones, smart refrigerators, handheld credit card readers, and so on. How do they all know how to find and talk to each other? <em>Protocols</em> (communication standards) ensure that the variety of devices interact with each other smoothly.</p>
        <p>Every device on the Internet has a unique <em>Internet Protocol (IP) address</em> (or more than one, if it's a router), like a postal or email address. The <em>Internet Protocol</em> specifies how a router handles a request for a different IP address. Each router knows the layout of its specific neighborhood of the Internet and knows which way to send each message to get it a little bit closer to where it's going. The fact that each router doesn't have to know the addresses of the complete Internet improves scalability.</p>
        <p>When you stream data over the Internet, the IP program in your computer divides the data into <em>packets</em> that it sends individually. This process is what makes the Internet a <em>packet switching</em> network.</p>
        <div class="comment">CSN-1.C.2, CSN-1.C.3</div>
        <p>The Internet is fairly reliable, but every once in a while a packet will be lost, and devices on the Internet need to tolerate these faults. One way to tolerate faults is not to care (if you lose one frame of video, it doesn't matter). Another way (called <em>TCP</em> for Transmission Control Protocol) is to keep sending packets until they are acknowledged as having been received correctly. Since packets can travel by different paths, they may arrive out of order; and despite the redundancy of the Internet, it's possible some won't arrive at all. TCP guarantees <em>reliable</em> data transmission by keeping track of which packets have been received successfully, resending any that have been lost or damaged, and specifying the order for reassembling the data on the other end. </p>

                <strong>TCP/IP</strong> is a pair of protocols that provide an abstraction: 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IP</strong> (Internet Protocol) lets your computer pretend it has a <em>direct</em> connection to another computer. The routers at every connection point on the Internet run the IP, which transmits packets from one IP address to another.</li>
                    <li><strong>TCP</strong> (Transmission Control Protocol) lets your computer pretend it has a <em>reliable</em> connection to the other computer. The computers (including servers) at the two endpoints of a communication run TCP, which guarantees data arrives successfully.</li>

        <h3>Internet Abstraction Hierarchy</h3>
        <div class="comment">CSN-1.D.2 (under "Application Layer Protocols")</div>
		<div class="sidenoteBig">
            <div class="todo">CSN-1.C-4</div>
            <h4>Example protocols for each layer:</h4>
            <p><strong>Application layer:</strong> Browsers use HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) to interpret HTML instructions for web page formatting. DNS (Domain Name System) converts user-friendly web addresses into IP addresses. Your email inbox may use SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) to read email.</p>
            <p><strong>Transport layer:</strong> TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) <em>simulates</em> a reliable, long-term connection between two computers by only displaying data once all packets have arrived. When speed is more important than accuracy, people use UDP (User Datagram Protocol), such as for real-time video streaming, where one missed packet doesn't matter much.</p>
            <p><strong>Internet layer :</strong> Every device on the Internet needs an IP address so other devices can find it. IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are upgrading from IPv4 to IPv6. Routers use Internet layer protocols to detect and work around network congestion.</p>
            <p><strong>Network interface hardware:</strong> You may connect to the Internet with an <em>Ethernet</em> cable or perhaps a <em>WiFi</em> radio antenna inside the case of your computer. Either connects computers to a local network router which then connects to an Internet service provider (ISP). Cell phones use a longer-range <em>cellular</em> connection to a phone carrier.</p>
        </div>
        <p>There are a <em>lot</em> of protocols! The Internet was designed with several layers of <em>abstraction</em> that sort the protocols according to what part of the process they support. This <em>hierarchy of abstractions</em> manages the complexity of the Internet by hiding the details of lower levels of the system. The highest level of abstraction includes the most general features of the Internet that have to work the same across all devices. At lowers levels of abstraction, things get more device-specific: </p>	
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Layer Protocols</strong> (such as HTTP) are the highest level of abstraction because they<em> manage how data is interpreted and displayed</em> to users. These protocols <em>give meaning to the bits</em> sent by lower-level protocols; user and server computers must agree on what the bits mean, and application protocols offer this.</li>
                <li><strong>Transport Layer Protocols</strong> (such as TCP) manage the <em>breakdown of a message into packets</em> to be transmitted by lower level protocols and also the  <em>reconstruction of the message from the packets</em> upon arrival.</li>
                <li><strong>Internet Layer Protocols</strong> (such as IP) <em>manage the pathways that the data packets travel</em> across networks. These protocols treat the Internet like one large network even though the physical reality on the lower level is one of many tiny subnetworks.</li>
                <li><strong>Network Interface Hardware</strong> (Link Layer Protocols such as WiFi): manage the connection between an Internet devices to the local network. These local protocols are the least abstract because they deal directly with your physical hardware.</li>
            </ul>
		</div>
        
        <div class="comment">CSN-1.B.4 (paragraph about "open standards")</div>
        <p>These are all <em>open standards</em>: anyone can look up a protocol and code with it to make new hardware or software without permission. The Internet is probably the largest and most complicated artifact in human history, and it relies on <em>cooperation</em>. Despite some governments' attempts to censor the net, the big picture is one of strong cooperative spirit.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Before the Internet, there were several different network protocols that were secrets belonging to particular manufacturers. So if you had a particular brand of computer or router, it could talk only to other computers of the same brand.</p>
