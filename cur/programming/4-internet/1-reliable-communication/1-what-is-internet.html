        <h2>What Is the Internet?</h2>		
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will learn the basics of how the Internet works.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will see how websites send you the files you request and learn some of the words used when discussing the Internet.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is a network of independent but connected devices all over the world. People talk as if "the Internet" and "the World Wide Web" are the same thing, but they are not. The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> is the collection of interlinked website <em>documents</em> (such as <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/optional-projects/writing-html.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Writing HTML">HTML</a> files) that you can view with a web browser by typing addresses like <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html" target="_blank" title="BJC Berkeley: Privacy">http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html</a>.</p>
        <div class="comment">IOC-1.B.1</div>
        <p>When Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web, he envisioned it as a way for scientists to exchange technical information.  But, as you know, it quickly grew to include business and personal communication of all kinds.</p>
        <p>Most web pages are written with HTML (hypertext markup language) and interpreted by your browser using HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol).</p>
		
	    <h3>What is a URL?</h3>
        <p>
            A <strong>URL</strong>, or <strong>Uniform Resource Locator</strong>, is an address for accessing specific web data located on a <strong>server</strong> (a computer hosting data for others to access). URLs can be broken into three parts:<br />
            <div class="sidenote">The <em>protocol</em> is not visible in the location bar of some browsers.</div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/URL-structure.jpg" alt="parts of a URL showing 'http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html' with 'http' marked as protocol, 'bjc.berkeley.edu' marked as domain name, and '/website/privacy.html' marked as path" title="parts of a URL showing 'http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html' with 'http' marked as protocol, 'bjc.berkeley.edu' marked as domain name, and '/website/privacy.html' marked as path" />
            <ul>
                <li><strong>protocol</strong>&mdash;the standard for communication between browsers and servers (usually "http" or "https")</li>
                <li><strong>domain name</strong>&mdash;the name of the server that hosts the data</li>
                <li><strong>path</strong>&mdash;the location of the data in a hierarchy of folders on the server </li>
                <div class="endnote">For example, the URL shown above tells a browser to use the <em>http</em> protocol to access the <em>bjc.berkeley.edu</em> server and then go to the <em>website</em> folder and open the <em>privacy.html</em> file.</div>
            </ul>

        <h3>How Does the Internet Work?</h3>
        <p>But the Internet is more general than the World Wide Web. It also supports email, file transfers, mobile apps, texting (a.k.a. SMS or Short Message Service), and many other ways that computers communicate behind the scenes.</p>
        <div class="vocabBig">
        	<p>A <strong>protocol</strong> is set of rules to standardize communication.</p>
            <p>A <strong>packet</strong> is a small chunk of any kind of data: text, numbers, lists, etc.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is a massive network of computers that facilitate communication around the globe. They do this primarily by using a pair of <strong>protocols</strong> (standards for communication) that you will learn more about in Lab 2:

			</ul>
		</p>
        
        <p>
			The algorithms that ensure data reach their destinations must continue to work even as the Internet grows. So, the Internet was designed to be

Even if one pathway is unavailable, there is still another way to transmit a message from sender to receiver (as shown right).</li>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-reliable-communication/4-address-hierarchy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Address Hierarchy"><strong>Hierarchical</strong></a>: There are two hierarchical Internet addressing systems, domain names (as shown below) and <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/1-ip.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Addresses in a Network of Networks: IP">IP addresses</a>. These address hierarchies work much like the postal system, which locates people first by state, then city, then street, then house number, then apartment, and then finally person.</li>
			</ul>
			The next two pages of this lab are about these two ideas.<br />
