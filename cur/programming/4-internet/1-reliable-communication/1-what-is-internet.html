        <h2>What Is the Internet?</h2>
        <div class="todo">Brian, I made non-trivial changes on this page that are all flagged for our discussion. --MF, 1/4/18</div>

            <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will learn the basics of how the Internet works.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will see how websites send you the files you request and learn some of the words used when discussing the Internet.</p>

            <strong>6.1</strong> The Internet is a network of autonomous systems.<br />
            <p>
                EK 6.1.1A The Internet connects devices and networks all over the world.<br />
                EK 6.1.1C Devices and networks that make up the Internet are connected and communicate using addresses and protocols.<br />

            <p>
                EK 6.2.2F The Internet is a packet-switched system through which digital data is sent by breaking the data into blocks of bits called packets, which contain both the data being transmitted and control information for routing the data.<br />
                EK 6.2.2G Standards for packets and routing include transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP).<br />
            </p>
            <p>
            	Brian and Mary TO ADD (6.2.2I may go on this page, see below, or on the next page with scalability; J &amp; K may require another page, or just use the commented-out video around line 75): <br />
				6.2.2I The size and speed of systems affect their use.<br />
                6.2.2J The bandwidth of a system is a measure of bit rate&mdash;the amount of data (measured in bits) that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.<br />
                6.2.2K The latency of a system is the time elapsed between the transmission and the receipt of a request.

                I think we should also touch on 7.1.1D here using content adapted from	<a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/new/cloud-computing.html" target="_blank">Cloud Computing</a>. That would require adding another 5-10 minutes to the pacing.  --MF, 1/4/18

        <div class="comment">Brian, this video and vocab box (it was orange before) was commented out further down on this page, but I brought it back to cover 6.2.2 J &amp; K. If there is something in the video that's not right, let's clarify that thing. If we agree to keep this, we need to adjust the pacing a bit (20-40 min). --MF, 1/4/18</div>

            <div class="comment">I made these complete sentences and added the word "connection" to "bit rate." --MF, 1/4/18</div>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>bit</strong> is a single unit of data that can only have one of two values (such as a 1 or 0).</li>
                <li>The <strong>bit rate</strong> of a connection is the amount of data (measured in bits) that can be sent in a specific amount of time.</li>
                <li><strong>Bandwidth</strong> is the transmission capacity of a system (measured by bit rate).</li>
                <li><strong>Latency</strong> is time between the transmission and the receipt of a message.</li>

		<p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is a network of independent but connected devices all over the world. People talk as if "the Internet" and "the World Wide Web" are the same thing, but they are not. The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> is the collection of interlinked website <em>documents</em> (such as <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/optional-projects/writing-html.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Writing HTML">HTML</a> files) that you can view with a web browser by typing addresses like <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html" target="_blank" title="BJC Berkeley: Privacy">http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Most web pages are written with HTML (hypertext markup language) and interpreted by your browser using HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol).</p>

        <div class="todo">Brian, I took the following out of its orange box and added two H3 headers (one here, which was an H4, and one below). --MF, 1/4/18</div>
		<h3>What is a URL?</h3>
        <p>
            A <strong>URL</strong>, or <strong>Uniform Resource Locator</strong>, is an address for accessing specific web data located on a <strong>server</strong> (a computer hosting data for others to access). URLs can be broken into three parts:<br />
            <div class="sidenote">The <em>protocol</em> is not visible in the location bar of some browsers (like Chrome).</div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/URL-structure.jpg" alt="parts of a URL showing 'http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html' with 'http' marked as protocol, 'bjc.berkeley.edu' marked as domain name, and '/website/privacy.html' marked as path" title="parts of a URL showing 'http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html' with 'http' marked as protocol, 'bjc.berkeley.edu' marked as domain name, and '/website/privacy.html' marked as path" />
            <ul>
                <li><strong>protocol</strong>&mdash;the standard for communication between browsers and servers (usually "http" or "https")</li>
                <li><strong>domain name</strong>&mdash;the name of the server that hosts the data</li>
                <li><strong>path</strong>&mdash;the location of the data in a hierarchy of folders on the server </li>
                <div class="endnote">For example, the URL shown above tells a browser to use the <em>http</em> protocol to access the <em>bjc.berkeley.edu</em> server and then go to the <em>website</em> folder and open the <em>privacy.html</em> file.</div>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>How Does the Internet Work?</h3>
        <div class="comment">Tuck in here: 6.2.2I The size and speed of systems affect their use.</div>
        <p>But the Internet is more general than the World Wide Web. It also supports email, file transfers, mobile apps, texting (a.k.a. SMS or Short Message Service), and many other ways that computers communicate behind the scenes.</p>
        <div class="vocabBig">
        	<p>A <strong>protocol</strong> is set of rules to standardize communication.</p>
            <p>A <strong>packet</strong> is a small junk of information. </p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is a massive network of computers that communicate, facilitating communication around the globe. They do this primarily by using a pair of <strong>protocols</strong> (standards for communication) that you will learn more about in another lab:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/1-ip.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Addresses in a Network of Networks: IP"><strong>IP</strong></a> (Internet Protocol), an addressing system that finds paths to distant computers</li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>
           The algorithms that ensure data reach their destinations must continue to work even as the Internet grows. So, the Internet was designed to be
			<ul>
				<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/redundant-2.jpg" alt="network redundancy" title="network redundancy" />
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-reliable-communication/2-network-redundancy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Network Redundancy"><strong>Redundant</strong></a>: There are multiple pathways among the physical connections of the Internet to create redundancy. Even if one pathway is unavailable, there is still another way to transmit a message from sender to receiver (as shown right).</li>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-reliable-communication/3-address-hierarchy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Address Hierarchy"><strong>Hierarchical</strong></a>: There are two hierarchical Internet addressing systems, domain names (as shown below) and <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/1-ip.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Addresses in a Network of Networks: IP">IP addresses</a>. These address hierarchies works much like the postal system, which locates people first by state, then city, then street, then house number, then apartment, and then finally person.</li>

            	The next two pages of this lab are about these two ideas.<br />
