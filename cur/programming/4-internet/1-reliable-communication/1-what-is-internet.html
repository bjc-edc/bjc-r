        <p>People talk as if "the Internet" and "the World Wide Web" are the same thing, but they are not. The <em>Internet</em> is a network of independent but connected computing devices spread out all over the world.  The <em>World Wide Web</em> is the collection of interlinked website documents that you can view with a web browser by typing an address like <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html" target="_blank" title="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html">https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html</a>. Most web pages are written with HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and interpreted by your browser using HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).</p>
        <p>The Internet is more general than the World Wide Web. It also supports email, mobile apps, texting (a.k.a. SMS or Short Message Service), file transfers, and many other ways that computers communicate.</p>

        <h3>How Does the Internet Work?</h3>
        <p>
            The Internet is a massive network of computers that facilitate communication around the globe. It works because it's engineered to be fault-tolerant (capable of working even if some of the network breaks down) and uses protocols (a type of abstraction) for routing and transmitting data:
            <ul>
                <li>The Internet is fault-tolerant because it is a <strong>redundant network</strong>. There are <em>multiple pathways</em> among its physical connections to create <em>redundancy</em>. Even if one pathway is unavailable, there is still another way to transmit a message from sender to receiver (as shown right).</li>
                <li>Data is transmitted via <strong>open protocols</strong>. Protocols <em>standardize</em> communication, so all data is sent by the same rules for sending and receiving the data. These protocols are <em>open</em> (available for use by anyone) to ensure that anyone can build systems that connect to the Internet.</li>
            </ul>
    	</p>
        <p>The Internet isn't just a network of computers, though. It's a <em>network of networks</em>. The connection points between networks are called <strong>routers</strong>, networking devices that route traffic between subnetworks on the Internet. Making sense of the information happens at the destination computer.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>router</strong> is a computer that passes information from one network to another.</li>
                <p>Your computer probably uses a router that is somewhere in your home to connect to your <em>ISP</em>.</p>
                <li><strong>ISPs</strong> (Internet Service Providers) are the companies who sell Internet access to homes and institutions.</li>
                <p>The computers connected to the Internet and the connections among them don't belong to any one organization. Different ISPs provide the Internet to different communities. And typically within a large organization (such as a university), the Internet connections are provided by the organization itself. </p>

        <h3>What Is the Cloud?</h3>
        <div class="vocabBig">

                <div class="commentBig">CSN-1.A.7, CSN-1.A.8</div>
                <li><strong>Bandwidth</strong> is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time (for digital data, it is measured in bits per second). Higher bandwidth is better because the data will travel more quickly.</li>
                <li>Storing data in <strong>the cloud</strong> means storing it <em>somewhere</em> on the Internet, but you don't know where. The cloud service provider (Google, Dropbox, Amazon,  Snap<em>!</em>, etc.) manages the actual storage location.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>In the early days of the Internet, <em>bandwidth</em> was slow, so people couldn't send video (only text and small pictures). Back then, computers were huge and expensive, so people went to a computer center to do their computations. As the technology became smaller and more efficient, however, these centers became less important because people could do computations on personal computing devices.</p>
        <p>More recently, though, certain kinds of computation (such as web searches and voice recognition) require more computational power, and these tasks are instead sent to huge "computer farms" where tens of thousands of computers work together on a problem. These computer farms, all together, are referred to as <em>the cloud</em>. You have been using the cloud throughout this course: all of your Snap<em>!</em> projects are stored in the cloud. You still use computer at your desk, but some of the programs actually run on the cloud.</p>
        
		<div class="endnote">When you save your Snap<em>!</em> projects to your account, they aren't stored on your local computer but on the cloud; that's why you have to log in to access them. Similarly, if you use Google Drive or Dropbox, all of those files are stored in the cloud. And if you use a web-based email service (such as Gmail or Yahoo), your emails are stored in the cloud too.</div>
