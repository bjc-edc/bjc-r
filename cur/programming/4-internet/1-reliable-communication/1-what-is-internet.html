		<p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is a network of independent but connected devices all over the world. People talk as if "the Internet" and "the World Wide Web" are the same thing, but they are not. The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> is the collection of interlinked website <em>documents</em> (such as <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/optional-projects/writing-html.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Writing HTML">HTML</a> files) that you can view with a web browser by typing addresses like <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html" target="_blank" title="BJC Berkeley: Privacy">http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Most web pages are written with HTML (hypertext markup language) and interpreted by your browser using HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol).</p>

	    <h3>What is a URL?</h3>
        <p>
            A <strong>URL</strong>, or <strong>Uniform Resource Locator</strong>, is an address for accessing specific web data located on a <strong>server</strong> (a computer hosting data for others to access). URLs can be broken into three parts:<br />
            <div class="sidenote">The <em>protocol</em> is not visible in the location bar of some browsers (like Chrome).</div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/URL-structure.jpg" alt="parts of a URL showing 'http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html' with 'http' marked as protocol, 'bjc.berkeley.edu' marked as domain name, and '/website/privacy.html' marked as path" title="parts of a URL showing 'http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html' with 'http' marked as protocol, 'bjc.berkeley.edu' marked as domain name, and '/website/privacy.html' marked as path" />
            <ul>
                <li><strong>protocol</strong>&mdash;the standard for communication between browsers and servers (usually "http" or "https")</li>
                <li><strong>domain name</strong>&mdash;the name of the server that hosts the data</li>
                <li><strong>path</strong>&mdash;the location of the data in a hierarchy of folders on the server </li>
                <div class="endnote">For example, the URL shown above tells a browser to use the <em>http</em> protocol to access the <em>bjc.berkeley.edu</em> server and then go to the <em>website</em> folder and open the <em>privacy.html</em> file.</div>

        <h3>How Does the Internet Work?</h3>
        <p>But the Internet is more general than the World Wide Web. It also supports email, file transfers, mobile apps, texting (a.k.a. SMS or Short Message Service), and many other ways that computers communicate behind the scenes.</p>
        <div class="vocabBig">
        	<p>A <strong>protocol</strong> is set of rules to standardize communication.</p>
            <p>A <strong>packet</strong> is a small chunk of any kind of data: text, numbers, lists, etc.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is a massive network of computers that facilitate communication around the globe. They do this primarily by using a pair of <strong>protocols</strong> (standards for communication) that you will learn more about in Lab 2:

			</ul>

Even if one pathway is unavailable, there is still another way to transmit a message from sender to receiver (as shown right).</li>

                <p>Think of a disk drive inside a computer.

That delay is the <em>latency</em>. But once the head is in the right place, the <em>bandwidth</em> of the disk is very fast.</p>

        <div class="comment">6.2.2I The size and speed of systems affect their use.</div>
        <p>The speed of a system (such as the bandwidth and latency of the Internet) affects how we use it. In the early days of the Internet, bandwidth was slow, so people couldn't send video (only text and small pictures). Streaming video requires higher bandwidth, but it can tolerate higher latency. If your Internet connection has high latency, then when you stream a video, your computer will buffer (download ahead of time) several seconds of video before it starts playing it so that it doesn't have to pause when it runs out of data.</p>
        <p>The size of a system also affects how it's used. In the early days of computing, computers were huge and expensive, so people went to the computer center at their local university or business to do their computations. As computers became smaller and more efficient, centralized computer centers became much less important because people could do computations on personal machines. More recently, however, certain kinds of computation (such as web searches and voice recognition) require more computational power, and these tasks are instead sent to huge computer "farms" run by companies such as Google and Amazon, where tens of thousands of computers work together on a problem. You still have a computer at your desk (or in your hand), but some of its programs actually run on a group of computers at one of these centralized farms.</p>
        <p>These computer farms, all together, are referred to as <em>the cloud</em>. You have been using the cloud throughout this course: all of your Snap<em>!</em> projects are stored in the cloud. </p>
		<div class="endnote">Your Snap<em>!</em> projects aren't stored on your local computer. That's why you have to log in to access your projects. Similarly, if you use Google Drive or Dropbox, all of those files are stored in the cloud. And if you use a web-based email service (such as Gmail or Yahoo), your emails are stored in the cloud.</div>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
        	<p>Storing data in <strong>the cloud</strong> means storing it <em>somewhere</em> on the Internet, but you don't know where. The cloud service provider (Google Drive, Dropbox, Snap<em>!</em>, etc.) manages the actual storage location.</p>

                EK 3.3.1A Digital data representations involve trade offs related to storage, security, and privacy concerns. <br />
                EK 3.3.1F Security and privacy concerns arise with data containing personal information.<br />
                EK 3.3.1G Data is stored in many formats depending on its characteristics (e.g., size and intended use)
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Data is stored in different formats depending its size and intended use. For example, external hard drives can be helpful for storing extra data that isn't accessed as frequently because they may not always be connected to the computer, and they may have a slower connection to the computer than the internal hard drive does (though it depends on the user's setup and the hard drive connection cables).</p>
        <p>Security is also a concern in data storage systems. If you lose your computer, you may have a password on it that will offer <em>a little</em> security for your data, but you might not think to put a password on a CD. Data can be <em>encrypted</em> as it is stored, but that can make the data take longer to access, and if you forget the decryption password, you can be locked out of your data.</p>
