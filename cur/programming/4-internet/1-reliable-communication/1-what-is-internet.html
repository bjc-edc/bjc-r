            <strong>6.1</strong> The Internet is a network of autonomous systems.<br />

            6.1.1A The Internet connects devices and networks all over the world.<br />
            6.1.1C Devices and networks that make up the Internet are connected and communicate using addresses and protocols.<br />

		<p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is a network of independent but connected devices all over the world. People talk as if "the Internet" and "the World Wide Web" are the same thing, but they are not. The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> is the collection of interlinked website <em>documents</em> (such as <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/optional-projects/writing-html.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">HTML</a> files) that you can view with a web browser by typing addresses like <a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Most web pages are written with HTML (hypertext markup language) and interpreted by your browser using HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol).</p>

            <h4>What is a URL?</h4>
            A <strong>URL</strong>, or <strong>Uniform Resource Locator</strong>, is an address for accessing specific web data located on a <strong>server</strong> (a computer hosting data for others to access). URLs can be broken into three parts:<br />
            <div class="sidenote">The <span class="red">protocol</span> is not visible in the location bar of some browsers (like Chrome).</div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/URL-structure.jpg" alt="parts of a URL" title="parts of a URL" />
            <ul>
                <li><span class="red">protocol</span>&mdash;the standard for communication between browsers and servers (usually "http" or "https")</li>
                <li><span class="darkgreen">domain name</span>&mdash;the name of the server that hosts the data</li>
                <li> <span class="blue">path</span>&mdash;the location of the data in a hierarchy of folders on the server </li>
                <div class="endnote">For example, the URL shown above tells a browser to use the <span class="red">http</span> protocol to access the <span class="darkgreen">bjc.berkeley.edu</span> server and then go to the <span class="blue">website</span> folder and open the <span class="blue">privacy.html</span> file.</div>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <img class="imageRight" height="100" src="http://snap.berkeley.edu/Logo5.png" alt="" title="" />
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
                    Describe the parts of this URL for the Snap<em>!</em> logo:<br />
                    <a class="indent" href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/Logo5.png" target="_blank">http://snap.berkeley.edu/Logo5.png</a>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>But the Internet is more general than the World Wide Web. It also supports email, file transfers, mobile apps, texting (a.k.a. SMS or Short Message Service), and many other ways that computers communicate behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is a massive network of computers that communicate, facilitating communication around the globe. They do this primarily by using a pair of <strong>protocols</strong> (standards for communication) that you will learn more about in another lab:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/1-ip.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment"><strong>IP</strong></a> (Internet Protocol), an addressing system that finds paths to distant computers</li>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/2-tcp.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment"><strong>TCP</strong></a> (Transmission Control Protocol), a reliable transmission system that sends and tracks <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/1-number-representation/2-binary-sequences.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">binary sequences of data</a> that are split into small packets sent separately</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
           The algorithms that ensure data reach their destinations must continue to work even as the Internet grows. So, the Internet was designed to be:
			<ul>
				<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/redundant-2.jpg" alt="network redundancy" title="network redundancy" />
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-reliable-communication/2-network-redundancy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment"><strong>Redundant</strong></a>: There are multiple pathways among the physical connections of the Internet to create redundancy. Even if one pathway is unavailable, there is still another way to transmit a message from sender to receiver (as shown right).</li>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-reliable-communication/3-address-hierarchy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment"><strong>Hierarchical</strong></a>: There are two hierarchical Internet addressing systems, domain names (as shown below) and <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/1-ip.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">IP addresses</a>. These address hierarchies works much like the postal system, which locates people first by state, then city, then street, then house number, then apartment, and then finally person.</li>
	            </ul>
            	The next two pages of this lab are about these two ideas.<br />

                    "BYOB" (a.k.a. Build Your Own Blocks) is the name of an early version of what become Snap<em>!</em>.  Visit each of these URLs:

                    Then draw a diagram like the one above that explains the behavior you observed.
