        <div class="learn">
	        <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn how the layout of the Internet is redundant (more than one path from here to there) in order to ensure reliability.</p>

            6.2.1A The Internet and the systems built on it are hierarchical and redundant.<br />
            <strong>6.2.2</strong> Explain how the characteristics of the Internet influence the systems built on it. [P4]<br />
            6.2.2A Hierarchy and redundancy help systems scale.<br />
            6.2.2B The redundancy of routing (i.e., more than one way to route data) between two points on the Internet increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.<br />
            6.2.1D Routing on the Internet is fault tolerant and redundant. <br />
        </div>
        
        <p>Given the enormous amount of data traveling around, the Internet needs to be reliable. We have achieved this by building many <strong>redundant</strong> connections into the physical systems of the Internet. Wherever information is going, there is more than one way to get there, so that if part of the Internet fails, the rest remains connected even if the failed part is in the usual path from one place to another. This increases the Internet's <strong>fault tolerance</strong> (ability to work around problems). And it also helps the Internet <strong>scale</strong> (expand) to more devices and people.</p>
		<div class="endnote">Internet <strong>scalability</strong> is the ability of the net to keep working even as the size of the network and the amount of traffic over the network increase.

                        In this model of a network, what is the <em>minimum</em> number of nodes (connection points) that can stop working before the sender and the receiver can't communicate? (Other than the sender or the receiver themselves, of course.)

                            There are no nodes that are vital to the system. Pick any node to stop working, and you can still find another path.
