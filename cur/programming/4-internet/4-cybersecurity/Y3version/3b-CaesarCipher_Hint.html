        <div class="todo">
            I've changed the <em>essential</em> element: Caesar Cipher is not  rightâ€”but I very strongly urge a bigger change: Please put the focus on the relevant part of the code, the material we are teaching, not the decorations around it. Despite the attempted disclaimer "possible steps" and "final code may look something like this," the page is an explicit recipe. And <em>most</em> of this recipe is not on topic: <em>all</em> of the first FYTD is about the interface, not about the encrypting algorithm. The only place students even have to pay attention to that algorithm is dismissed as "one small difference." I see this as a way to get students to <em>short run success</em> but not a way to get them to <em>succeed</em> in learning to program. The challenge in page 3 (not the hint) should be to develop the "guts" of the project, blocks that perform the <code>encode</code> and <code>decode</code> function, and the hint for students who need help should be to help them <em>structure</em> their thinking. It could say something like "problems like this can be simplified by separating them into two parts: creating a block to <code>encode one character</code>, and using that block <code>for</code> each character in a string. To encode a single character, we need to add something to the <code>unicode of</code> the character, and then <code>report</code> the <code>unicode of (that number) as letter</code>. The <code>for</code> block, running from the first character through the entire <code>length of</code> your text, can let you join each encoded character to the already encoded parts of the text."  If they need more help at this stage, by unit 4, there should be other students and the teacher to help. This gives them at least a chance to invent on their own. <br><br>
            ST-I have changed the writing here to address Paul's main concern that the whole hints page is a give away.  I agree with him, this has been an overarching  challenge for me while creating projects in general. I hope the new puzzle like structure presented here requiring assembling pieces together will present more of a challenge and involve some creative thinking.  On the issue of the initialization part of the code causing loss of focus, I respectfully disagree.  My experience is that kids actually focus better on the task at hand when they know where to start and have some warm up task that gets them make progress towards a big important task.  And also let's remember that this page is intended only for kids who are stuck.
            <p>Here's a modification. See if you like it. --MF</p>
            <p>ST- These modifications are acceptable to me</p>

        <h2>Shift Cipher Hints</h2>
        <div class="forYouToDo"><!-- I took off the id="first" because it's a hints page.  --MF, 2016-12-13 -->
        	<p>Here is an <em>example</em> algorithm for the shift cipher. Do it your way.</p>            
            <ol>
                <li>Create and initialize (<code>set</code> to blank) three variables to store <var>inputText</var>, <var>shiftValue</var>, and <var>outputText</var>.</li>
                <!--<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/img_CaesarCipher/Code1.png" width="189" alt="" /><br />-->
                <div class="sidenote"><em>Plaintext</em> (or cleartext) is normal unencrypted text.</div>
                <li><code>Ask</code> the user to enter a <strong>plaintext</strong> message to be encoded.  <code>Set</code> the <var>inputText</var> variable to the <var>answer</var> from the user.</li>
                <!--<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/img_CaesarCipher/Code2.png" width="246" alt="" /><br />-->
                <li>
                    <code>Ask</code> the user to enter a shift value for the shift cipher.  <code>If</code> their <var>answer</var> <code>is a number</code>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>Set</code> the <var>shiftValue</var> variable to their <var>answer</var>.  </li>
                        <li><code>Ask</code> the user if they wish to encode or decode.</li>
                        <li>Then call a custom procedure to encrypt or decrypt the data. Here is an <em>example</em> <code>encode</code> algorithm. You could:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use it and write a <code>decode</code> reporter block on your own.</li>
                                <li>Modify this into a <code>encode/decode</code> block that uses negative shift values to decode.</li>
                                <li>Or create your own custom procedure and ignore the example.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <div class="takeNote">Notice that <code>Encode</code> reporter relies on a simpler reporter, <code>Encode One Character</code>, that encodes a single character by shifting it a given amount. This abstraction makes the code easier to manage.</div>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Here are enough blocks to build <code>Encode One Character</code>:<br>

        		<!--<li>Now you are ready to write the <code>Encode</code> block.  Assemble these pieces together to do so:<br>
