        <p>A Caesar cipher (or shift cipher) is a simple and widely known encryption method. It's a substitution cipher. Each letter in the plaintext (un-encrypted text) shifts some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, “ABC123abc” shifted by 4 becomes “EFG567efg”. This technique is named after Gaius Julius Caesar, an influential Roman who ruled 49-44 BC and used encryption in his correspondence.</p>
        <p>In this project you will develop a simple message encryption program, using a method based on the “Caesar Cipher”.</p>

            	<li>Explore <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=selimtezel&ProjectName=CaesarCipher_Simplified&hideControls" target="_blank">this example project</a> and consider how you might design your own.</li>
            </ol>

        <p>Unicode is the computer industry standard for encoding characters.</p>
        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/img_CaesarCipher/Mary_CharacterTable.jpeg" width="550" alt="Unicode Table"/>
        <p>
            Access to the Unicode values in Snap<em>!</em> will be achieved by the following Operators blocks:<br>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/img_CaesarCipher/SnapUnicode1.png" alt="unicode of (a) reporting '97'" title="unicode of (a) reporting '97'" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/img_CaesarCipher/SnapUnicode2.png" alt="unicode (65) as letter reporting 'A'" title="unicode (65) as letter reporting 'A'" />
        </p>
        
        <div class="endnote">
        	<p>The Unicode key system employed by Snap<em>!</em> is vast so you can safely assume that any set of text characters to be encrypted will map to a set of printable characters, which may include characters such as : ; &lt; = &gt; ? @ ^ * { } ~.</p>
            <p>For example: Encrypted in a Caesar Cipher with a shift 4,</p>
            <p class="indent"><em><strong>Invasion of Normandy is on 6 June 1944</strong></em></p>
            <p>becomes:</p>
            <p class="indent"><em><strong>Mrzewmsr$sj$Rsvqerh}$mw$sr$:$Nyri$5=88</strong></em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="second">
            <ol start="2">
                <li>Use a Caesar Cipher to encrypt and decrypt a short message on paper to get a feel for how this cipher works.  Use the Unicode table given above as needed.</li> 
                <li> Develop a simple algorithm for this procedure that works for any input text and any given shift value.</li>
                <li>Try to code the simplified Caesar Cipher on your own in Snap<em>!</em> using the algorithm you have developed. If you get stuck, look at this <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-cybersecurity/3b-CaesarCipher_Hint.html" target="_blank">page for hints </a>on how to proceed.</li>
                <p>
                	You can extract the encrypted messages from the Snap<em>!</em> interface by right-clicking on the variable that holds the encrypted message and selecting the “Export” option which will download a text file to your computer which then you can copy/paste.<br />

                </p>
                <li>Now test your work. Agree with your partner on a shift value for the encryption.  Then use your program to encrypt a secret message and e-mail it to your partner.  Then let your partner, decrypt your message by using the program to reverse the shift.</li>

        </div>
        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <ol>
                <li>Implement a version of the Caesar Cipher that not only shifts the characters but also wraps them round the alphabet when the end of the alphabet is reached.  You may wish to restrict your alphabet to the set of printable characters given above in the Unicode table.</li>
                <li>If you came across a long message encrypted in the Caesar Cipher but did not know the shift value, what are some ways you might be able to break the system and decrypt the message?  Discuss the weaknesses of a Caesar Cipher and how it is prone to breaking.</li>
                <li>Do some research on other types of ciphers used historically. Especially read about the Vigenere Cipher which was used extensively in communicating sensitive information during World War 2.</li>
                <li>Watch the Oscar nominated movie <a href="https://youtu.be/S5CjKEFb-sM" target="_blank">“The Imitation Game” </a>which tells the story of Alan Turing and his team of cryptographers who broke the Nazi encryption system “Enigma” based on the Vigenere Cipher.  Research and discuss how this breakthrough ushered an era of research leading to the birth of modern Computer Science.</li>
                <li>Do some research to learn about <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-cybersecurity/4-asymmetric_cryptography.html" target="_blank">modern encryption systems </a>such as the RSA cryptosystem employed to do secure transactions on the internet.</li>
                <li>Create your own encryption/decryption scheme and implement it in Snap<em>!</em></li>
