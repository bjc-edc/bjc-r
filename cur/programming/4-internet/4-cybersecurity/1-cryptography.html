            6.3.1H Cryptography is essential to many models of cybersecurity.<br />
            6.3.1K Symmetric encryption is a method of encryption involving one key for encryption and decryption.<br />
            6.3.1L Public key encryption, which is not symmetric, is an encryption method that is widely used because of the enhanced security associated with its use.<br />

                <li>Write a secret message to send to a partner. Invent some way of encoding the message. Then send the <em>encoded</em> message to your partner.</li>
                <li>Your partner will send <em>you</em> an encoded message. When you get it, try to decode it. What strategies are you using to decode it?</li>

		<p>Cryptography is the study of how to convert messages into code (encryption) and how to solve codes (decryption). Just as TCP enables reliable transmission over an unreliable network, cryptography enables verifiable, secure transmission over an insecure network.</p>

            <p><strong><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/5-secure-communication/2-cryptography.html">Symmetric cryptography</a></strong>, uses the <em>same secret key</em> to encode and to decode a message. Symmetric cryptography has been around for thousands of years. The trouble with symmetric cryptography is: how can we keep the key secret?</p> 
            <p><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-cybersecurity/4-asymmetric_cryptography.html"><strong>Public key (asymmetric) cryptography</strong></a> was created by mathematicians in the 1970s.  It uses <em>two different keys</em> for encryption and decryption, so sharing the public encryption key doesn't give away the private decryption key.</p>
        </div>
		<div class="endnote">Banks use public key cryptography. When users enter their password on a bank's web site, the user's browser uses the bank's public key to encrypt the password  before sending it over the Internet. Only the bank can decrypt that password, using their private key.</div>
