            The picture below is a simple visualization of a brick wall that can be drawn using <span class="snap">snap</span> 
        </p>
		<p>
			<span style="margin-left: 40px;"><img border="0" title="Sample image of brick wall" alt="Sample image of brick wall" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/cat-wall.png" /></span>

            In this activity you will be drawing this same brick wall.  Remember to use functional decomposition
            as much as you can so that your final <img class="inline" alt="brick wall block" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/brickwall/draw-brick-wall-num.png">
            block is easy to understand.  The following hints might be helpful:
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You can use a thick red pen to draw a single brick.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    There are two types of rows both composed of bricks.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Not all of the bricks are the same size.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
