        <p>
            Gregory basically works like this: It first creates lists of keywords and responses, then takes an input, turns that input (a string) into a list for analysis, then changes certain lists of responses based on the input, selects an appropriate response, and uses that response, asking for an input again and thus entering a conversational loop. Responses also have priorities: wishing to exit the session is more important than asking a question, and profanity needs to be addressed from the outset to avoid Gregory accidentally cussing out the user.

        <p>
            One of the problems with Gregory is that at the moment he only works with the user's most recent input. ELIZA could improve conversationally over time by referencing its memory.
