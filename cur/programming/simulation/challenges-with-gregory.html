            John Searle posed the issue of the Chinese room, which proposes that artificial intelligence can be reached by appropriate output to a given input. Therefore artificial intelligence refinement is based on making input processing more sophisticated. The next two problems deal with Gregory's input processing.

                Gregory does not handle punctuation, which is to say that if a keyword is at the end of the sentence with punctuation, Gregory will not respond to that keyword. Resolve this issue.

                There are some grammatical patterns that pronounSwitch returns an incorrect pronounSwitchedString for. For example, the answer "you are" will return "I am" in pronounSwitchedString, but "we are" will return "we am". Resolve this issue.
