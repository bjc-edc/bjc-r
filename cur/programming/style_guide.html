        <h2>We'll Start out with "h2" Tags with Title Case at the Highest Level Because "h1" is Just Massive</h2>
        <h3>Then We Can Use "h3" for Sub-Headings</h3>
        <h4>And "h4" for Sub-Sub-Headings (if we ever need them)</h4>
		<div class="imageRight"><img src="/bjc-r/img/pictures/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss.jpg" alt="an image on the right"></div>
        <div>
        	For the general text, please wrap everything in "div" tags. Intent code with 4 spaces (one tab) with each new level. Images are also wrapped in "div" tags. Images can be placed on either side using class="imageRight" and class="imageLeft" in the "div" tag.
        </div>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <div>
                This is a made with a div within a div. The class of the surrounding div is "forYouToDo".<br />
                <ol>
                    <li>Read this and your dog will be happy:<br />
                        <ol>
                            <li>Sub-pr0blem 1</li>

                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Then think about how to code this picture: <br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/topic1_kaleidoscopegif.gif" alt="this is a picture. isn't it nice? ;)"></li>
                    <li>Un Otro Problemo... et cetero...</li>

        <div><div class="sidenote">Side notes contain content that is interesting or potentially helpful but not essential.</div></div>

		<div class="dialogue">
            <div>
            	<span>Mary:</span> says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff

		<div class="takeItFurther">
            <div>
                Here is a list of other formatting we can use:<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the "code" tag for <code>code</code>. Reference blocks (e.g. <code>pen down</code>) using the "code" tag or an image of the actual block.</li>
                    <li>Use the "strong" tag for <strong>bold</strong>. Introduce <strong>new terms</strong> using the strong tag.</li>
                    <li>Use the "em" tag for <em>italics</em>. The "em" tag is for <em>em</em>phasis.</li>
                    <!-- block (code tag) vs. palette (quotes) vs. variable (italics, but even if block?) vs. new term (bold)-->
                </ul>
        	</div>
        </div>

		<div> 
        	Let's not use the following colored boxes at all:
        </div>
        <div class="alert quoteBlue">Blue Box - determine the meaning of these elements on a case by case basis and use one of our styles above instead.</div>
        <div class="alert quoteGreen">Green Box - use EDC version</div>
        <div class="alert quoteOrange">Orange Box - etc.</div>
        <div class="alert quoteYellow">Yellow Box - same thing ;)</div>
		<div>
        	(If we like the look, we can reintegrated them, but for now, let's change each one over to our own styles above. I asked, and these didn't have much specific meaning in previous BJC versions.)
        </div>
    </body>
