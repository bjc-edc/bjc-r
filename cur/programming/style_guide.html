        <h2>We'll Start out with "h2" Tags with Title Case at the Highest Level Because "h1" is Just Massive</h2>
        <h3>Then We Can Use "h3" for Sub-Headings</h3>
        <h4>And "h4" for Sub-Sub-Headings (if we ever need them)</h4>
		<div class="imageRight"><img src="/bjc-r/img/pictures/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss.jpg" alt="an image on the right"></div>
        <div>
        	For the general text, please wrap everything in "div" tags. Intent code with 4 spaces (one tab) with each new level. Images are also wrapped in "div" tags. Images can be placed on either side using class="imageRight" and class="imageLeft" in the "div" tag.
        </div>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <div>
                This is a made with a div within a div. The class of the surrounding div is "forYouToDo".<br />
                <ol>
                    <li>Read this and your dog will be happy:<br />
                        <ol>
                            <li>Sub-pr0blem 1</li>
                            <li>Sub-probl3m 2</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Then think about how to code this picture: <br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/topic1_kaleidoscopegif.gif" alt="this is a picture. isn't it nice? ;)"></li>
                    <li>Un Otro Problemo... et cetero...</li>
                     
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
        	<ol start="4">
            	<li>To avoid having the title "For You To Do" appear several times on the same page, use id="first" for the first instance of class="forYouToDo" and not in the others. (Note: ID is used for something that only appears once; we are IDing that one as the first one.)</li>
                <li>Note that this second For You To Do also differs in that the &lt;ol&gt; tag has start="4" inside it so that the list starts in the right place.</li>
            </ol>
        </div> 

        <div><div class="sidenote">Side notes contain content that is interesting or potentially helpful but not essential.</div></div>

		<div class="dialogue">
            <div>
            	<span>Mary:</span> says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff
            </div>
            <div>
            	<span>Brian:</span> says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff says some stuff

        </div>

		<div class="takeItFurther">
            <div>
                Here is a list of other formatting we can use:<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    	Use the "code" tag for <code>code</code>. Reference blocks (e.g. <code>pen down</code>) using the "code" tag or an image of the actual block: <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pen-down.png" class="block"/>.) 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Note: The <code>code</code> tag has been used all over the place in the previous version of BJC. Please try to keep it to only actual code blocks.</li>
                            <li>Re: variables and mathematics&mdash;If you are referencing a mathematical variable that you have made into a <span class="snap">snap</span> variable (hence, a block) then use the code tag (or an image of the block). If you are referencing the plus/minus/etc. block, use the code tag (or an image of the block). If you are just discussing a mathematical idea, then use regular notation: e.g. <em>x</em> + <em>y</em> = 7. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>                   
                    <li>Use the "strong" tag for <strong>bold</strong>. Introduce <strong>new terms</strong> using the strong tag.</li>
                    <li>Use the "em" tag for <em>italics</em>. The "em" tag is for <em>em</em>phasis.</li>
                    <!-- block (code tag) vs. palette (quotes) vs. variable (italics, but even if block?) vs. new term (bold)-->
                    <li>References to text in the app (such as the "OK" button or the "Motion" palette) should be in quotes.</li>
                </ul>
        	</div>
        </div>

		<div> 
        	Let's not use the following colored boxes at all:
        </div>
        <div class="alert quoteBlue">Blue Box - determine the meaning of these elements on a case by case basis and use one of our styles above instead.</div>
        <div class="alert quoteGreen">Green Box - use EDC version</div>
        <div class="alert quoteOrange">Orange Box - etc.</div>
        <div class="alert quoteYellow">Yellow Box - same thing ;)</div>
		<div>
        	(If we like the look, we can reintegrate them, but for now, let's change each one over to our own styles above. I asked, and these didn't have much specific meaning in previous BJC versions.)
        </div>
    </body>
