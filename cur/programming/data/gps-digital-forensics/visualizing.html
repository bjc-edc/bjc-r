            Visualizing the Data in <span class="snap">snap</span>

        <p>
            Let's go to <span class="snap">Snap</span> and visualize the data.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Use the <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/data/gps-digital-forensics.xml">
                gps-digital-forensics starter project</a> to get started.  You'll see
                that the stage has a nice grid for a background image, and the sprite has a
                circle costume to stamp coordinates with.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now get the GPS coordinates into a <span class="snap">Snap</span> list.
                You'll need separate numbers for each longitude and latitude, so each
                element of your main list of data should be a list with two entries (one
                for each coordinate).
            </li>
            <li>
                There is an example script in the starter project that
                draws a dot at <code>50</code>, <code>50</code>.  Use your list of
                data to draw each coordinate on the screen.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Now, that you've visualized the data, discuss with your peers:
        </p>
        <p class="step">
            Do you have any hypotheses for the case?
        </p>
        <p class="step">
            How could you test them?
        </p>
