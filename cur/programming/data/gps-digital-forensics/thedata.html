    The data given to you are 10 GPS coordinates, which can be used
    to determine a location on the Earth.  Each row is a separate 
    coordinate, consisting of two numbers,a latitude followed by a
longitude.  Locations in this format are called <i>Decimal Degrees</i>:
</p>

            
            

    <p class="center alert quoteBlue"><b><font size="+1">DDD.DDDDD&deg; </font></b> (latitude), 
        <b><font size="+1">DDD.DDDDD&deg;</font></b> (longitude) </p>
          
    
     <p>For example, the decimal degree <code>37.873808</code>,<code>-122.254173</code> 
         indicates a 
         <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=37.873808%20-122.254173#map=9/37.8749/-122.2531">location</a>
         that refers to the Greek Theater at U.C. Berkeley. </p>
     
     
    <p>
    This is the format you'll find most computer based mapping systems
    displaying. The coordinates are stored internally in a floating
    point data type, and no additional work is required to print them as
    a floating point number. Positive values of latitude are north of
    the equator, negative values to the south. Watch the sign on the
    longitude, most programs use negative values for west longitude.
    This saves a lazy western hemisphere programmer from having to type
    in a minus sign before most of their longitude values. ;-)

    with the lab, but if you are interested, read the following quick
