            Suddenly, your crime-fighter colleagues come in and have a hunch:
            Maybe there was more than one perpetrator? The messages were
            collected in a very short time and no major movement was observed.
            So they ask you to confirm or deny the hypothesis that the messages
            come from more than one source and if so from how many.
        </p>

        <h2>Clustering</h2>
        <p>
            Clearly, all coordinates have different values.  So we
            have to find out if certain points are closer to other points and if
            that's a pattern. In other words:
        </p>
        <p class="step">
            Can we group the points into distinct <span
            style="font-style: italic;">clusters</span>?
        </p>
        <p class="step">
            How many clusters
            are best?  It wouldn't add much information if each point was in its own cluster, or
            if we grouped all of them into a single large cluster.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to do clustering, we need two main processes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A method to how close points are to each other. This is called a
                distance metric.  An easy to use metric is the Euclidean
                Distance <code>d</code>, which is accurate for <i>XY</i> coordinates
                on flat surfaces (as a disclaimer, GPS coordiates are not used on a flat 
                surface&mdash;i.e., the Earth!  But, for coordinates all in a small area, 
                Euclidean distance does good enough).
                <br><Br>
                Given two points <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>, each with coordinates <code>p1<sub>lat</sub></code>
                and <code>p1<sub>long</sub></code> and <code>p2<sub>lat</sub></code>
                and <code>p2<sub>long</sub></code>, the euclidean distance
                is given
                as
                <br>
                <Br>

            </li>
            <li>
                A method to determine if a point belongs to a cluster or not.
                A cluster is a set
                of points, and we'll use our distance metric to compare
                the point in question (lets call it <code>p1<sub>outside?</sub></code>)
                with the points that are in the cluster.
                That will give you a list of distances (as many as there are
                points in the cluster),
                so you'll need to use that list to figure out if
                <code>p1<sub>outside?</sub></code> should be considered a member
                of the cluster.

                <br>
                <br>
                You can do this in various ways; let's choose an easy one:
                figure out if the minimum distance in your list is less than
                some predetermined value.
                What this means, then, is that <code>p1<sub>outside?</sub></code>
                belongs to a cluster if the distance between it and
                the closet point in the cluster is "close enough".
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        In <span class="snap">snap</span>,
        you'll make a block for each of these processes.these two blocks should look like this, once you have
        implemented them:
</p>
        <img class="indent"
        src="/bjc-r/img/data/distance-1-2-to-4-6.png" alt="'distance from (1,2) to (4,6)' showing 5">

        <br>and<br>

        <img class="indent"
        src="/bjc-r/img/data/distance-1-2-to-cluster.png" alt="'distance from (1,2) to cluster ((4,6), (40,60))' showing 5">
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
        Before you use your two new blocks, let's first take a look at
        the data by extending the previously introduced
        (<a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/data/clustering.xml">visualization code</a>):
        </p>

        As the comments already indicate, you need to add the pre-processed
        coordinates as lists (points) of lists (coordinates). If you followed the recommendation under pre-processing, you have these in a text editor and need to copy and paste them into the CLUSTER DATA list. In the next line, we start by
        defining three cluster center points that we eye-balled from the
        data. Then, in the following line, we set our minimum distance for a point belonging to a
        cluster to 50.
        </p><p>
        Play around with the numbers to see if you can find better clusters.
        How many clusters do you feel are optimal and what are their
        parameters?
