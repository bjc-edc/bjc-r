            Classifying SPAM

        <p>
            Now that you know that the average length differs,  build a
            simple classifier based on the number of words in a particular message.
            That is, write a block that takes in a message and, based on how many
            words it contains, returns either "ham" or "spam" as its classification.
        </p>

            Implement in <span class="snap">snap</span>, and use it to classify
            the messages in our data.  You can use a regular loop to call your classify
            on the second item in each row of the data, or you might use this
            <i>faster</i> method using <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="the keep block">:
