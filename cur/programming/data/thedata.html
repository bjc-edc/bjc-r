    <title>How GPS DATA Works</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    The data given to you are GPS coordinates that determine locations.
    In particular, the format that is given is that of <span
      style="font-style: italic;">Decimal Degrees</span>:<br>
    <p><b><font size="4">DDD.DDDDD&deg; (latitude), </font></b><b><font
          size="4">DDD.DDDDD&deg; (longitude) </font></b><br>
      <b><font size="4">for example 37.869000 -122.272999</font></b></p>
    This is the format you'll find most computer based mapping systems
    displaying. The coordinates are stored internally in a floating
    point data type, and no additional work is required to print them as
    a floating point number. Positive values of latitude are north of
    the equator, negative values to the south. Watch the sign on the
    longitude, most programs use negative values for west longitude.
    This saves a lazy western hemisphere programmer from having to type
    in a minus sign before most of their longitude values. ;-)<br>

    It's not necessary for you to know more than that for continuing
    with the lab, but if you are interested, read the following quick
    introduction on how GPS coordinates work: <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2209240_read-gps-coordinates.html">E-How
      Tutorial on GPS coordinates</a>. In anyways, go ahead and post the
    above coordinates into <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> to
    find out where they point to!<br>
