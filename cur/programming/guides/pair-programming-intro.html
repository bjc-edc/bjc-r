        <h2>Introduction to Pair Programming</h2>

        <div>
In this course, you will use a technique that professional programmers call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" target="_blank">pair programming</a>&mdash;writing computer programs in teams of two people. One partner, the &quot;driver,&quot;  writes the program that controls the computer; the other partner, the &quot;navigator,&quot; helps plan and helps catch errors. </div>

        <div>
             <em>Switch roles often</em>, trying for equal time in each role. That helps ensure that each partner understands all parts of the program, and that the person in each role remains focused. As you progress through labs, we will suggest places for you to switch.
