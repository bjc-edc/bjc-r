        <h2>Introduction to Pair Programming</h2>

        <div>
In this course, you will use a technique that professional programmers call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" target="_blank">pair programming</a>&mdash;writing computer programs in teams of two people. One partner, the "driver,&quot;  writes the program that controls the computer; the other partner, the "navigator," observes and helps plan and catch errors. </div>

        <div>
             <em>Switch roles fairly often</em> and try to get equal time  in both roles. That helps ensure that each partner has a good understanding of all parts of the program, and that the person in each role remains focused. As you progress through labs, we will suggest places for you to switch. 
            </p>

            <div>
             Now is a good time to switch roles! If you've been the <em>navigator</em>, switch and become the <em>driver</em>.
