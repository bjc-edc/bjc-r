			<p>Thomas (David) Petite (born 1956) is a member of the Fond du Lac Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa tribe. David is best known for his work on wireless enabled devices. He is one of the early inventors of the wireless ad hoc networks, a temporary decentralized type of wireless network that enables all mobile phones to work today. His inventions were also a driving force behind the development of what is now known as the "Smart Grid" which monitors and harnesses the power of wireless-enabled devices at a specific location.</p>

				<p>Mary Golda Ross (1908–2008) was a ground-breaking Native American engineer and the first female employed by Lockheed, an American aerospace technology corporation. Ross was passionate about educating women and Native Americans and spent over ten years teaching while earning her Master’s degree in mathematics during the summer.  Lockheed hired her as a mathematician in 1942.  During her thirty-plus years there, Ross contributed to cutting-edge aerospace designs including concepts for interplanetary space travel, crewed and uncrewed Earth-orbiting flights, and orbiting satellites.</p>
