David is best known for his work on wireless enabled devices. He is one of the early inventors of the wireless ad hoc networks, a temporary decentralized type of wireless network that enables all mobile phones to work today. His inventions were also a driving force behind the development of what is now known as the "Smart Grid" which monitors and harnesses the power of wireless-enabled devices at a specific location.</p>			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_David_Petite" title="Wikipedia Article on Thomas Petite" target="_blank">Learn More</a></p>		</div><div class="atwork"> <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/atwork.html">4.1.3</a>				<div class="imageRight">					<img class="noshadow" height="200px" src="/bjc-r/img/atwork/Vint_Cert.jpeg" alt="photo of Vint Cert" title="photo of Vint Cert">				</div>				<p>Vint Cerf (born 1943) is an American Internet pioneer and is recognized as one of "the fathers of the Internet."

Ross was passionate about educating women and Native Americans and spent over ten years teaching while earning her Master’s degree in mathematics during the summer.  Lockheed hired her as a mathematician in 1942.  During her thirty-plus years there, Ross contributed to cutting-edge aerospace designs including concepts for interplanetary space travel, crewed and uncrewed Earth-orbiting flights, and orbiting satellites.</p>				<p><a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/mary-g-ross-aerospace-engineer" title="Article: Aerospace Engineer, Educator, and Advocate" target="_blank">Article: Aerospace Engineer, Educator, and Advocate</a></p>			</div></body>
