			When you put two "When green flag ..." hat blocks in the same sprite, both will run at the same time! 
			Similarly, if multiple sprites all have "When green flag..." hat blocks, 
			these will run concurrently as well. 
			
			</p>
			<p>Load up <code><a href="/bjc-r/prog/BYOB/SerialVsParallelBuggy.ypr">SerialVsParallelBuggy.ypr</a></code>, 
				and click the green flag.  Two things will get drawn:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
				You'll see one 'serial' gold square sprite (ten pixels on a side) paint the area on the right by stamping itself. 
				</li>
				<li>
				You'll also see two blue 'parallel' 10x10 sprites sharing the labor of painting the area on the left by stamping themselves. 
				</li>
				</ul>

			<p>			(Two screenshots are included below)
					The first thing to note is that the parallel side finished in exactly half the time of the serial side.
					 Discuss with your partner why this is.
			</p>
				<p>
					The second thing to note is that there is a slight concurrency bug. 
					The first blue squares for the 1 and 2 sprites appear not to get stamped. 
					Fix this bug so that there are no missing stamps.
