  <title>Using The Check Block</title>
</head>

<body>
  <p>As we observed on the previous page the check block is most useful at points in our code where we expect things to
  change in a certain predicatble way. We can then input a predicate to enforce what we think should happen and the
  check block will catch us if something goes wrong. We are then left with what to put inside the C-shaped area. Using
  the <img class="inline" alt="show variable block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/show-variable.png"> block is often a good
  idea as we can display the values that seem to be going wrong; however, we can also place say blocks or other things
  into this area if we think that they will give us helpful hints as to what the error might be.</p>
