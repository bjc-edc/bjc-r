        <p>
            From the previous exercise, you may have figured out
            what the
            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png" alt="Forever block"/>
            block does. The <b>forever</b> block is the
            first block you have see that holds, or wraps around, other blocks.
            We call this a <em>C block</em> because of its shape.  As the name <b>forever</b> implies, it will run the blocks inside it again and
            again and again and ... well, forever.
