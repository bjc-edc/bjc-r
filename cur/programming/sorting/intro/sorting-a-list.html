In the rest of today's lab, we will tackle the problem of sorting a list: we have a list of numbers or letters, and we want to arrange them in a particular order.  We are going to look at one algorithm (out of many!) to sort a list of numbers or words.  Whenever we read a new algorithm, we need to step back and see the Big Picture: what task is this algorithm trying to accomplish, and how is it going to approach this task?  For this new sorting algorithm, the Big Picture is:

<ul><li>We are going to keep some part of the list always sorted.  In other words, we will separate the list into two parts: a <em>sorted</em> part and an <em>unsorted</em> part.</li>
  <li>Each time a loop runs, we will move one more item up into the sorted section.</li>
  <li>Eventually, we will have seen every element in the list and we will have placed it into its proper position.</li>
</ul>

Let us attempt a step-by-step description of this algorithm:

<ul><li>We start off with just the first element, and we already know that the first element, by itself, is already sorted.</li>
<li>Next, we add the second element of the list into its correct position, so that the first and second elements are sorted.</li>
<li>Next, we add the third element of the list into the correct position so that the first through third elements are sorted.</li>
<li>Next, we add the fourth element of the list into the correct position so that the first through fourth elements are sorted.</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>Finally, we add the last element of the list into the correct position so that the first through last elements are sorted, and the list is itself sorted.</li>
</ul>

Below, we show the algorithm running on a particular list.  Make sure that you understand this algorithm before you proceed.  In the next step, you will be writing this program.
