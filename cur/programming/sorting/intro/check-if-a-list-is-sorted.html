Now that you are familiar using lists as an argument, work with your partner to make the following predicate block that detects if the elements of a list are in order.

<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/is-list-in-order-block-BYOB.gif" alt="'is list in order?' predicate" title="'is list in order?' predicate" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab05/Lists/IsSorted/Block.gif"></div>

<h2>Test Cases</h2>
Below, we show an example where your new block should return <code>true</code> and where your new block should return <code>false</code>.

<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">

<br><em>Note</em>: When comparing two letters, Scratch and BYOB do not care about capital letters: <code>A</code> is equivalent to <code>a</code>.

<br><br>

You should think about what other good test cases would be.  For example, you should think about what should happen if there are no elements or if there is only one element.  These test cases check the <strong>corner cases</strong>.  The normal test cases, which most people will remember to make, check whether the block works for a list with a lot of elements.  However, it is as important to think about what it will do for no elements or one element.  This makes your script more <strong>robust</strong>: it allows your script to act properly in case of unexpected or tricky input.

<br><br><strong>Stuck?</strong> If you get stuck, we have provided a hint in the next section.

<h2>Boolean values</h2>

When returning <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, make sure that you use the blocks that Scratch and BYOB have provided especially for this purpose, in the <code>Operators</code> tab:

<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">

<br><code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are known as <strong>boolean values</strong>.  Notice that they have a hexagonal shape, which means they can fit into any hexagonal slots.  This also means that any block with a hexagonal shape returns boolean values, and in many programming languages -- Scratch and BYOB included -- boolean values are treated as a special <strong>boolean type</strong>.

Boolean values are named after George Boole, a 19th century mathematician who first proposed using <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> as the basis for logical thinking.   </body></html>
