		<p>
			Think about how fast you could do this <i>if you had the whole class to help</i>.
			What would your strategy be?
			As partners, write a detailed description of your strategy. Your teacher will 
			have you share it with the rest of the class.
			After simply <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reading</span> your description, your fellow students should be able to act it out! So make sure you are clear in your explanation!
		</p>
		<p>
			After your fellow student teams have written their strategies,
			you will choose two of them and make a prediction about how long the card sorting would take.
			(Remember how long it took you to card sort alone...)
