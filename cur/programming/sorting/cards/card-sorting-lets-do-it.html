			Get up and do it!
		</p>
		<p>
			Your instructor will break you up into teams.
			As a team, pick one of the strategies that was posted in the last activity.
			Using a watch or cell phone timer, time yourselves.
			Start when you are handed the randomly shuffled deck and end when
			you finally have it sorted. (It might be easier if your instructor,
			or another student, times you).
