      <div><span>Alphie:</span> Great, so now we know a bunch of functions that <em>won't</em> help us. How <em>do</em> we write <code>increasing?</code></div>
      <div><span>Betty:</span> Let's try talking through what we want the code to do. You know, the algorithm.</div>
      <div><span>Alphie:</span> Ok. We could compare item 1 to item 2 and check that item 1 is less. Then compare item 2 to item 3, then item 3 to... How would we know when to stop?</div>
      <div><span>Betty:</span> Well, the last item would be item "length of list."</div>
      <div><span>Alphie:</span> Ok. So then we would have a list of "true"s and "false"s. And then I guess </div>
      <div><span>Betty:</span> I think it works, too. But... </div>
          <div class="stagedir">They pause to think.</div>
      <div><span>Alphie:</span> This is kind of a boring example, but I guess you could start with a list of numbers, keep the ones that were greater than 50, add 10 to all of them, and then add those new numbers up.</div>
      <div><span>Betty:</span> Let's try it. I'm just going to make up a variable called "list of numbers". Then we'll keep the numbers over 50.</div>
          <div class="stagedir"><img border="0" title="keep(()>50)from(listofNumbers)" alt="keep(()>50)from(listofNumbers)" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep_listofNum.png" /></div>
      <div><span>Alphie:</span> Then we add 10 to every item, so use <code>map</code>... The list we're mapping over is everything we kept, so let's just drag everything in the the <code>keep</code> block in there.</div>
          <div class="stagedir"><img border="0" title="map(()+10)over(keep...)" alt="map(()+10)over(keep...)" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep_map.png" /></div>
      <div><span>Betty:</span> The last thing was to add all the numbers, right? So we'll use <code>combine with</code> addition, and our list is everything in the <code>map</code> block.</div>
          <div class="stagedir"><img border="0" title="combine(addition)itemsof(map(keep...))" alt="combine(addition)itemsof(map(keep...))" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep_map_combine.png" /></div>

        <p>
            Consider the following problem:
        </p>
        <div class="alert quoteGreen">
            <p>
                Write a predicate <code>increasing?</code> that takes a list of numbers as input, and outputs <code>true</code> if the numbers are in increasing order (equal neighbors are okay), or <code>false</code> otherwise.
            </p>
            <p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/hof/increasing-list-true-report.png" alt="increasing of (1 3 4 10) returning true">
              <br>
              <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/hof/increasing-list-false-report.png" alt="increasing of (1 7 4 10) returning false">
            </p>
            <p>(The question mark at the end of the name is a convention for predicates â€” blocks that answer yes-or-no questions. &quot;Is this list increasing?&quot;)</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Because this is a predicate, it's tempting to try to make it use <code>keep</code>:
        </p>
        <img class= "indent" border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/wannabe-increasing.png"
        alt="report <empty? (keep items such that (<() < (???)>) from (list)"
        title="report <empty? (keep items such that (<() < (???)>) from (list)"/>

        <p>
            But <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code> work when each item in a list
            can be considered independently of the others.
            In this problem we have to
            consider each item <b>in relation to</b> the ones that have come before it:
            "<i>Is this number at least as big as the ones we've already seen?</i>"

        </p>
        <p>
            To do this, we need to write a loop.
            The loop needs to go through the lists items, from left to right, and keep track of the last item that
            it saw.
            But, as with <code>map</code>, we don't need to keep track of
            the specific number of where we are in the list (e.g., the third position, the first position, etc.)
            Those index numbers have nothing to do with the problem we're trying to solve.
            The solution is to use the <code>for each item</code> block, this way:
        </p>

        <img class="indent" border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/increasing.png" alt="definition of INCREASING? block" title="definition of INCREASING? block"/>
        <p>
            Like the functions used as input to <code>map</code> and friends,
            the script inside the C-shaped slot of <code>for each item</code>
            interprets empty input slots (in the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>set</code> blocks)
            as placeholders into which an item of the list will be entered.
            <code>For each item</code> promises to go through the list starting with item <code>1</code> and continuing in sequence to the end of the list. We use a script variable <code>minimum</code> to remember the most recent item's value, which is the
            minimum allowable value for the next item. If any item is smaller than that
            remembered value, <code>increasing?</code> reports <code>false</code>.
            If we make it to the end of the list without violating that requirement,
            then <code>increasing?</code> reports <code>true</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the <code>for each item</code> block has the word &quot;item&quot;
            in a round orange block. It's a variable, and you can drag it into the script
            that goes inside the C-slot, instead of using an empty input to
            represent the list item:
        </p>
