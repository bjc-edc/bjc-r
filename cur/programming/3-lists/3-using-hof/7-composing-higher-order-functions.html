<h2>Composing higher-order functions</h2>

<div class="dialogue">
  <div><span>Alphie:</span> <code>Map</code> applies some function to each item of a list.</div>
  <div><span>Betty:</span> <code>Keep</code> lets you choose some items and not others.</div>
  <div><span>Alphie:</span> And <code>combine</code> takes all the items and combines them into a single output somehow.</div>
  <div><span>Betty:</span> Can you think of a situation where we would use all three of the functions together?</div>
      <div class="stagedir">They pause to think.</div>
  <div><span>Alphie:</span> This is kind of a boring example, but I guess you could start with a list of numbers, keep the ones that were greater than 50, add 10 to all of them, and then add those new numbers up.</div>
  <div><span>Betty:</span> Let's try it. I'm just going to make up a variable called "list of numbers". Then we'll keep the numbers over 50.</div>
      <div class="stagedir"><img border="0" title="keep(()>50)from(listofNumbers)" alt="keep(()>50)from(listofNumbers)" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep_listofNum.png" /></div>
  <div><span>Alphie:</span> Then we add 10 to every item, so use <code>map</code>... The list we're mapping over is everything we kept, so let's just drag everything in the the <code>keep</code> block in there.</div>
  	  <div class="stagedir"><img border="0" title="map(()+10)over(keep...)" alt="map(()+10)over(keep...)" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep_map.png" /></div>
  <div><span>Betty:</span> The last thing was to add all the numbers, right? So we'll use <code>combine with</code> addition, and our list is everything in the <code>map</code> block.</div>

<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
	<li>Here are some made-up data from an ice cream shop. Each of the smaller lists represents one day's sales at the shop. <br><a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3Lab3IceCreamShop.xml"> <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/icecream.png" alt="made-up sales data from an ice cream shop" title="made-up sales data from an ice cream shop" /> </a>

        	<li>The first number is the day's high temperature.</li>
            <li>The second is the number of popsicles sold.</li>
            <li>The third number is the number of ice cream cones sold.</li>
            <li>Popsicles sell for $1.50 each.</li>
            <li>Ice cream cones sell for $3.75 each.</li>
        </ul>
        Use <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine with</code> together in a single block that calculates the total amount of money the shop made by selling popsicles and ice cream on the days when the high temperature was over 80 degrees.</li>
	<li><div class="sidenote">This problem doesn't need <code>keep</code>. What kind of code might need <code>keep</code>? One way might be to limit the coded message to upper case letters, so that anything that's not an upper case letter gets removed.</div>Every character you type can be represented as a number.

	<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-to-a-partner.png" alt="Talk to a Partner" /> Think of another situation where it might be useful to use <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine with</code> together. Make up a list and describe how you would use the three functions together.</li>

<p><br>
  Suppose we want the squares of all the items of a list of numbers. That's a straightforward <code>map</code> problem:<br>
<img border="0" title="map (() * ()) over list" alt="map (() * ()) over list" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/mapsq.png"/>

<br><br>
Now suppose instead that we want to select the odd numbers from a list of numbers. It's a little tricky figuring out how to tell if a number is odd, but apart from that it's a straightforward <code>keep</code> problem:<br>
<img border="0" title="keep items such that <(() mod (2)) = (1)> from list..." alt="keep items such that <(() mod (2)) = (1)> from list..." src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/keepodds.png"/>

<br><br>
But what if we want the squares of the odd numbers? This is neither a simple <code>map</code> nor a simple <code>keep</code>, but combines aspects of both. And we can solve the problem by using the value reported by the <code>keep</code> as the list input to <code>map</code>:<br>
<img border="0" title="map square over keep odds from list" alt="map square over keep odds from list" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/sq-odds.png"/>

<br>
Don't be confused about which inputs do and don't have rings. It's the square <u>function</u> and the are-you-odd? <u>function</u> that we use as the first input to each higher order function. But, even though <code>keep</code> itself is a function, it's <i>the <u>list</u> reported by <code>keep </code></i>that we're using as the second input to <code>map</code>.

</p><br>We're building up to one the great beautiful procedures you'll see in this course: We want to take a phrase, such as &quot;Beauty and Joy of Computing,&quot; and report its acronym, the word BJC. You've explored two of the pieces of this problem in previous activities:
<br>   - Select only the words with five or more letters.<br>   - Make a list of the first letters of the words.
<br>Review those activities if you don't remember how to solve those problems.

<p>But there are two more steps, one at the beginning of the problem and one at the end, both related to the fact that people (the users of your program) want to see words and phrases in the form of text strings, but as you've seen, it's much easier to compute functions of those words and sentences if we have them in the form of lists, so we can use the higher order functions you're learning.

</p>
To translate from a text string to a list of words, <span class="snap">snap</span>  provides the reporter <code>sentence-&gt;list</code> (pronounced &quot;sentence to list&quot;) that takes a text string as input and reports a list of words:<br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/stol-bjc.png" alt="sentence->list block" title="sentence->list block"/>
<br>As usual, you see only the first three list elements in the speech balloon, but you're told at the bottom that the length of the list is 5, as it should be for the five words in the given phrase.

<p>Once we have the list, we can use the tools we've already built to get a list of the first letters of the long words. What we want, though, is a single word as the reported value. We can use one of the higher order functions to join the letters into a string.

</p><b>Try this: </b>Should we use <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, or <code>combine</code> for this purpose?

<p>Here's the final result:<br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/acronym.png" alt="acronym definition" title="acronym definition" /><br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/bad-bjc.png" alt="acronym reports BC instead of BJC" title="acronym reports BC instead of BJC"/>
<br>Oops! The word &quot;Joy&quot; is shorter than five letters, but it's still an important word in the acronym. We need a better algorithm.

</p><br><br><b>Try this: <br></b>
Modify the <code>acronym</code> block so that, instead of keeping long words, it keeps words that start with a capital letter. (Hint: Experiment with the <code>unicode of</code> block.)<br>
