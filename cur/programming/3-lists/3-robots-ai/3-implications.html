    	<h2>Implications of AI</h2>
        <div class="todo">From BJCx: How do you feel about the advancements in Artificial Intelligence that are allowing computers to continue to be better than humans in so many activities?  Do you believe (as many do) that machines will eventually challenge us (and in the worst case, take over), or will they hit an upper-limit and never develop to that point? --MF, 12/17/16</div>

                    Bias and AI: Because machine learning algorithms use existing data to develop "understanding" of the world, they are influenced by exisiting biases in the data. Research this issue and discuss how AI researchers might overcome this problem.

                    Throughout this course you have seen that technology has both benefits and risks. Imagine yourself working in the field of AI or robotics. What are you interested in working on? What are the benefits? How will you minimize the risks?
