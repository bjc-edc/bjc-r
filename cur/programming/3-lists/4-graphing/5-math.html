            The <strong>triangular number</strong> function <em>adds</em> all of the whole numbers from 1 through the input number. So <code>triangular number (</code><var>n</var><code>)</code> reports <span class="katex">1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + (n - 1) + n</span>.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/triangular-number-4-reporting.png" alt="triangular number (4) reporting 10" title="triangular number (4) reporting 10" />

        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>factorial</strong> function <em>multiplies</em> all of the whole numbers from 1 through the input number. In other words, <code>(</code><var>n</var><code>) !</code> reports <span class="katex">1 \times 2 \times 3 \times ... \times (n - 1) \times n</span>.<br />

        <p>
            To develop these procedures, you will use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/numbers-from-to.png" alt="numbers from () to ()" title="numbers from () to ()" />to get a list of the numbers to add or multiple and use the <code>combine</code> block to add or multiply them all together. The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/combine.png" alt="combine with() items of ()" title="combine with() items of ()" /> block takes an operation and a list as input and reports the result of combining all the elements in the inputted list using the inputted operation. For example, the expression below reports: <span class="katex">0 + 1 + 2</span>.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine-simple-example.png" alt="combine with (()+()) items of (list {0, 1, 2}) reporting 3" title="combine with (()+()) items of (list {0, 1, 2}) reporting 3" />

                You <em>could</em> develop these procedures <strong>iteratively</strong> (using a loop):<br />

Examples of iteration include using: <code>forever</code>, <code>repeat</code>, <code>repeat until</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>for each</code>.</p>
            <p>
                You <em>could</em> also develop these procedures <strong>recursively</strong> (by using the function inside itself):<br />

                You learned about <em>recursion</em> in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-abstraction/2-fractal-art.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 2 Lab 4 Page 2: Fractal Art">Unit 2 Lab 4 Page 2: Fractal Art</a> when you used <code>nested triangle</code> inside <code>nested triangle</code>:<br />

            </p>
            <p>All of these approaches work, but the code using recursion is shorter and simpler to look at than the iterative version; programmers would call it "more elegant." And your version using the higher order function <code>combine</code> is the most elegant.</p>
