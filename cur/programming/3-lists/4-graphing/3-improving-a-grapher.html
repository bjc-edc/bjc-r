        <h2>Improving Your Graphing App</h2>
        <div class="learn">
        	<strong>On this page</strong>, you'll work with a dataset on a classroom of 27 sixth-graders. You will create a graph of height vs. weight, showing the boys and girls in different colors that also allows you to examine individual datapoints to see their approximate values, like this:<br />

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
            <!--<li>What can you say about this particular class of sixth-graders based on the graph of height vs. weight data you see above?</li>-->
				<li>Load your grapher from before; it should have been saved as "U3L5-GraphingApp."</li>
                <li>
                    Look in the Variables palette for this dataset on a classroom of 27 sixth-graders: <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/Gr6-age-height-weight-gender-stats.png" alt="Gr6-age-height-weight-gender-stats" title="Gr6-age-height-weight-gender-stats" />. Each data point in this set represents a person and contains <em>four</em> items:
					<ul>
                    <img  src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/persondata2.png" height="90" alt="list (137.4)(146.52)(40.52)(F)" title="list (137.4)(146.52)(40.52)(F)"  />
                        <li>age in months</li>
	                    <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
                        <li>height in centimeters</li>
                        <li>weight in kilograms</li>
                        <li>gender</li>
                    </ul>
                    Your grapher was written to expect only <em>two</em> numbers in each datapoint. Will it even work with this dataset? Try it. What does it do?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a selector <code>age</code> which extracts the age of an input person.<br >
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/ageperson.png" height="100" alt="age, person: (person)" title="age, person: (person)"/>
                </li>
                <li>Similarly, create selectors <code>height</code>, <code>weight</code>, <code>gender</code> which extract the height, weight and gender of an input person.</li>
                <li>
                    Now use the above selectors to create custom blocks that report:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>ages</code>&mdash;a list containing only the 27 ages</li>
                        <li><code>heights</code>&mdash;a list containing only the 27 heights</li>
                        <li><code>weights</code>&mdash;a list containing only the 27 weights</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="endnote">For example: you can use the Higher Order Function <code>map</code> together with the selector <code>age</code> to extract a list of ages from the data:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/agesdata.png" height="110" alt="ages, data: (data)" title="ages, data: (data)"/>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<!--Did they?<div class="sidenote">You've built averaging blocks before.</div>-->
                    Create a block that takes a list of numbers as input and reports the <em>average</em> value.
                </li>
                <li>Create a block, <code>female data</code>, using <code>keep</code>, that reports a list containing all the datapoints of only the girls, and another block, <code>male data</code>, that does the same for the boys.</li>
                <li>
                    You now have everything you need to create a graph of height vs. weight, showing the boys and girls in different colors that also allows you to examine individual datapoints to see their approximate values, as shown in the animation above. Build it.<br />
                    <div class="endnote">The following blocks may help you extract the information you need from the data set.<br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/hintblocks.png"  height="100" alt="map () over (); list(height, person:())(weight, person:()); male data, data: (); Gr6 age-height-weight-gender stats" title="map () over (); list(height, person:())(weight, person:()); male data, data: (); Gr6 age-height-weight-gender stats"/>
                </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will need to <code>set graph scale</code> for each of these graphs. Searching through the data to find the lowest and highest values can be a nuisance. Create tools to do that for you.
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/minoflist.png"  height="35" alt="min of list ()" title="min of list ()"/><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/maxoflist.png"  height="35" alt="max of list ()" title="max of list ()"/>
                </li>
                <li>
					<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair.png" alt="Talk with Another Pair" title="Talk with Another Pair" />
                    Use the tools you have built to create a few separate graphs: age against height or weight, height against weight, separated or not separated by genderâ€”and <em>also mark the averages</em> in each case. What can you say about this particular class of sixth-graders based on the data?<br />
                    <div class="takeNote">Collaboration is vital to solving data driven problems because it allows the application of multiple perspectives and skill sets to gain insights and knowledge about data that may not be possible when working alone.</div>
                </li>
                
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <ol type="A">

                    The graph above shows <em>three</em> aspects of each child in the class (height, weight, and gender). Find some suitable way to give some information about the fourth element of the data (age). Pen size is one possibility, but you might find a different way.<br />
