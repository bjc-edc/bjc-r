                <li>1b,c, and d really confused my students, but when they got to 3 they were able to do it pretty easily. I think the naming of the reporter blocks was confusing, and the exploration had unclear goals. If I were to do it again, I would have some exposition about different coordinate systems, introduce the green reporters as translators, and then jump straight to #3.</li>
                <li>I think the PlotPoint at the top of the page is supposed to use go to, not go to scaled point. Otherwise step 4 becomes redundant.</li>
                <li>In #3, where did all the gridlines come from?</li>
                <li>Students get confused in #3 when the variable has a &quot;#&quot; after it, and the variable below it in the block does not</li>

            Plotting a single point, given its two coordinates, should feel this simple:<br />

            <div class="comment">FROM BH:
            5.2.1 error (I think) in yellow side comment.
            It claims that this procedure is state invariant: "Notice that the last block
returns the sprite to its original location. This keeps the block state
transparentâ€”leaving things where they are when you started." But that's not true:

to PlotPoint x: (x) y: (y)
go to scaled point x: (x) y: (y)
pendown
move (1) steps
penup
move (-1) steps

It totally doesn't go back to the sprite's original location! There may be a
good reason to leave the sprite at the desired point rather than one step away,
but state transparency isn't the reason.
</div>
            <div class="comment">It's <em>not</em> state transparent!  That would be if it remembered the point where the sprite was before running this block.  It just leaves the sprite someplace predictable.</div>
            <div class="sidenoteBig">Notice that the last block returns the sprite to its original location. This keeps the block <em>state transparent</em>&mdash;leaving things where they are when you started. You want each procedure to do its thing and otherwise leave things the same so you don't have any surprises. <!--(You saw an example of a bug from a program that was <em>not state transparent</em> in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/4-grids-for-games/1-building-tic-tac-toe.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 1</a>.)- -></div>-->

        <p>Then you could graph a whole list of data points by inventing a block like <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/GraphDatapoints.png" alt="Graph datapoints (pointlist)"> that uses <code>for each</code> to apply <code>PlotPoint</code> to each point in the list. Depending on the kind of graph you want, you could even connect the dots.</p>

        	That seems like all you should need. But what if the <em>scale</em> of your data does not fit on the Snap<em>!</em> stage (between -240 and 240 in the <em>x</em> direction and between -180 and 180 in the <em>y</em> direction)? For example, what if you want to plot the popularity of a baby name over time, like this?<br />
        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/PercentageOfDerekByYear.png" alt="percentage of births named Derek by year" title="percentage of births named Derek by year" />
        </p>
		<p>The <em>x</em>-values can't be plotted because they are completely off of Snap<em>!</em>'s stage. And the <em>y</em>-values 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc., are so close to each other that they would all look the same. We wouldn't see the huge increase in popularity between 1960 and 1980 at all. </p>

                        <li>Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-I-am-dropped.png" alt="When I am dropped"> block with your new script so that when you move the sprite around, it says its <em>graph</em> coordinates wherever it is dropped.</li>

                <li>Then, build <code>PlotPoint</code> so that it uses  <code>go to scaled point</code> instead of plain <code>go to</code>. Check it to make sure it works as you expect it to.</li>

                	Finally, build <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/GraphDatapoints.png" alt="Graph datapoints (pointlist)"> to make a dot at every datapoint, but <em>not</em> to connect the points (for now). Apply it to <code>DerekData1927to2015</code>. Your graph won't be connected and won't have labels, and it will fill the whole stage, but it should otherwise look like the graph above.<br />
