	    <h2>Remembering the Moves and Possible Wins</h2>
		
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>In this lab</strong>, you will continue your <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-abstraction/5-building-tic-tac-toe.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board">Tic-Tac-Toe project</a> to make the program <em>analyze</em> the game board to detect wins and ties.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll prepare by allowing the program to record the moves that are made, and teach it the winning groups of three squares.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            When you first wrote Tic Tac Toe, it was easy to detect illegal moves (moving to a square that's already wearing an X or O costume) because each sprite could test for that without knowing about the rest of the game board. But to detect wins and ties, the program needs a way to test the state of the <em>whole game board</em>, not just one individual piece. So, you'll use a <em>global variable</em>, <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/board.png" alt="board" title="board">, to keep track of whether the square in each position is empty or filled with an X or an O.<br />
            <div class="sidenote">
                <p>You learned about <strong>global variables</strong> on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/1-variables-games/4-keeping-score.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 2 Lab 1 Page 4: Keeping Score with Global Variables">Unit 2 Lab 1 Page 4: Keeping Score with Global Variables</a>.</p>

                <li>
                    Make a global variable called <var>board</var> that, at the beginning of the game, contains a list with the numbers from 1 to 9.<br />

            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>Each sprite needs to know its own position on the board so that you can use the <code>item of</code> block to replace that position with an X or an O. So, you'll create a <em>sprite variable</em>, <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/position-number.png" alt="position number" title="position number" />, and each clone will have its <em>own version</em> of this variable.</p>

        <h3>Storing All the Ways to Win</h3>
		<p>
            To program a way to detect a win, you need to determine what counts as a win.  You'll store each possible winning triple as a list of three position numbers (a <em>triple</em>).  For example, this winning triple could be represented as <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/{3,5,7}.png" alt="list{3, 5, 7}" title="list{3, 5, 7}"> because the win is in the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 7<sup>th</sup> positions:<br />
            <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/winning-combo-357.png" alt="diagonal win bottom left to top right" title="diagonal win bottom left to top right"><br />
        </p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="7">
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
                    <ol>
                        <li>How many winning triples are possible? </li>
                        <li>Write down each of the possible winning triples.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
            You <em>could</em> check for each possible win separately:<br />        
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/silly-check-win.png" alt="is there a win? (Comment: Don't build this!! Just read it.) : if (is there a win at (1) (2) (3) ?) report (true); if (is there a win at (4) (5) (6) ?) report (true); ...; if (is there a win at (3) (5) (7) ?) report (true); report (false)" title="is there a win? (Comment: Don't build this!! Just read it.) : if (is there a win at (1) (2) (3) ?) report (true); if (is there a win at (4) (5) (6) ?) report (true); ...; if (is there a win at (3) (5) (7) ?) report (true); report (false)">  
        </p>
                      
        <p>But that's way too much code, especially because you'll have to do something very similar again, later on, when the computer actually plays against you. Instead, you'll create a list to store all of the possible winning triples so you can check it against the current state of the game stored by <var>board</var>.</p>

                <li>
                    Create a reporter that outputs a list of all possible winning triples. It will look something like this:<br />
