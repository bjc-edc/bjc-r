    	<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe: Detect Tie Games</h2>
        <div class="learn"><strong>In this lab</strong>, you will continue <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-abstraction/4-building-tic-tac-toe.html">the tic-tac-toe project</a> from Unit 2 to allow the program to <em>analyze</em> the game board to detect wins and ties.<br />
        <strong>On this page</strong>, you'll start with ties, because they're easier to find.</div>
<div class="takeNote">In Unit 2, you may have done either or both of two versions of the tic-tac-toe project: the 
<a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-abstraction/4-building-tic-tac-toe.html">one-sprite version</a> in Lab 4 and the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/optional-projects/4-tic-tac-toe.html">nine-sprite version</a> in the optional projects.
<ul><li>In the one-sprite version, it took some calculation to find out which square the player moved into, but very little extra effort to check for illegal moves.</li>
<li>In the nine-sprite version, knowing which square was automatic, because the player moved by clicking a different sprite for each square.  But collecting the moves in one place to detect illegal moves required messages between sprites.</li></ul>
There's no obvious better choice between the two.
<p>Both versions end up with a global variable <var>board</var> whose value is a nine-item list representing the current state of the game board.  As a result, you can now build on either starting point in this lab.</p></div>
<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
                <li>Open your project <strong>U2L4-TicTacToe</strong> (Lab 4 version) or <strong>U2Opt-TicTacToe</strong> (optional project version) and save it as <strong>U3L3-TicTacToe</strong>. That preserves the old version while you modify it here.</li>
                <li>The definition of a tie game is that there are no more empty squares, and neither player has won. You're going to detect wins on the next page, so for now, just declare a tie (switch the sprite's costume to Turtle and have it <code>say</code> &quot;TIE GAME!&quot;) when there are no empty squares after a move.  <a id="hintbutton" onClick="document.getElementById('hintbutton').innerHTML=window.hinttext;">(Don't click unless you really, really need a super big hint.)</a></li>
                <li>Save your project.</li>
