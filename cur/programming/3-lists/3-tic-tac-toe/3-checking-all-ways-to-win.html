        <h2>Checking All the Ways to Win</h2>
        <div class="learn">
        <p>You've built a block to detect the contents of <em>one</em> triple of winning squares. <strong>On this page,</strong> you'll build a <code>status of all winning triples</code> block that reports the contents of <em>all</em> of the triples that potentially be a win and then use that to determine of either player has won.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
        	For example, Player O has won the game below, and the <code>status of all winning triples</code> block contains the status of each triple. The computer can use this block to check for a winning triple that has either all X or all O.<br />

                <li>Use <code>map</code> together with some of the other blocks you have made to build the <code>status of all winning triples</code> block. It should report the status of all of the winning triples as a list of lists, as shown above.</li>

                                <li>What is the function you are performing? That goes in the gray ring.</li>

                            Here, you want to know the status of each winning triple.
