        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you'll check for a tie game, that is, whether there are no more empty squares but neither player has won.</p>

                    Develop a way to determine if the game has tied, and if so, make the program notify the players.

                <li>Play a couple of games to test the tie-checking feature, and fix any bugs.</li>

                <li>Your program can be smarter about detecting ties.  If there is only one empty square on the board, and filling that square with the player whose turn is next wouldn't cause a win, then the game is already tied. The challenge here is that you'll have to test for a win on a board that isn't the current <var>board</var>.</li>
                <li>Instead of just having the sprite say something like "X wins," it would be more satisfying to the players if you draw a thick line through the three squares that generate a win. This is a little tricky because by the time you know there's a win, you no longer know which triple triggered it. Make sure your code stays readable to another programmer.</li>
