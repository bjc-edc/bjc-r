    	<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe: Detect Wins</h2>
        <div class="learn">
        <strong>On this page</strong>, you'll teach the program to detect wins.</div>

			<ol>
                <li>Open your project <strong>U3L3-TicTacToe</strong> if it isn't open already.</li>
                <li> 
                    Each winning combination is a list of three tile numbers (a <em>triple</em>). 
                      <ol>
                        <li>Which triples are winning combinations?</li>
                        <li>How many winning combinations are there? </li>
                        <li>
                            Create a reporter that outputs a list of all possible winning triples. It will look something like this:<br />

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <!--<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /> -->
                <li>Make friends with the <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/map.png" alt="map ( ) over ( )"> block:
                <ol type="a">
                <li>Try these:<br />
<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/map-join-s.png" alt="map (join ( ) (s)) over (list block script Boolean)"><br />
<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/map-3x.png" alt="map ((3) * ( )) over (list 7 8 1)"><br />
<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/map-letter-1.png" alt="map (letter 1 of ( )) over (list bounce join clear)"></li>
<li>Click  <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green flag button" title="green flag button" /> to clear your tic-tac-toe board   and initialize <var>board</var>. Play <em>one</em> game, <em>deliberately letting</em> <strong>x</strong> <em> win</em>. </li>
<li>Try this:<br />
<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/map-item-board.png" alt="map (item ( ) of (board)) over (list 1 2 3)"><br />
<strong>Note</strong> that the first input to <code>item</code> is empty.</li>
<li>What does the result of the above tell you about the state of the game?</li>
<li>If <code>{1, 2, 3}</code> isn't the triple in which <strong>x</strong> won the game, try part (c) again for that winning triple.</li></ol></li>
				<li>Make a block <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/status-of-triple.png" alt="status of triple ( )"> that takes a list like <code>{1, 2, 3}</code> as input and reports a list of which of those squares are occupied by whom.</li>
				<li>Use <code>map</code> and <code>TicTacToe wins</code> to make a block that reports the status of all possible winning triples, as a list of lists.</li>
				<li>Make a block <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/wonQ.png" alt="won? ( )"> that takes the letter <strong>x</strong> or <strong>o</strong> as input, and reports <code>True</code> if and only if that player has won the game. </li>
                <li>Modify your <code>when I am dropped</code> script so that when a player wins the game, the program <em>notifies</em> the players. Be sure to make this test <em>before</em> the test for a tie game.</li>
                <li>Why does it matter about the order of the tests?</li>
                <li>Save your project.</li>
			</ol>
    </div>
            <div class="ifTime">
                <ol start="10">
                    <li>There are many small improvements you could make. For one thing, when a player wins, you might want to prevent any further moves. What else might you want to change or improve?</li>
              </ol>
      </div>

<div class="takeItFurther">
<ol type="A">
<li>Now that you can detect wins, your program can be smarter about detecting ties.  If there is only one empty square on the board, and filling that square with the player whose turn is next wouldn't cause a win, then the game is already tied. The challenge here is that you'll have to test for a win on a board that isn't the current <var>board</var>.</li>
<li>Instead of just having the sprite say &quot;X wins,&quot; it'd be more satisfying to the players if you draw a thick red line through the three squares that generate a win. This is a little tricky because by the time you know there's a win, you no longer know which triple triggered it. Try not to uglify your existing code while solving this problem.</li></ol>
