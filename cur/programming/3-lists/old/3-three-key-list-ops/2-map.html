        <h2>The <code>Map</code> Block (Teacher's Choice)</h2> 
        <div class="todo">
        	<ul>
                <li>For future years: I think these pages are getting too long for one page each. --MF</li>
                <li>For now, there are a few comments to read below. --MF</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 10/30/15: Minor issue, perhaps nitpicky, but I wish one of the list elements used in MAP ROUND were something that got rounded up. A student who is unclear on the difference between ROUND and FLOOR could get confused.</li>

        </div>

        	The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/map.png" alt="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" title="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" /> block takes two inputs: a function (with a blank input slot) and a list, and it reports a new list. In this new list, each item is the result of running an item of the original input list through the function. For example:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/map-example-1.png" alt="map (( )-(1)) over (list (96) (-100) (4.7)) reporting" title="map (( )-(1)) over (list (96) (-100) (4.7)) reporting" /><br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/map-example-2.png" alt="map (join ( ) (s)) over (list (cat) (dog) (bird)) reporting" title="map (join ( ) (s)) over (list (cat) (dog) (bird)) reporting" /><br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/map-example-3.png" alt="map (round ( )) over (list (3.14159) (87) (5.4)) reporting" title="map (round ( )) over (list (3.14159) (87) (5.4)) reporting" /><br />
        </p>
		
		<p>You write the function that describes the change, and <code>map</code> applies that function to each item in the input list and then reports the list of values changed by the function.</p>

    	<div class="takeNote">
            <p>The gray ring in <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/map.png" alt="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" title="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" /> means that the input should be a <i>function</i>. The function can be numeric as in algebra, for example: <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/3x+7.png" alt="(3 * ()) + 7" title="(3 * ()) + 7" /> (as we'll explore later) or <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/x-1.png" alt="() - 1" title="() - 1	" /> (as shown above), but you can also use other operators like <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/join()s.png" alt="join () (s)" title="join () (s)" />: the <code>map</code> function above <code>join</code>s each word with the letter 's'. The blank input slot in the function is filled with each list item to make the new list. In algebraic functions, that's the variable, for instance: that's the <i>x</i> in the function <em>f</em> defined by <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) =3<em>x</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;7.</p>

		<h3>Drawing 3D Shapes</h3>
		<div class="todo">Lab1's last page, draw shape, has lots of numbers, but we're doing something with them.  If we used MAP over the vertices of A to translate it, or dilate it, that would be ok.  I actually thought that was here somewhere, but couldn't find it.  That would require a slightly more complex "getting inside" the list operation, but the kids in their dialogue have already begun that thinking in draw shape.  But when we get to the page on MAP, it applies arbitrary functions to arbitrary numbers for no apparent reason other than exercise.</div>
		<div class="todo">Could you invent a MAP page that builds on draw shape, maybe translating or reflecting or dilating?  You could exchange x and y coords and see what happens.  A translation of, say, (20, 10) could look 3-D ish, especially if corners of the two were connected.  So would a connecting an image and a dilation. --PG</div>

    		<div><span>Betty:</span> That gray ring after the word "map" means a function goes in there. A function? Like in algebra? What about the function <em>f</em> defined by <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) = 3<em>n</em> + 7?</div>
            <div>
            	<span>Morgan:</span> Well, I don't think the function has to be mathematical. We used <code>plural</code> with words. But let's try to put the function <em>f</em> in there. First I need to build <em>f</em>.  Here you go:<br />
            	<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/deff.png" alt="f(n)=3n+7" title="f(n)=3n+7"><br />
            	Then we map <em>f</em> over a list, like 2, 0, and 7:<br />
                <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/fpict.png" alt="f(n)=3n+7" title="f(n)=3n+7"><br />
                and it works!
            </div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> But I think I see an easier way. There's no need to <em>name</em> <em>f</em>. We leave the input in the expression blank, just like we did in <code>join</code>.</div>
