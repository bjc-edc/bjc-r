        <h2>Selection Sort</h2>

        <p>One  commonly used sorting algorithm is called <strong>selection sort</strong>. Here's how it works:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1.</strong> If the input list is empty, there's no work to do.
      <li><div class="sidenote">The earliest item might be the first name in alphabetical order, or the smallest number in a list.</div>
      <strong>Step 2.</strong> In an unsorted list, select the item that should come earliest in the sorted result. (If there are no remaining items, you're done.)</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Find the selected item from  the list and place it in the first position of a new result list to be reported.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Use a selection sort to put the <em>remaining</em> items <em>in order</em> as the rest of the result list.
      
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>(Don't take the word "step" too literally; you'll probably see when you write the code that at least steps 3-4 are in a single <code>report</code> block.)</p>
      <!--
        <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> With the remaining items, select the item that should come next in the sort.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Pull the item out of the list and place it.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5.</strong> Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until there is only one item left.</li> -->
 <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
          <ol>
                <li>Explore the selection sort before writing any code. With your class, stand up and form a line. Then, follow the selection sort process to put everyone in sorted order by month and day of birth (for example, 10/4).</li>
                <li>How is a selection sort an example of recursion? What is the base case?</li>
                <li>Open your project "U3L1-ContactList"; save it as "U3L2-ContactList".
                  <br />
   <strong>We want to sort <var>contact list</var> by name, but we're going to start with a simpler problem: sorting a list of numbers or words</strong>, so that you can use 
<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/lessthan.png" alt="less than"> to compare two items. On the next page you'll modify your program to sort the contact list.</li>

               If you'd like to write the <code>sort</code> block with no help at all, do it now.</span>

            <div id="hint-1" class="collapse">
              To write a <code>sort</code> block in Snap<em>!</em>, you'll need code for a base case, and code that follows the steps of the selection sort.</p>

                    <div class="narrower">
    The <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/lessthan.png" alt="less than"> block will compare words, using alphabetical order, not just numbers.</div>

                <ol start="5">
                  <li>Write the <code>earliest in</code> block. For names, this returns the first name alphabetically in a list:<br>
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/unsortednames.png" alt="Eight names"> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/earliestin.png" alt="Earliest name for alphabetical order"><br>
                    <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#hint-2">This can be done in several ways. Click here for one of them.</a>
                    <div id="hint-2" class="collapse">
                      <ol type="a">
                        <li>Write the <code>min</code> block that takes two inputs and reports whichever is smaller.  (You've done this before, but it's probably quicker to do it again than to find it in some earlier project and import it.) </li>
                        <li>Write the <code>earliest</code> block using <code>combine</code>.</li> </ol> </div>               
                  <li>The selection sort algorithm says to find the smallest item in a list, recursively sort <em>the remaining items</em>, and stick the smallest item in front of the result. Write a block <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/remove.png" alt="remove ( ) from ( )"> that reports a list that's <em>a copy of</em> its second input, but with its first input removed.<br />
                  <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/remove-example.png" alt="remove (what) from (list and she told me what to say) -&gt; {and, she, told, me, to, say}">
<div class="narrower">
          You can do this using <code>keep</code> if you assume that there are no equal items in the list. That's fine for now, although a correct sorting algorithm will keep all duplicate items in the result.<br />
 <span style="background-color: #e4cde3;">You can write a recursive version that removes only the first copy of the word from the list.</span></div>
                    <div class="takeNote">
                      You might be tempted to use the command <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/replace.png" alt="replace item ( ) of ( ) with ( )"> or 
    <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/delete-block.png" alt="delete ( ) from ( )"> in this problem, but your <code>sort</code> block should <em>report a new sorted version</em> of the list, without changing the original list. Sometimes it's okay to modify the original list, but sometimes it isn't, so go for the most generally useful solution.

        <div class="ifTime">
            <ol start="9">
    <li>
                    <a target="_blank" href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/5-big-data/yob2014.txt">This file</a> contains a large list of baby names from 2014. Import the data, then build an algorithm that returns an alphabetical list of all names starting with a given letter:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/biglistnames.png" alt="Alphabetical list of names starting with Z" title="Alphabetical list of names starting with Z" /><br />
      <strong>To import the data:</strong> 
      <ol type="a">
         <li>Make a global variable <var>baby names</var>. 
        Right-click on the variable in the palette to see this menu:<br />
  <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/transient.png" alt="context menu with &quot;transient&quot; checkbox"><br />
        Check the &quot;transient&quot; checkbox in that menu. (This tells Snap<em>!</em> not to save the value of the variable when saving the project, because the value is too big to fit in a saved project.) Leave the watcher on the stage so you can see the effect of each of the following steps.</li>
                    <li>Get the names from the web:<br />
   <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/baby-names-get.png" alt="set (baby names) to (http:// [bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-sorting/yob2014.txt])"><br />
   Here's that text in a form you can copy and paste:<br />
   <pre>bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-sorting/yob2014.txt</pre></li>
                    <li>Turn the multi-line text into a list of lines:<br />
                   <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/baby-names-split.png" alt="set (baby names) to (split (baby names) by (line))"></li>
                    <li>In database terminology, each item of this list is a <strong>record</strong>. Within each record, there are three <strong>fields</strong> separated by commas: name, sex, and the number of babies given that name in 2014. Turn each record into a list of the fields:<br />
              <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/baby-names-map-split.png" alt="set (baby names) to (map (split ( ) by (,)) over (baby names))"><br />
              That's a comma in the second input slot of <code>split</code>.</li>
                    <li>                <img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
 Why is <code>map</code> used in part (d) but not in part (c)?</li>
                    <li>Note: Repeatedly changing the value of a variable with <code>set</code> isn't the most beautiful style, although it's great for explaining the steps. Over time, try to develop the habit of doing this instead:<br />
         <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/baby-names-composition.png" alt="set (baby names) to (map (split ( ) by (,)) over (map (split (http:// [bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-sorting/yob2014.txt] by (line))))">           </li>
                    <li>Now write <code>names starting with</code>.</li>
      </ol></li></ol>
