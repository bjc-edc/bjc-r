                    <strong>Design</strong> (don't code) a <em>recursive</em> algorithm for sorting the names.
                    <ul>
                        <li>First consider your general strategy; how would <em>you</em> sort a group of names, step-by-step.</li>
                        <li>Then consider how you would tell <em>a computer</em>, which is not as smart as you and can only perform specific procedures, how to sort a list.</li>
                        <li>It may help to keep in mind that recursion works by solving a <em>smaller, similar subproblem</em> and using that result to help solve the original problem.</li>
                    </ul>
                    If you get stuck, discuss the problem with another group.
                </li>
                <li>Now <strong>build</strong> your algorithm, as a <code>sort</code> reporter that takes a list as input and outputs a new list of the same elements in alphabetical or numeric order. Test your algorithm using both names and numbers.</li>
                <div class="endnote">
                    Comparing numbers and strings can be done using the same blocks, so your sorting algorithm should work equally well for names and numbers.<br />

<p>There are many different algorithms to sort a list. Sorting algorithms generally give the same result, but the code and efficiency can vary greatly from one algorithm to another. The next  page explores one simple sorting algorithm.</p>

<!--


        <p>There are many different sorting algorithms. But the best one for recursively generated lists, and probably the most elegant, is called <em>mergesort. </em>Here's the idea in a nutshell: Divide the list in half; recursively sort each half; then merge the two sorted sublists. The base case is that an empty list or a one-item list is already sorted.</p>
        <p>The easiest way to divide a list in half turns out to be putting the odd-numbered items in one half and the even-numbered items in the other. You do this with a recursion that skips over an item each time:</p>
        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/odds.png" alt="odd items" /></p>
        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/evenitems.png" alt="even items" /></p>
        <p>All the work here, basically, is done by the <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/bfbf.png" alt="all but first of all but first of" /> in <code>odd numbered items</code>. This skips the second item and makes the recursive call on items 3 through the end of the list. Note that <code>even numbered items</code> is not <em>directly </em>recursive; it calls <code>odd numbered items</code>, not itself.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="4"><li>Why does <code>odd numbered items</code> need two base cases?</li>
                <li>Write a version of <code>even numbered items</code> that calls itself recursively instead of using <code>odd numbered items</code>.</li>
                <li>Can you write a version of <code>odd numbered items</code> that uses (the original) <code>even numbered items</code> instead of calling itself recursively? That program structure (A calls B, B calls A) is called <em><strong>mutual recursion</strong>.</em></li>
            </ol>
