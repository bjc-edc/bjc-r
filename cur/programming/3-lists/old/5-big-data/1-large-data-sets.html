        <h2>Analyzing U.S. Baby Names</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>PG: I have no commitment to the baby names /except/ that it is a good visualization of a complex data set and fairly easy to interpret, an example of something students are likely not to have seen but can learn very quickly to understand. And it's personal (their name might be there) and potentially interesting. The /important/ part, however, is not this context or data set but the many LOs and EKs here, so if we don't use this we need to find something else. The next visualization (global health) is quite beautiful and might be the right substitute, in which case chuck this one.</p>
            <p>BH: I'm not a fan of this lab altogether, and I'd like a chance to rewrite it based on the Berkeley Intro to Data Science course. This page: Not a fan, but it'll do.</p>
            <p>MF: Scrap. We really haven't nailed data, and I hate to suggest dropping more of it, but I don't like this one. It's a klunky visualiztion interface and doesn't really provide access to data; it's more like a "how to read an interactive chart" exercise. And the bullets read like we are just cramming EKs in. It needs to be replaced with something, but it should be something good.</p>

        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong>, you will learn about the visualization of large data sets.</div>
		<p>What about data with millions of pieces of information, instead of a few hundred? Large data sets present challenges and opportunities for discovering new information.</p>

		<p>The Baby Name Voyager is an impressive visualization of a large data set. This data comes from the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html" target="_blank" title="Social Security Administration:Popular Baby Names">Social Security Administration</a>, a text file for each year from 1880 to 2014. Very few of the insights in this data would be learned just from reading these files!</p>

        	Large data sets present unique challenges and opportunities:
            <ul>
                <li>Large data sets can be complex or nearly unmanageable. Storing, processing, and editing large data sets is difficult.</li>
                <li>Because of their size and complexity, large data sets can be difficult to usefully analyze. Computing power is frequently necessary for this analysis, providing access to trends or connections that would otherwise not be seen.</li>
                <li>One way in which computing power can be found for a massive computation is <strong>crowdsourcing</strong>, in which people all over the Internet are asked to volunteer the time that their personal computers would otherwise spend doing nothing, e.g., while the person is asleep.  Examples include <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" title="SETI@Home">SETI @ Home</a> and <a href="https://folding.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" title="Folding@Home">Folding @ Home</a>.</li>
                <li>Some large data sets are built by human collaboration, and can include text, sound, images, and video.<div class="sidenote">Wikipedia, YouTube, and Twitter are all large data sets! Twitter's list of Trends is generated by analyzing this data as people generate it.</div></li>
                <li>Collaborative analysis is very useful when working with large data sets, often resulting in new information that could not be learned by an individual.</li>
                <li>Working with large data sets is often about making <em>connections</em> and identifying <em>trends</em>.</li>
                <li>Large data sets often contain personally identifiable information, such as names, locations, email addresses, and passwords. It can be difficult to work with large data sets while protecting personal privacy.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Visualizations and interactive tools are especially valuable<img class="imageRight" width="40%" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/rundata.png" alt="Running Data in NYC" title="Running Data in NYC" />
 when working with large data sets, giving people the opportunity to study what might otherwise be incomprehensible. This map from <a href="https://vimeo.com/26399542" target="_blank" title="Nike+ City Runs (yesyesno)">YesYesNo</a> was generated from runners contributing their tracking data.</p>
