    	<h2>Listing All The Triples</h2>

        <div>Here's one version of the <code>lookup</code> reporter from the previous page. It uses the higher-order function <code>map</code>:</div>

        <div><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/lookup_reporter.png" class="indent" alt="code for lookup reporter"></div>

        <div>When using <code>map</code>, a new list is built the same size as <code>locations</code>. Each member of the new list is the result of the <code>item</code> block.</div>

        <div>How is this helpful? Now you can pull any set of 3 numbers from the list of 9 numbers, on demand.</div>

        <div>And, you have a handy list of triples you'd like to know about: <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/triples.png" alt="list of triples"></div>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
            	<li> 
                	Write <code>all-triples</code> that takes <code>square</code>, a set of 9 numbers, and reports a list of eight triples, the values in <code>square</code> for each row, column, and diagonal. Remember that <code>triples</code> is a global variable that can be used anywhere.<br />
					<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/all_triples_1.png" style="height:20em;" class="indent" alt="output from all-triples"><br />
            		The output from <code>all-triples</code> can be a little hard to read. It's a list of 8 smaller lists, each with 3 elements.
             	</li>
                <li> Write a description of how you could take this information and determine whether the original 9 numbers form a magic square. </li>

            </ol>
        </div>
