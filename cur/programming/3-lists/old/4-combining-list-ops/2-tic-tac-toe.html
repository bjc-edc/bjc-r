    	<h2>Tic Tac Toe (Teacher's Choice)</h2>
    	<div class="todo">FROM:<a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=MrZG&ProjectName=U0301_ListsPrez">Zeph Grunschlag in NY</a>: "Your goal is to make a much more elegant version of the Tic Tac Toe board drawer that uses functions instead of duplicate blocks. Please notice link to "complicated" program. You don't need to re-drag all the blocks (see the link to a pre-written Snap! program). BONUS: If you can make your program especially short (script blocs + function blocks in total) I'll give you extra credit."</div>
        <div class="todo">From Observation Notes Analysis: U3L4: "We should add a Connect Four project to the curriculum, as an extension / optional project."</div>

		<p><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/5-abstraction/old/3-abstraction-developing-a-board-game.html">In Unit 2</a>, you developed the beginnings of several board games and specialized it to play Tic Tac Toe. Now you'll extend that project to keep track of theTic Tac Toe moves and recognize when someone wins. Later, you'll be able to teach the machine to play, too. </p>

			<ol>
                <li>Open your project <strong>U2L4-TicTacToe</strong> and save it as <strong>U3L4-TicTacToe</strong>. That preserves the old version while you modify it here. Play the game, checking to make sure the sprite <em>centers</em> itself in each cell (tile) before stamping itself, as the animation  shows.</li>
                <li>Players can see which cells  are used but the program doesn't keep track, so players can move  into  cells that are already  taken. Give your program  a variable <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/current-game-variable.png" alt="current game variable" title="current game variable" /> that will become a list of moves. At the start of the game, this list must be initialized empty. </li>
				<li>
                    A <strong>move</strong> lists  the player (<strong>x</strong> or <strong>o</strong>) and the  cell (1 through 9) that the player moved to.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Build a constructor <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/current-move-constructor.png" alt="the move by player: () to cell number: () reporter" title="the move by player: () to cell number: () reporter" /> that takes the two inputs and reports the list of those two. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    You can determine the player from the costume number. Make a reporter <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/justplayer.png" alt="player () reporter" title="player () reporter" /> that translates a costume number (1 or 2) into a player's symbol (<strong>x</strong> or <strong>o</strong>). You can use it like this:<br />
                                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/player(costumeNumber).png" alt="player (costume #) reporting x" title="player (costume #) reporting x" />
                                </li>
                                <li>You can use <code>which cell? </code> to find the cell number.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Build two selectors:
                            <ul>
                                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/player-from-move-selector.png" alt="player from move {} selector" title="player from move {} selector" />  takes a move (a list like <code>{x, 5}</code>) as input and reports only the player (e.g., x).</li>
                                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/cell-number-from-move.png" alt="cell number from move {} selector" title="cell number from move {} selector" />  takes a move as input and reports only the cell number (e.g., 5).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Modify the <code>when I am dropped</code> script so that it adds each move to <code>current game</code>. Start a new game and make three or four moves to make sure that it works.</li>
                <li>When a player tries to move  into a cell, your program must check the list <code>current game</code> to see if that is a free cell. 
               	<ul> <li>Create a <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/legal-move().png" alt="free cell?" title="free cell?" /> predicate that takes a cell number as input and  tests it against <em>every move</em> in <code>current game</code>. The <code>free cell?</code> block should use a higher order function to extract just the cell numbers from <code>current game</code> as a list and find out if that list contains the cell number that was given as input.</li><li> Test <code>free cell?</code> with the numbers of both free and occupied cells.</li></ul></li>
				<li>Now modify the <code>when I am dropped</code> script again so that  a move is allowed only if it's to a free cell.</li>
				<li>Check to make sure your game works the way you want. Save your result.</li>
                
			</ol>
		</div>
        
		<p>The next goal would be to create a way for the <em>program</em> to tell if a player's move has resulted in a win. The following instructions suggest one way, but if you want to experiment and come up with your own method, feel free to do that. Then skip down to the last instruction below.</p>

Play <em>one</em> game, <em>deliberately letting</em> <strong>x</strong> <em> win</em>. </li>
				<li>To  check  for wins, your script will  need to know where the players have moved. Experiment with the following scripts, which report information about the game you just played. In each case, figure out <em>what</em> those results tell you about that game, and figure out <em>how</em> the script generated those results.
