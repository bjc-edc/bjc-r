        <h2>When You Really Have to Loop</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
            <ul>
                <li>JK: Any other suggestions for interesting problems here?</li>
                <ul><li>
                    From Dan in NY: "Some were still working on IsIncreasing(list)&rarr;bool and then getting it to work on one case but it would break another.  [most didn't test whether it worked on (1,2,2)] So I showed two things:<br />
                    1) The DEBUG global list technique, where a null global list is added to each loop by a join() statement that shows the values of iteration variables. E.g.,
                    for each RIGHT in NUMBERS
                       add(join(LEFT," &lt; ",RIGHT,&rarr;,(LEFT &lt; RIGHT))to(DEBUG))
                    …to show them what was happening with the the inner test and the result at each iteration.  That helped them find the source of the problem quickly, and many were able to put a conditional in there to handle the (1,2,2) case.<br />
                    2) A new block we all wrote together (several of the teachers _really_ like it when we work together on something) called Which-Failed(f)on(list-of-inputs)returns(list-of-expected-outputs) that returns a list of pretty-printed testing results.  This was really fun for alll, they got to see an example of walking through three lists at once, with some map and combine examples, I mostly let them drive it with me typing.<br />
                    3) I also showed them another way to write "Increasing" that does use HOFs (even though the curriculum says you can't).<br />
                    2 and 3 are in this file: <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=dan%20garcia&ProjectName=Dans%20Increasing" target="_blank">http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=dan%20garcia&amp;ProjectName=Dans%20Increasing</a>
                </li>
                <li>From Brian:What he's suggesting is to make a global variable DEBUG LOG or something, set it to the empty list, and then inside a FOR EACH ITEM loop you say <code>ADD (JOIN WORDS (item) (some intermediate result) (another one) ...) TO (DEBUG LOG)</code>and you use a stage watcher to see what your program is actually doing at each step.  I'm not sure how or whether to put all that in here.  If anything it should be a page by itself: "Debugging a Loop" or something.</li>
                <li>This content remains to be developed as of Oct 2015. --MF</li></ul>
                <li>4-when <!--page is nearly unreadable without format because there are so many interrupting divs, but I agree with Mary that explaining why some HoF won't help is inaccessible. These are great questions, leading to a good analysis of what map, keep, and combine do.  Maybe these are classroom discussable, but not questions for kids to do in pairs because students are not yet so solid with where these do help that they will be able to feel confident that they can distinguish between things that they don't know how to do with HoFs and things that the HoFs simply won't do.-->  Some version of the dialogue might be helpful. --PG</li>
                <li>
                	GH Feedback 10/16/15: With Simply Scheme, sometimes students were unclear whether it was just the first time a number was encountered that should produce multiple copies of the word.<br />
                	I offer up EXPAND(i 8 3 pancakes 4 breakfast) with output "i 8 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 pancakes pancakes pancakes 4 breakfast breakfast breakfast breakfast" for clarification. Shorter words than these would be better, but the idea is to show multiple numbers and a number-after-number example.

        <h1>I uncommented this to see the backstory. --MF</h1>
        <p>
            Consider the following problem:
        </p>
        <div class="alert quoteGreen">
            <p>
                Write a predicate <code>increasing?</code> that takes a list of numbers as input, and outputs <code>true</code> if the numbers are in increasing order (equal neighbors are okay), or <code>false</code> otherwise.
            </p>
            <p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/hof/increasing-list-true-report.png" alt="increasing of (1 3 4 10) returning true">
              <br />
              <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/hof/increasing-list-false-report.png" alt="increasing of (1 7 4 10) returning false">
            </p>
            <p>(The question mark at the end of the name is a convention for predicates — blocks that answer yes-or-no questions. "Is this list increasing?")</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Because this is a predicate, it's tempting to try to make it use <code>keep</code>:
        </p>
        <img class= "indent" border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/wannabe-increasing.png"
        alt="report <empty? (keep items such that (<() < (???)>) from (list)"
        title="report <empty? (keep items such that (<() < (???)>) from (list)"/>

        <p>
            But <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code> work when each item in a list
            can be considered independently of the others.
            In this problem we have to
            consider each item <b>in relation to</b> the ones that have come before it:
            "<i>Is this number at least as big as the ones we've already seen?</i>"

        </p>
        <p>
            To do this, we need to write a loop.
            The loop needs to go through the lists items, from left to right, and keep track of the last item that
            it saw.
            But, as with <code>map</code>, we don't need to keep track of
            the specific number of where we are in the list (e.g., the third position, the first position, etc.)
            Those index numbers have nothing to do with the problem we're trying to solve.
            The solution is to use the <code>for each item</code> block, this way:
        </p>

        <img class="indent" border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/increasing.png" alt="definition of INCREASING? block" title="definition of INCREASING? block"/>
        <p>
            Like the functions used as input to <code>map</code> and friends,
            the script inside the C-shaped slot of <code>for each item</code>
            interprets empty input slots (in the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>set</code> blocks)
            as placeholders into which an item of the list will be entered.
            <code>For each item</code> promises to go through the list starting with item <code>1</code> and continuing in sequence to the end of the list. We use a script variable <code>minimum</code> to remember the most recent item's value, which is the
            minimum allowable value for the next item. If any item is smaller than that
            remembered value, <code>increasing?</code> reports <code>false</code>.
            If we make it to the end of the list without violating that requirement,
            then <code>increasing?</code> reports <code>true</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the <code>for each item</code> block has the word "item"
            in a round orange block. It's a variable, and you can drag it into the script
            that goes inside the C-slot, instead of using an empty input to
            represent the list item:
        </p>
        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/increasing-item.png" alt="for each using item variable">

                <li>JK: I like the Take it further question, BUT the only solution I was able to come up with uses "add () to list" which falls under the list mutation stuff and has been avoided thus far in the unit.
