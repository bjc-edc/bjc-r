			<p>PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: Now that you're a map, keep and combine expert you're ready to use map, keep, and combine to make a very useful function block: remove pattern. Remove pattern takes a string str and a pattern x and removes the the pattern x everywhere from str. For example. For example if str is the string abracadabra and your removal pattern x is the letter a, then remove pattern(abracadabra, a) = brcdbr.</p>
			<p>
            	Here is some pseudocode to help with this:
<pre>remove pattern( str, x )
script variables: tokens
set tokens to the result of split str using the pattern x 
set tokens to the result of keep tokens with length &gt; 0  {got rid of empty tokens}
report the result of join list on tokens   {join list is the combine based function that you created in problem 6}</pre>

        <h3>Character Encoding</h3>
	<!--	<div class="todo">

        		<li>
                	Character encoding.  Good.  It recalls stuff the kids did earlier (in U2?) but bumps it up a notch.  I'd bump it up one more notch.  Here's a good place to <strong>map adding some number to every number in a list</strong>.  Take an input message, tear it into letter-sized chunks, get the unicode, add 1, reconstitute it as a string.  Do reverse to decode.  Good way also to anticipate something in U4.--PG

                </li>
				<li>
                	In addition to encoding/decoding as an application of map as partial anticipation of U4, I'd also suggest <strong>turning a string into a list of lists containing the characters (or their Unicode) and the order in which they appear in the original message</strong>.  The utility of that won't be apparent now, but is a decent exercise.  It will be useful in U4 (but I would not say that now) for students ever to have tried to do such a thing. Right now, if there's a way to make it more "motivated" and less arbitrary, please do, but I could be satisfied even with just treating it as an exercise. --PG
                    <ul>
                    	<li><strong>PAUL: I did <em>not</em> do this because I couldn't figure out way to make it feel better than arbitrary and this page is all mini-projects (presumably with inherent motivation). Will need to do in U4. --MF</strong></li>

		<p>Every character you type is encoded by the computer as a number. Unicode assigns a number to every letter that can be typed in any language, as well as to special characters, such as !, @, #, &ouml;, &lambda;, &clubs;, and the space bar.</p>
        
        <div class="sidenote">ASCII is a small subset of Unicode that includes letters, numbers, and a few symbols. The list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters#Latin_script" target="_blank">Unicode characters</a> is much longer.</div>

        Mary: The idea of the chart is fine (although it kind of defeats the purpose of FYTD #1) but I think the headings on this chart are confusing.  It's not the characters that are ASCII; it's the numeric code.  Really the columns should be swapped and the headings should be "Character" and "Unicode value."  This also eliminates having to raise the unnecessary confusion of ASCII vs. Unicode. --bh

  Suppose we want the squares of all the items of a list of numbers. That's a straightforward <code>map</code> problem:<br />
<img border="0" title="map (() * ()) over list" alt="map (() * ()) over list" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/mapsq.png"/>

<br /><br />
Now suppose instead that we want to select the odd numbers from a list of numbers. It's a little tricky figuring out how to tell if a number is odd, but apart from that it's a straightforward <code>keep</code> problem:<br />
<img border="0" title="keep items such that <(() mod (2)) = (1)> from list..." alt="keep items such that <(() mod (2)) = (1)> from list..." src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/keepodds.png"/>

<br /><br />
But what if we want the squares of the odd numbers? This is neither a simple <code>map</code> nor a simple <code>keep</code>, but combines aspects of both. And we can solve the problem by using the value reported by the <code>keep</code> as the list input to <code>map</code>:<br />
<img border="0" title="map square over keep odds from list" alt="map square over keep odds from list" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/sq-odds.png"/>

<br />
Don't be confused about which inputs do and don't have rings. It's the square <u>function</u> and the are-you-odd? <u>function</u> that we use as the first input to each higher order function. But, even though <code>keep</code> itself is a function, it's <i>the <u>list</u> reported by <code>keep </code></i>that we're using as the second input to <code>map</code>.

					Each of the smaller lists represents one day's data at the stand:
					<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
                        <li>The first number is the day's high temperature (in Fahrenheit).</li>
                        <li>The second is the number of Popsicles sold.</li>
                        <li>The third number is the number of ice cream cones sold.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Imagine that popsicles sell for $2.75 each and ice cream cones sell for $5.75 each.
