    	<h2>How Searching Works</h2>
    	
        <h3>How do search engines find the information you want?</h3>
        
        <p>There is a lot of information on the Internet, but the information is useless unless you have some way of finding what you're looking for. Imagine if there were no search engines. To find information, you would have to already know where to look. Search engines connect us to information, and they do it quickly.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>In groups of 4, read <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=138" target="_blank"><em>Blown to Bits</em> pages 120-138</a>. Everyone should read "It Matters How It Works" on pages 120-121.<br />
                Then, split the rest of the sections among the group so that at least one person is reading each section.

                	<li>Step 1: Gather Information</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Keep Copies</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Build an Index</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Understand the Query</li>
                    <li>Step 5: Determine Relevance</li>
                    <li>Step 6: Determine Ranking</li>

                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>For each step, discuss in your group how that step works and how it affects what we see when we perform a search.</li>
