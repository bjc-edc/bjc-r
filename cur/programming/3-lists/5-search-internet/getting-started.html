            <ol>
                <li>Open a few search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Search for a phrase, like "internet search engines" or "new york restaurants." Do you get the same search results at each site?</li>
                <li>Discuss with a partner, then share with the class. How do you think a search engine (like Google or Yahoo or Bing) works? What algorithm might the search engine use to decide what to show you?</li>
                <li>In <em>Blown to Bits</em>, the authors claim that "search is a new form of control over information" (p. 111) and "search is power" (p. 145). Why might it be important to think of the social implications behind searching on the Internet?</li>
