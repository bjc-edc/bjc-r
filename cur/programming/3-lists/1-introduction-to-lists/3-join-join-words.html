                <li>PG wrote in an email from NYC PD: "Miscellaneous:  Lists project Lab 1 Sentence Builder needs more scaffold." That's all he said... perhaps he can clarify?<ul><li>Is this better now, Paul? --MF</li></ul></li>
                <li>What kind of support would be needed for ELLs here? --MF</li>

		<p>The <code>join</code> block connects strings of characters given as input without adding spaces, like this: <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/join_elephant.png" alt="join (the) (elephant) (climbs)" title="join (the) (elephant) (climbs)"></p>
        <p>The <code>join words</code> block does the same and adds a space between its inputs, like this: <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/joinwords_elephant.png" alt="join words (the) (elephant) (climbs)" title="join words (the) (elephant) (climbs)"></p>

        <p>On this page, you'll use abstraction to create a "Sentence Builder" project that builds complicated sentences like "the little elephant runs happily around the wise pizza" by joining different parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives, articles, possessive pronouns, adverbs, prepositions, etc. </p>
        
        <div class="takeNote">Recall, abstraction is hiding the complexity of a program by writing procedures to do specific parts of the task (like writing a program to draw one tree and then calling that program multiple times to draw a forest).</div>

				<div class="endnote">There are many posessive pronouns including: "my", "your", "her", "his", "its", "our", "their". (Actually, those are just some possessive adjectives. Other posessive pronouns include "whose" and absolute posessive pronouns like "mine", "yours", and "ours", etc. But those work differently in a sentence.)</div>

                	<div class="sidenote">These phrases will be grammatically correct, but they won't necessarily make sense. For example, <code>noun phrase</code> might generate &quot;a tired pizza.&quot;</div>

                                <li><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/prep_phrase.png" alt="green prepositional phrase reporter block" title="green prepositional phrase reporter block"> should join <em>one</em> preposition with one <code>noun phrase</code> to create phrases like "near the little boy" or "over a wise pizza" </li>
								<div class="takeNote">Use <em>abstraction</em> to build the preposition phrase block. Instead of reporting a preposition and then an article and then an adjective and then a noun, you can just report a preposition together with the <code>noun phrase</code> block you've already built.</div>
                                <li><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/verb_phrase.png" alt="green verb phrase reporter block" title="green verb phrase reporter block"> should join a verb and an adverb to create phrases like "jumps sadly", "naps quickly", or "thinks sleepily."</li>

                        <li>Then, make a reporter <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/complex-sentence.png" alt="green 'complex sentence' reporter block" title="green 'complex sentence' reporter block"> that joins one noun phrase with one prepositional phrase and one verb phrase.</li>

                        <li>Occasionally include people's names instead of a <code>noun phrase</code>. So, instead of something like "my silly elephant", the program could sometimes use "Alfred" or some other names. </li>
