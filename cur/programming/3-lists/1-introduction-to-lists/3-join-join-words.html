    	<h2><code>Join</code> and <code>Join Words</code></h2>
        <div class="todo">
        	<ul>
                <li>PAUL: You wrote in an email from NYC PD: "Miscellaneous:  Lists project Lab 1 Sentence Builder needs more scaffold." Is this better now? --MF</li>
                <li>ALL: What kind of support would be needed for ELLs here? --MF</li>
                <li>BH: This page should be called &quot;Generating Funny English Sentences.&quot; It's not even <em>about</em> Join Words; it's about lists. And the only use of Join is to demonstrate a bug!</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
   
        <p>On this page, you'll use abstraction to create a "Sentence Builder" project that builds complicated sentences like "the little elephant runs happily around the wise pizza" by joining different parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives, articles, possessive pronouns, adverbs, prepositions, etc. </p>
    <div class="todo">BH: I disagree with this sidenote:
		<div class="endnote">This page is designed to clarify English grammar. Look up anything you want to understand better, and use the blue feedback button in the lower right to offer suggestions for improvment.</div>
    The page is designed to give students a fun mini-project in which the use of lists feels natural and empowering.  The less we have to talk about grammar, the better!  It's not clear to me why we have to include the possessives at all.  I've edited the grammar lesson below so that it's at least sensible, but I'm not convinced it contributes to the students' enjoyment of the course.  I think the other grammatical categories are well enough implicitly defined by the sample words in each list; even prepositions can be introduced without comment, given the examples.</div>
		<p>The <code>join</code> block connects strings of characters given as input without adding spaces, like this: <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/join_elephant.png" alt="join (the) (elephant) (climbs)" title="join (the) (elephant) (climbs)"></p>
        <p>The <code>join words</code> block does the same and adds a space between its inputs, like this: <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/joinwords_elephant.png" alt="join words (the) (elephant) (climbs)" title="join words (the) (elephant) (climbs)"></p>

A case could be made for "possessive determiner" but I vote for using the name everyone knows.  By the way, I'd be happier if these and articles were two separate lists -- either that or call the combined list "determiners."</li></ul></div>

              BH: It comes too soon; it's not clear yet what abstraction has to do with anything.  Maybe merge this into the takeNote further down.  "Defining prepositional phrase using noun phrase as a helper is a good example of abstraction..."</div>
                <div class="takeNote">Recall, <strong>abstraction</strong> is hiding the complexity of a program by writing custom procedures (blocks) to do specific parts of a task (like writing a program to draw one tree and then calling that program multiple times to draw a forest).</div>
				<div class="sidenote">These phrases will be grammatically correct, but they won't necessarily make sense. For example, <code>noun phrase</code> might generate &quot;a tired pizza.&quot;</div>

                	If you are <strong>struggling with the English grammar</strong> in this lab, you could: 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Build sentences in another language.</li>
                        <li>Research English grammar for a few days (coders self-teach all the time).</li>
                        <li>Spend more time understanding, running, and improving your <code>simple sentence</code> block.</li>
                        <li>Read (and consider doing) the remaining "For You to Do" and "Take it Further" problems in your <code>simple sentence</code> block).</li>

                    Make three other reporters that report different kinds of phrases:

        <div class="takeItFurther"><a name="further" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
            <p>Create a more flexible sentence builder. Some ideas to try:</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Occasionally include people's names instead of a <code>noun phrase</code>. So, instead of something like "my silly elephant", the program could sometimes use "Alfred" or some other names. </li>
                <li>Noun phrases don't always have to have one adjective. They can have none or two, etc. </li>

                <div class="sidenoteBig">Your old Snap<em>!</em> project should be called "U2Lab1-Plural".</div>
                <li>Use your <code>plural</code> block from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/1-conditionals/4-plurals1.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 2</a> to let your nouns sometimes be plural. Your program will need two separate expressions, one for singular sentences and one for plural ones, since the verb has to match the noun: &quot;the kangaroo jumps&quot; but &quot;the kangaroos jump.&quot;</li>
                <div class="todo">
              Also, in part D, we should think about whether this is the simplest kind of question. Another candidate would be &quot;Who ...?&quot; which just requires changing noun phrase.</div>
                <li>Find a way to create questions. (The sentence could start with a <code>question phrase</code> like "Why does", "Did", "How did", etc.)</li>
                <div class="endnote">You might want to create a <code>question verb phrase </code> block that is a version of <code>verb phrase</code> that reports the question form of the verb (without the "s" as the end). </div>
            </ol>
