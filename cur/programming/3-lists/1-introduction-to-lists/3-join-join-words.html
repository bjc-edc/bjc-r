    	<h2>Modeling Sentence Structures</h2>
        <div class="todo">
        	<ul>
                <li>PAUL: You wrote in an email from NYC PD: "Miscellaneous:  Lists project Lab 1 Sentence Builder needs more scaffold." Is this better now? --MF</li>
                <li>ALL: What kind of support would be needed for ELLs here? --MF</li>
                <li>BH: This page should be called &quot;Generating Funny English Sentences.&quot; It's not even <em>about</em> Join Words; it's about lists. And the only use of Join is to demonstrate a bug!</li>
                <li>PG: I agree with BH. They've seen <strong>join</strong> before, and <strong>join words</strong> is only here as support for the goal of <strong>using lists</strong> in the context of modeling language. </li>
                <li>How is this page title? Or even just "Modeling Sentences"? It was "Modeling the Way We Make Sentences" and before that "<code>Join</code> and <code>Join Words</code>" and before that "Sentence Builder." --MF</li> 
            </ul>
    </div>
   
        <p>On this page, you'll use abstraction to create a "Sentence Builder" project that builds complicated sentences like "the little elephant runs happily around the wise pizza" by joining different parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives, articles, possessive pronouns, adverbs, prepositions, etc. </p>
        <div class="endnote">The examples will be in English. For this kind of exercise, English is less complicated than some other languages, but you may use any language you like.  </div>
    <div class="todo">BH: <!--I disagree with this sidenote:
		<div class="endnote">This page is designed to clarify English grammar. Look up anything you want to understand better, and use the blue feedback button in the lower right to offer suggestions for improvment.</div>
    The page is designed to give students a fun mini-project in which the use of lists feels natural and empowering.  The less we have to talk about grammar, the better!-->  It's not clear to me why we have to include the possessives at all.  I've edited the grammar lesson below so that it's at least sensible, but I'm not convinced it contributes to the students' enjoyment of the course.  I think the other grammatical categories are well enough implicitly defined by the sample words in each list; even prepositions can be introduced without comment, given the examples.</div>
	<p>The <code>join</code> block connects strings of characters given as input without adding spaces, like this: <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/join_elephant.png" alt="join (the) (elephant) (climbs)" title="join (the) (elephant) (climbs)"></p>
        <p>The <code>join words</code> block does the same and adds a space between its inputs, like this: <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/joinwords_elephant.png" alt="join words (the) (elephant) (climbs)" title="join words (the) (elephant) (climbs)"></p>

				<li>
               	  <div class="todo"><ul><li>MARY: Change image and XML to "posessive adjectives" instead of "posessive pronouns.&quot; Images in TOL will need changing too. --MF</li>
                    <li>BH: After slogging my way through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Possessive_determiner" target="new">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Possessive_determiner</a> my instinct that nobody would understand "possessive adjective" is reinforced by expert opinion.  A case could be made for "possessive determiner" but I vote for using the name everyone knows.  By the way, I'd be happier if these and articles were two separate lists -- either that or call the combined list "determiners."</li>
                    <li>PG: Later, when we have time to do this right, the whole thing should be less 19th century. &quot;B runs up a bill&quot; contains a verb &quot;runs up&quot; not a prepositional phrase &quot;up a bill.&quot; Two word nouns like &quot;house boat&quot; and &quot;power adapter&quot; exist, too. These are not adjective-noun combinations. Determiner category is right, and includes &quot;my&quot; and &quot;the&quot; because <em>functionally</em> they are (essentially) the same. Categories should be things, actions, etc., even though those are not quite precise either.  Looser than grammarbook grammar. But later.</li>

            <div><span>Betty:</span> The sentence "the elephant climbs" is just one specific example. Let's build a block that joins any article or possessive pronoun with a noun and a verb.</div>

Create a reporter called <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/simple-sentence.png" alt="green 'simple sentence' reporter block" title="green 'simple sentence' reporter block"> that uses that expression to generate random sentences.</li>
				<div class="sidenote">These phrases will be grammatically correct, but they won't necessarily make sense. For example, <code>noun phrase</code> might generate &quot;a tired pizza.&quot;</div>
                <li>
                    Make three other reporters that report different kinds of phrases:
                    <ol>

                        <div class="takeNote">Defining <code>prepositional phrase</code> using the <code>noun phrase</code> block is a good example of abstraction. If you later change <code>noun phrase</code> to include people's names, <code>prepositional phrase</code> will still work.</div>

                <div class="sidenote"> Use abstraction.</div>

            <p>Create a more flexible sentence builder. Some ideas to try:</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Occasionally include people's names instead of a <code>noun phrase</code>. So, instead of something like "my silly elephant", the program could sometimes use "Alfred" or some other names. </li>
                <li>Noun phrases don't always have to have one adjective. They can have none or two, etc. </li>

                <div class="sidenoteBig">Your old Snap<em>!</em> project should be called "U2Lab1-Plural".</div>
                <li>Use your <code>plural</code> block from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/1-conditionals/4-plurals1.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 2</a> to let your nouns sometimes be plural. Your program will need two separate expressions, one for singular sentences and one for plural ones, since the verb has to match the noun: &quot;the kangaroo jumps&quot; but &quot;the kangaroos jump.&quot;</li>
                <div class="todo">
              Also, in part D, we should think about whether this is the simplest kind of question. Another candidate would be &quot;Who ...?&quot; which just requires changing noun phrase.</div>
                <li>Find a way to create questions. (The sentence could start with a <code>question phrase</code> like "Why does", "Did", "How did", etc.)</li>
                <div class="endnote">You might want to create a <code>question verb phrase </code> block that is a version of <code>verb phrase</code> that reports the question form of the verb (without the "s" as the end). </div>
            </ol>
