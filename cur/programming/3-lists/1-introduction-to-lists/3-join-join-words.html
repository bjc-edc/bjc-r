                <li>PAUL: You wrote in an email from NYC PD: "Miscellaneous:  Lists project Lab 1 Sentence Builder needs more scaffold." Is this better now? --MF</li>

        <p>On this page, you'll use abstraction to create a "Sentence Builder" project that builds complicated sentences like "the little elephant runs happily around the wise pizza" by joining different parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives, articles, possessive pronouns, adverbs, prepositions, etc. </p>
		<div class="sidenote">This page is designed to clarify English grammar. Look up anything you want to understand better, and use the blue feedback button in the lower right to offer suggestions for improvment.</div>
		<p>The <code>join</code> block connects strings of characters given as input without adding spaces, like this: <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/join_elephant.png" alt="join (the) (elephant) (climbs)" title="join (the) (elephant) (climbs)"></p>
        <p>The <code>join words</code> block does the same and adds a space between its inputs, like this: <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/joinwords_elephant.png" alt="join words (the) (elephant) (climbs)" title="join words (the) (elephant) (climbs)"></p>

                <div class="takeNote">Recall, <strong>abstraction</strong> is hiding the complexity of a program by writing custom procedures (blocks) to do specific parts of a task (like writing a program to draw one tree and then calling that program multiple times to draw a forest).</div>
                	<div class="sidenote">These phrases will be grammatically correct, but they won't necessarily make sense. For example, <code>noun phrase</code> might generate &quot;a tired pizza.&quot;</div>
                    	<li>
              				Make three other reporters that report different kinds of phrases:
                            <ol>
                                <li><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/noun_phrase.png" alt="green noun phrase reporter block" title="green noun phrase reporter block"> should join an <var>article, possessive adjective</var> with an <var>adjective</var> and a <var>noun</var> to create phrases like "the little boy", "a green giraffe", or "our old sandwich." </li>
                                <li><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/prep_phrase.png" alt="green prepositional phrase reporter block" title="green prepositional phrase reporter block"> should join <em>one</em> preposition with one <code>noun phrase</code> to create phrases like "near the little boy" or "over a wise pizza" </li>
								<div class="takeNote">The <code>prepositional phrase</code> block should report a <var>preposition</var>, an <var>article</var>, an <var>adjective</var>, and a <var>noun</var>. The abstraction groups the <var>article</var>, the <var>adjective</var>, and the <var>noun</var> into one object: <code>noun phrase</code>.</div>
                                <li><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-mini.png" alt="Save Your Work" title="Save Your Work" /><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/verb_phrase.png" alt="green verb phrase reporter block" title="green verb phrase reporter block"> should join a verb and an adverb to create phrases like "jumps sadly", "naps quickly", or "thinks sleepily."</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <div class="sidenote"> Use abstraction.</div>
                        <li>Then, make a reporter <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/complex-sentence.png" alt="green 'complex sentence' reporter block" title="green 'complex sentence' reporter block"> that joins one noun phrase with one prepositional phrase and one verb phrase.</li>
                <li><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Discuss with your partner how your complex sentence builder demonstrates abstraction.<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" /></li>

        <div class="takeItFurther"><a name="further" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
            <p>Create a more flexible sentence builder. Some ideas to try:</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Occasionally include people's names instead of a <code>noun phrase</code>. So, instead of something like "my silly elephant", the program could sometimes use "Alfred" or some other names. </li>
                <li>Noun phrases don't always have to have one adjective. They can have none or two, etc. </li>

                <div class="sidenoteBig">Your old Snap<em>!</em> project should be called "U2Lab1-Plural".</div>
                <li>Use your <code>plural</code> block from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/1-conditionals/4-plurals1.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 2</a> to let your nouns sometimes be plural. Your program will need to keep track of when it makes a plural noun so that it can fix the verb to agree.</li>

                <li>Find a way to create questions. (The sentence could start with a <code>question phrase</code> like "Why does", "Did", "How did", etc.)</li>
                <div class="endnote">You might want to create a <code>question verb phrase </code> block that is a version of <code>verb phrase</code> that reports the question form of the verb (without the "s" as the end). </div>
