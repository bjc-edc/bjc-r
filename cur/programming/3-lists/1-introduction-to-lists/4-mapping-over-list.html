		<h2>Transforming Every List Item</h2>
        <div class="todo">While working on the SIGCSE paper, Paul and I agreed that this is still a complicated way to introduce <code>map</code> (namely, in the context of ADTs in a project that's already known to be difficult). I think we need a simpler introduction--perhaps in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1il5OFuTDg2tVt3pAocsVH7DKifXHzORjp7cx3odloV4/edit" target="_blank">the Sentence Builder content that will be added to the Gossip lab</a> (e.g., plurals using <code>map</code>). (If we do this, <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-tic-tac-toe/2-find-wins.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">the reference on 3.2.2</a> needs an edit.) --MF, 8/31/18</div>
		
        <div class="learn">
        	<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will use your ADTs with the <code>map</code> block to display all the names in your <var>contact list</var>.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            As you know, the <code>keep</code> block allows you to check every item in a list using a predicate, and it reports only the items that make the predicate true. The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/map.png" alt="map() over ()" title="map() over ()" /> block also lets you work across a whole list at once. <code>Map</code> allows you to perform the same function on every item of a list. <code>Map</code> takes two inputs: a function (a reporter with a blank input slot) and a list, and it reports a new list. Every item in this new list is the result of calling the function with an item from the original list as input. For example:<br />
            <!--<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/map-example-1.png" alt="map (( )-(1)) over (list (96) (-100) (4.7)) reporting" title="map (( )-(1)) over (list (96) (-100) (4.7)) reporting" /><br />-->
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/map-example-2.png" alt="map (join( )(s)) over (list {cat, dog, bird}) reporting {cats, dogs, birds}" title="map (join( )(s)) over (list {cat, dog, bird}) reporting {cats, dogs, birds}" /><br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/map-example-3.png" alt="map (round ( )) over (list{3.14159, 87, 5.4}) reporting {3, 87, 5}" title="map (round ( )) over (list{3.14159, 87, 5.4}) reporting {3, 87, 5}" />
		</p>
		
		<div class="takeNote">
            <p>You write the function that describes the change, and <code>map</code> applies that function to each item in the input list and then reports the list of values reported by the function.</p>
            <p>Notice that the function mapped over the list always has a blank input slot. With both <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> that blank is required. This blank is where the list item goes each time the function is performed.</p>
        </div>

                        Like the <code>keep</code> block, <code>map</code> isn't installed automatically. It has already been added to this project, but in other projects, you'll need to select "Import tools" from the File menu to access the <code>map</code> block. <br />
