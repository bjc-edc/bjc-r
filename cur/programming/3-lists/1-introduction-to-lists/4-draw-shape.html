        <h2>Draw Shape</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
            <ul>
            	<li>From Dan in NY: "They liked the list of lists that drew the letter A, and I had them extend it to handle the middle of the A (that was engaging for most)"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>
        	In the dialogue below, Alphie and 
			Betty experiment by making a list of coordinates for a sprite to make this drawing:<br />
            <img border="2" class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/drawA.gif" alt="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" title="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" />
        </p>
    
        <div class="dialogue"> <a name="seta" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> 
			Let's make a  list of lists that have  have x- and y-coordinates that can be used to draw the letter A.</div>
				<div class="stagedir">Betty clicks "Make a variable", names it "A", and builds: <img  src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/A.png" alt="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" title="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" /></div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> So then we want to go through each of the eight lists and make the sprite go to (item 1, item 2) for each list. Let me try to build it.</div>
				<div class="stagedir">Alphie makes <img  src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/A_attempt.png" alt="script with for i=1 to 8 {glide 1 secs to x:(item 1 of item 1 of A) y:(item 2 of item 1 of A)} then glide to (0, 0)" title="script with for i=1 to 8 {glide 1 secs to x:(item 1 of item 1 of A) y:(item 2 of item 1 of A)} then glide to (0, 0)" /></div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> So when <code>i</code> is 1, the sprite goes to "item 1 of item 1" and "item 2 of item 1". Then <code>i</code> is 2, so the sprite goes to "item 1 of item 2" and "item 2 of item 2". <em>(Pauses.)</em> Instead of using a for loop and counting from 1 to 8, what if we used the <code>for each</code> block? Here's how I would start it. I'm not sure what goes in the blanks after "x" and "y", though.</div>
                <div class="stagedir">Betty makes <img  src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/A_foreach.png" alt="script with for each (item) of (A) {glide 1 secs to x:(blank) y:(blank)} then glide to (0, 0)" title="script with for each (item) of (A) {glide 1 secs to x:(blank) y:(blank)} then glide to (0, 0)" /></div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Hm... Good question. Also, this script isn't quite right. It doesn't connect the first and last points together. And I don't want the pen down as it goes from and to (0, 0).</div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> It would also be nice if we could make this into a general script that draws <em>any</em> shape. Maybe we could make a block called <code>draw shape ()</code>. Then we could also make a list of coordinates for letter B, C, or any other shape, and our block would draw them.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<ol>
            	<li>
                	Finish Betty's script using <code>for each</code>:<br />

        	<div class="stagedir">Gamal has been looking over Betty's shoulder.</div>
            <div>
                <span>Gamal:</span> I think you had trouble finishing that script because those <code>item</code> blocks get confusing. How about if you define a new data type called <code>point</code> that contains an <em>X coordinate</em> and a <em>Y coordinate?</em><br />
                <div class="sidenote">Gamal's idea is called <em><a href="">data abstraction</a>.</em></div>
            </div>
        	<div class="stagedir">
                Gamal has built this block: 
                <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3Lab1DrawShape.xml"><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point.png" alt="point = list" title="point = list"/></a>
            </div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> Those blocks are trivial. They aren't going to make the rest of the program any shorter.</div>
            <div>
            	<span>Gamal:</span> They are going to <em>make it easier to think about</em>. Now, your list of points will obviously be a list of points:<br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/list-of-points.png" alt="letter A as list of points" title="letter A as list of points" />
            </div>
            <div>
            	<span>Alphie:</span> And we could make <em>X coordinate</em> and <em>Y coordinate</em> blocks so my drawing script would have things like
                <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/alphie-adt.png" alt="x coord of item I of A" title="x coord of item I of A" />
            	instead of <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/alphie-no-adt.png" alt="item 1 of item I of A" title="item 1 of item I of A" />, which was confusing.
            </div>
            <div class="stagedir">
                Alphie's two other blocks: <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/xcoord.png" alt="x coordinate = item 1" title="x coordinate = item 1" />

                	Notice that the input slot <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/list_input_slot.png" alt="rectangle with two smaller orange rectangles inside" title="rectangle with two smaller orange rectangles inside" /> shows that a <em>list</em> value is expected.
