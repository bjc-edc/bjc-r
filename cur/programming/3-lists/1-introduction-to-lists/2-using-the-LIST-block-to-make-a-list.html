	<h2> Using the <code>list</code> block to make a list</h2>
	<p>The Variables palette contains blocks about lists. A <strong>list </strong>is a way to combine several values into one grouped value.</p>
<!--**JANE TOOK THIS OUT BECAUSE THEY ALREADY DID AN ENTIRE GETTING STARTED WITH THIS BLOCK**
	<p>The <code>list</code> block is used to create a list:<br>

  </p> -->

	<p> The <code>list</code> block uses a <span class="snap">snap</span> feature you've seen once before, in the <code>join</code> block: a <strong>variadic </strong>input. This means that, even though you see one input slot in the block, you can give it any number of inputs. The left and right arrowheads at the end of the block are used to delete or add input slots.</p>

	<p>Like any reporter block, the <code>list</code> block can be dragged into an input slot of another block.</p>

	<p>The grey rounded rectangle with red rounded rectangles inside it is the visual representation of a list. Each red rectangle is one list item.</p>
