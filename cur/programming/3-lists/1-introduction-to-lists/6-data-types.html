        <p>A <em>data type</em> is a label that specifies what type of data a variable can hold. In some programming languages, there are different data types for numbers than for words&mdash;or even for different kinds of numbers (for instance, integers vs. decimals). In Snap<em>!</em>, there are variables (which each hold one piece of data that can be either a number or text) and lists (which hold multiple pieces of data&mdash;numbers or text). We can also create our own data types to help clarify our code.</p>

        	<div class="stagedir">Gamal joins Betsy and Alphie's <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-introduction-to-lists/5-the-for-each-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">discussion about using a list of coordinates to make a drawing of a letter</a>.</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> I think you had trouble finishing that last script because those <code>item of</code> blocks get confusing with lists inside lists.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Yeah, the expressions like <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item-2-of-item-1-of-A.png" alt="item (2) of (item (1) of (A))" title="item (2) of (item (1) of (A))" /> got confusing fast!</div>
			<div><span>Gamal:</span> Well, we could define a new <em>data type</em> called <code>point</code> that contains an <em>x</em>-coordinate and a <em>y</em>-coordinate.</div>
                <div class="commentBig">This sidenote didn't explain what data abstraction is. Does this addition to it make sense? --MF</div>
                <div class="sidenote">Gamal's idea is called <em>data abstraction</em>, simplifying data by hiding its complexity behind a simpler idea.</div>
        	<div class="stagedir">
                Gamal has built this block: 
                <!-- I don't understand why this is a link. This block is not in that file. --MF <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3Lab1DrawShape.xml">--><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point.png" alt="point = list" title="point = list"/><!--</a>-->
            </div>
			<div class="todo">I replaced this image (above) and removed the link. The <a href="http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-introduction-to-lists/4-draw-shape.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">prior image</a> didn't make sense and the link did not include this block. --MF </div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> That block is trivial. It isn't going to make the rest of the program any shorter.</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> But it is going to make it <em>easier to think about</em>. Now, a list of points will actually look like a list of points:</div>
            <div class="stagedir"><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/list-of-points.png" alt="letter A as list of points" title="letter A as list of points" /></div>
            <div>
            	<span>Betsy:</span> Hmmm... So we could also make <code>X coordinate</code> and <code>Y coordinate</code> blocks so that the drawing script would have things like
                <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/X-coord-of-item-1-of-A.png" alt="X coordinate of item (1) of (A)" title="X coordinate of item (1) of (A)" />
            	instead of <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item-1-of-item-1-of-A.png" alt="item (1) of (item (1) of (A))" title="item (1) of (item (1) of (A))" />, which was confusing too.
            </div>
            <div class="stagedir">
                Betsy's two other blocks: <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/xcoord.png" alt="x coordinate = item 1" title="x coordinate = item 1" />
