	In the dialogue below, Alphie and Betty try to use the word lists to build interesting sentences.</p>
    
    <div class="dialogue">
    	<div><span>Alphie:</span> "the elephant climbs" is just one specific example. Let's build a sentence that joins any article, noun, and verb.</div>
        <div><span>Betty:</span> Like this?</div>

        	<div class="stagedir">Betty clicks and they see <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/joinwords_wholelistsresult.png" alt="all articles nouns verbs joined" title="all articles nouns verbs joined"></div>

        <li>In this problem, you will make a sentence-builder that makes complicated sentences like "the little elephant runs excitedly around the big pizza". To do this, use two levels of abstraction.<div class="comment">Have they talked about abstraction before? Also, are we using &quot;problem&quot; or &quot;exercise&quot;?</div>
   	    <ol>
            	<li>First, use your words to make phrases. Make three operator blocks <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/noun_phrase.png" alt="green noun phrase reporter block" title="noun phrase"> <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/prep_phrase.png" alt="green prepositional phrase reporter block" title="prepositional phrase"> and <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/verb_phrase.png" alt="green verb phrase reporter block" title="verb phrase">. Here are some sample outputs:
                	<ul>
    <div class="sidenote">The phrases won't  make sense necessarily.  For example, "noun phrase" might generate "a sleepy pizza".  </div>                    
                    	<li><code>noun phrase</code>: "the little boy" "a green giraffe"</li>
                        <li><code>prepositional phrase</code>: "near the little boy" "in a wise pizza"</li>
                        <li><code>verb phrase</code>: "jumps sadly" "naps quickly"</li>
          </ul></li>
                <li>Then, make an operator block <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sentence.png" alt="green sentence reporter block" title="sentence block"> that joins these phrases.</li>
            </ol></li>
        <li><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Explain to your partner how this sentence-builder demonstrates <strong>abstraction</strong>.</li>
