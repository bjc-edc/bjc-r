        <h2>List of Lists</h2>
        <p>
        	Lists can contain other lists. Here are three lists: one is a list of world capitals and their countries; one is a list of showtimes on the four screens of a movie theater; and one is a to-do list with categories:<br />
            <div class="sidenote">Lists of lists (i.e. arrays of arrays) are very powerful. If each inner list has the same number of items, you can think of a list of lists like a table of data (or a matrix).</div>

                <li>
                    Experiment with list operations like <code>length of</code> and <code>item () of {}</code> to learn how they treat lists of lists.</li>
                <li>
                    Does this expression report <var>8</var> or <var>16</var>? Make a guess and then build it to check.<br />

            </div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> We could use a list of lists with x- and y-coordinates for each the position of the sprite like this:</div>

            <div><span>Alphie:</span> So then, we want to make the sprite go to (item 1, item 2) for each of the lists in the list. Let me try to build a script to do that.</div>
<div class="comment">Get rid of FOR loop and index variable.  Use FOR EACH right away.</div>

            <div><span>Betty:</span> First, the sprite goes to (200,-20). So when <code>i</code> is 1, the sprite glides to (item 1 of item 1, item 2 of item 1). Then when <code>i</code> is 2, the sprite glides to (item 1 of item 2, item 2 of item 2. And then it goes to the third and fouth points too.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Since these are lists, I wonder if there's a way to use <code>for each</code> instead of <code>for</code>...</div>
