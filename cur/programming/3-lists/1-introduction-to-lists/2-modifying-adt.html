		<h2>Creating the Name ADT</h2>
		<div class="learn">
			<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop an <strong>Abstract Data Types</strong> to store and access <em>name data</em> (like: first-name, last-name, etc.).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Right now, our program uses <em>one</em> text string to hold each contact's name, but people have multiple names.</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> We can just put both names in together.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Well, that's fine for displaying names to the user on the screen, but it would make it hard to <em>sort</em> the contacts by <em>last name</em>.</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> Hmmm... What if we used another list to separate the last name from the first name?</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> OK. So, we could make a <code>name</code> ADT and two new selectors: one to report the name they way it appears for the user: first-name last-name; and one to report the name so we can sort it: last-name comma first-name.</div>
        </div>

				<div class="sidenote">
                    You could paste this text into the "Make a block" window:<br />
                    <code>name, first: %first last: %last</code>
                </div>
                <li>
                    Develop a <code>name</code> constructor. It should accept a <var>first name</var> and <var>last name</var> as input and report the whole name as a list:<br />

                    <div class="sidenote"><code>sorting-form from name: %name</code></div>
                    Create two new selectors to distinguish between the two orders by using <code>join</code>. Test them with your <code>name</code> constructor.<br />

                </li>
                <li>Give the selectors expected input types to make it obvious that they each expect a list (one whole name) as input.</li>

                	<strong>Analyze and Debug.</strong> Betsy and Gamal tried to use their <code>display-form from name</code> block together with their <code>contact</code> constructor. They were their code to report "Anderson, Betsy", but it didn't work. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> What's going wrong? What should they do instead?<br />
