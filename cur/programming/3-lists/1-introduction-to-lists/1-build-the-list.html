		<div class="todo">
            <p><strong>Purpose (do/learn, why this/why here):</strong> Give students a programmatic experience of data as they engage in advanced list manipulations including the higher order function <code>map</code>.</p>

        	<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will develop a Contact List database application like the one on your phone.</p>

                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop an <strong>Abstract Data Type</strong> to store and access <em>contact data</em> (like, name, address, phone number, etc.) including:

                    <li>
                        A <strong>constructor</strong> to <em>create</em> each new contact:<br />

                    <li>
                        Three <strong>selectors</strong> to <em>access</em> specific information for a contact: <br />

        	Brian's Notes from late July 2016:
        	<ul>
            	<li>I'm sad to say that everyone had trouble with my data abstraction stuff in the contact list app (3.2.4).  It's not that they couldn't do the individual steps, really; they just didn't understand how the steps were a story line.  The details that threw people are not understanding the difference between (GET PHONE) and (CONTACT PHONE) -- the first interacts with the user and the second is just a selector for contacts -- partly because the selector doesn't seem to do anything interesting enough to bother making a custom block for.  I think for 2016-17 we just flush that page, although then we have to decide whether what's left (in 3.2.1) is interestingly different from the grocery list app.  For 2017-18 one of you folks, who know how to write curriculum, should fix it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is user feedback here that is commented out.</p>
            <!--<h4><strong>Feedback:</strong></h4>
        	<ul>
				<p><strong>First page</strong></p>
                <li>GH feedback 12/8/15: Make it more like a game so more people will enjoy the site</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 1/15/16: it's unclear what the contact input for the "name (display form)" and "name (sorting form)" blocks should be</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 1/15/16: lab causes a lot of confusion on how to reference items in nested lists, could use some sort of analogy/explanation or graphic or video or something to scaffold this</li>
                <p><strong>Second page</strong></p>
                <li>GH Feedback 10/27/15: I do not understand the instructions on this page at all. This is the first lab all year where I am completely baffled by the instructions.</li>
                <li>Piazza Feedback 10/28/15: I cannot picture what the end product is supposed to look like after completed the part called "Improving Your Contact List App" Does anyone have a final product they could share with me so that I can see what we are shooting for? This is the first lesson I have encountered where I do not understand the instructions. Any help would be appreciated.</li>
                <li>There is too much text on this page. It needs to be cut down. --MF </li>
                <li>GH Feedback 11/30/15: The functionality of contact info is unclear. Does it report all the matching names, first and last, or only an exact match of the first or last name. etc.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 1/5/16: maybe provide a interactive example.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 1/31/16: I don't feel that this page explains the need for constructor and selector blocks very well. I had to read through this several times before I could articulate why this method was not redundancy. If you add complexity to the contact, the constructor block WOULD have to be changed. So would the selector blocks so that they pull the right item from a contact. The only benefit to creating these blocks is if other programs were to use them. Instead of having to change the item number when selecting.... But I don't think you get that from this page....</li>
			</ul>-->
            <p><h3>Here's Mary's June 2017 approach, page-by-page:</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Get a simple ADT set up (already more complex than POINT)</li>
            <li>Create buttons for user to access contact list (including GET blocks not used in U2 and separated by a page from the ADT development)</li>
            <li>Create a SEARCH button by building a simple SELECT script</li>
            <li>Extend the ADT by adding a BIRTHDAY ADT, adapting the CONTACT ADT to accept it, and adding more GET blocks </li>
            <li>Creating a HOW OLD IS block and using it to MAP over the list.</li>
            </ol>
            This goes well above what they do with ADTs in U2 and is my attempt to do everything Brian wants (except typetags, which we agreed to let be optional, and display/sorting form, which I want, but in L2 where it is motivated) and to do it in a way that makes it most accessible both to do and to understand. --MF, 6/19/17
