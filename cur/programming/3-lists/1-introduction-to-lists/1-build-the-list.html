            <!--Brian's Notes from late July 2016:
        	<ul>
            	<li>I'm sad to say that everyone had trouble with my data abstraction stuff in the contact list app (3.2.4).  It's not that they couldn't do the individual steps, really; they just didn't understand how the steps were a story line.  The details that threw people are not understanding the difference between (GET PHONE) and (CONTACT PHONE) -- the first interacts with the user and the second is just a selector for contacts -- partly because the selector doesn't seem to do anything interesting enough to bother making a custom block for.  I think for 2016-17 we just flush that page, although then we have to decide whether what's left (in 3.2.1) is interestingly different from the grocery list app.  For 2017-18 one of you folks, who know how to write curriculum, should fix it.</li>

                <li>GH Feedback 1/15/16: lab causes a lot of confusion on how to reference items in nested lists, could use some sort of analogy/explanation or graphic or video or something to scaffold this</li>

                <li>GH Feedback 10/27/15: I do not understand the instructions on this page at all. This is the first lab all year where I am completely baffled by the instructions.</li>
                <li>Piazza Feedback 10/28/15: I cannot picture what the end product is supposed to look like after completed the part called "Improving Your Contact List App" Does anyone have a final product they could share with me so that I can see what we are shooting for? This is the first lesson I have encountered where I do not understand the instructions. Any help would be appreciated.</li>
                <li>There is too much text on this page. It needs to be cut down. --MF </li>
                <li>GH Feedback 11/30/15: The functionality of contact info is unclear. Does it report all the matching names, first and last, or only an exact match of the first or last name. etc.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 1/5/16: maybe provide a interactive example.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 1/31/16: I don't feel that this page explains the need for constructor and selector blocks very well. I had to read through this several times before I could articulate why this method was not redundancy. If you add complexity to the contact, the constructor block WOULD have to be changed. So would the selector blocks so that they pull the right item from a contact. The only benefit to creating these blocks is if other programs were to use them. Instead of having to change the item number when selecting.... But I don't think you get that from this page....</li>

                	Brian, how's this? I'm making things up... Is this the best place for something like this? I'm not sure that all of this is clear given the contents of this project. --MF, 6/27/18
                    <div class="vocabFullWidth">
                        <p>This project demonstrates a style of programming called <strong>functional programming</strong>. In functional programming, the <em>output of one function is used as the input to another function</em> rather than storing temporary data in a variable.</p>
                        <div class="endnote">
                        There are many reasons to use functional programming: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>It's easier to debug smaller, separate functions than one big one.</li>
                                <li>When you use variables to transfer data around your project, one part of your project might change a variable's value before the data gets where it's going. It's safer to put the output of one function directly into the input of another function.</li>
                                <li>If several parts of your program run <em>concurrently</em> (at the same time), functional programming avoids the chance of things happening in out of order because the outputs of functions that are used as inputs to other functions are always computed before they are used.</li> 
                                <li>It makes your code easier to read.</li>
