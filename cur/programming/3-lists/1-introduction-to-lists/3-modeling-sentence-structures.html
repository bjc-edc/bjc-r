        <p>On this page, you'll use abstraction to create a "Sentence Builder" project that builds complicated sentences like "the little elephant runs happily around the wise pizza" by joining words that represent <em>things</em>, <em>actions</em>, <em>modifiers</em>, and so on.</p>
        <div class="endnote">The examples will be in English. You may use any language you like. For this kind of exercise, English is less complicated than some other languages.  </div>

        	<!--I disagree with this sidenote:
            <div class="endnote">This page is designed to clarify English grammar. Look up anything you want to understand better, and use the blue feedback button in the lower right to offer suggestions for improvment.</div>
        	The page is designed to give students a fun mini-project in which the use of lists feels natural and empowering.  The less we have to talk about grammar, the better!-->  
            It's not clear to me why we have to include the possessives at all.  I've edited the grammar lesson below so that it's at least sensible, but I'm not convinced it contributes to the students' enjoyment of the course.  I think the other grammatical categories are well enough implicitly defined by the sample words in each list; even prepositions can be introduced without comment, given the examples. --BH

        <p>The <code>join words</code> block does the same and adds a space between its inputs, like this: <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/joinwords_elephant.png" alt="join words (the) (elephant) (climbs)" title="join words (the) (elephant) (climbs)"></p>

							<li>MARY: Change image and XML to "posessive adjectives" instead of "posessive pronouns." Images in TOL will need changing too. --MF</li>
                            <li>After slogging my way through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Possessive_determiner" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Possessive_determiner</a> my instinct that nobody would understand "possessive adjective" is reinforced by expert opinion.  A case could be made for "possessive determiner" but I vote for using the name everyone knows.  By the way, I'd be happier if these and articles were two separate lists -- either that or call the combined list "determiners." --BH</li>
                            <li>Later, when we have time to do this right, the whole thing should be less 19th century. "B runs up a bill" contains a verb "runs up" not a prepositional phrase "up a bill." Two word nouns like "house boat" and "power adapter" exist, too. These are not adjective-noun combinations. Determiner category is right, and includes "my" and "the" because <em>functionally</em> they are (essentially) the same. And  phrases (e.g., adverbial prepositional phrase such as "with great excitement") play a functional part-of-speech role. Grammarbook grammar is really not current thinking in either analytic or computational linguistics. Even though the following functional names are not quite precise, maybe the categories should be things, actions, thing modifiers, action modifiers, determiners, and prepositions (the last because there's not a particularly clear functional title except "relational words" which is way too broad). "Things" <em>could</em> be "things and names," but then it all gets more complicated (actions and states, etc.). I'd stay simple and clear, if incomplete. Do this later unless the picture is going to be changed anyway. If it is changed, use functional names, and add at least one multi-word entry to each list that <em>functions</em> as a single element. (Power adaptor, yells at, red-haired, Sally's dad's, with great excitement, in front of.) We can <em>still</em> use "noun phrase" etc., --PG</li>

            <p>Create a more flexible sentence builder. Some ideas to try:</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Occasionally include people's names instead of a <code>noun phrase</code>. So, instead of something like "my silly elephant", the program could sometimes use "Alfred" or some other names. </li>
                <li>Noun phrases don't always have to have one adjective. They can have none, or two, or more. </li>

                <div class="sidenoteBig">Your old Snap<em>!</em> project should be called "U2Lab1-Plural".</div>
                <li>Use your <code>plural</code> block from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/1-conditionals/4-plurals1.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 2</a> to let your nouns sometimes be plural. Your program may need two separate expressions, one for singular sentences and one for plural ones, since the verb has to match the noun: "the kangaroo jumps" but "the kangaroos jump."</li>
                <div class="todo">Also, in part D, we should think about whether this is the simplest kind of question. Another candidate would be "Who ...?" which just requires changing noun phrase. (from Brian??)</div>
                <li>Find a way to create questions. (The sentence could start with a <code>question phrase</code> like "Who,"  "Why does," "Did," or "How did."  Different question words might require different sentence structures.)</li>
                <div class="endnote">You might want to create a <code>question verb phrase </code> block that is a version of <code>verb phrase</code> that reports the  verb without the "s" as the end.
