        <p>Lists are essential to efficient data management. Lists can be counted, added to, removed from, selected from, searched in, and sorted. In this lesson, you will refine your Shopping List App, and you will explore common programming tasks related to lists: indexing, swapping, and sorting.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
                <li>
                    Review your "U3L1-ShoppingList" project from <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-introduction-to-lists/1-shopping-list-app.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Shopping List App</a>:
                    <ol>
						<div class="sidenote"><code>Contains</code> will be helpful here.</div>
                        <li>If you didn't write code for the "Search" button, do it now. Clicking the "Search" button should prompt the user for a search term and then tell the user whether that item is already on the list (but not add the item). If you already wrote code for "Search" button, review your code and either try to improve it or help someone else create their own.</li>			   
						<li>Write a script for the "Delete Item" button that removes an item from the list if you haven't already.</li>
						<li>
                            Try re-writing your "Add Item" script a different way:
                            <ul>
								<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-mini.png" alt="Save Your Work" title="Save Your Work" />
                                <li>either using <code>set</code> and <code>in front of</code></li>
                                <li>or using the <code>add</code> block</li>
                            </ul>
                            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> How do these two methods differ?
						</li>
                        <div class="sidenote"><code>For each</code> and <code>insert</code> will be helpful here.</div>
                        <li>
                            Perhaps you coded your "Add Item" button to check to see if the item you want to add is already on the list so you don't create duplicates. Either way, create a "Clean Up List" button that removes any duplicate items from the list. Here are some instructions:
                            <ol>
								<li>Save this image to your computer: <a href="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/shopping-list-button-clean-up-list.png" target="_blank"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/shopping-list-button-clean-up-list.png" alt="Clean Up List button" title="Clean Up List button" /></a></li>
                                <li>Open and add a new sprite to your U3L1-ShoppingList project, call the sprite "Clean Up", and import the new button image on the Costumes tab for that sprite.</li>
                                <li>Create a reporter <code>uniques</code> that takes a list as input and reports a list of each unique item in the original list.</li>
		                        <div class="endnote">Reporter blocks output (report) information based on the inputs, but they don't change the values stored in the input variable(s).</div>
                                <li>Code the "Clean Up List" button to <code>set</code> the <var>shopping list</var> to a list of the unique items in <var>shopping list</var>.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                    </ol>

		<h3>Using an Index Variable</h3>
        <div class="todo">The content in this section was adapted from a former U3 investigation: <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/investigations/processing-a-sentence.html">Processing a Sentence</a></div>

        <p>Part of what makes lists so powerful is that lists are ordered and each item in the list has an <em>index number</em> that you can use to refer to that particular item. But using an index variable to process a bunch of values is not specific to lists! Creating an index from scratch is farily common in programming and worth getting comfortable with.</p>
        <p>This block says each of the items in a list:<br /><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/index-read-list.png" alt="read through list (list) block definition" title="read through list (list) block definition" /></p>
        <p>The block says all of the letters in a sentence:<br /><a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3L1-IndexVariable.xml"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/index-spell-word.png" alt="spell word (word) block definition" title="spell word (word) block definition" /></a></p>
                    
        <p>Since there is no <code>for each letter</code> block that indexes strings of characters as if they were in a list, we must create an index variable and increase it by 1 (<em>increment</em> it) each time through the loop.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
        	<ol start="2">
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Read through each line of the <code>spell word</code> script above, and discuss how it works.</li>
                <li>
                    Modify <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3L1-IndexVariable.xml">the script above</a> to make the sprite say the following:
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">
                        When writing a script, if you already have a similar script, then you can:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Either duplicate the existing script and modify it for the new functionality</li>
                            <li>Or create a more general script that can be used for both purposes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Every other letter in the word</li>
                        <li>Every third letter</li>
                        <li>All the letters in reverse order</li>
                        <li>A range of letters (for example, letters 4-7) using either a <code>repeat until</code> or a <code>repeat</code> block</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                    <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />

        <h3>Swapping Variable Contents</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
                <li>
                	Another common programming task is swapping the values of two variables or items in a list. So, it's worth building a custom block (or two&mdash;one for variables and one for lists) to get familiar with the idea:
                    <ol>
                    	<li><div class="newProject"><span class="text">"U3L1-Swap"</span><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/new-project-called.png" alt="Create a new project called U3L1-Swap" title="Create a new project called U3L1-Swap" /></div></li>
						<div class="sidenote">A script variable to hold one value aside will be useful here.<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Discuss how you will use it.</div>
                        <li>
                            Write a Variables command block called <code>swap</code> that takes two variables as input and swaps their values. For example, if <var>variable1</var> is <var>100</var> and <var>variable2</var> is <var>200</var>, and these are inputted into <code>swap</code>, <var>variable1</var> should then be <var>200</var> and <var>variable2</var> should be <var>100</var>.<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/swap-var-empty.png" alt="swap () ()" title="swap () ()" /><br />
                        </li>
                        <div class="endnote">Command blocks can change the values stored in the input variable(s), but they do not output (report) anything.</div>
						<li>
                        	Write a Lists command block called <code>swap with</code> that takes two index numbers <em>and a list</em> as input and swaps the two list items with those index numbers. For example, this script swaps the 2nd and 5th items of the list assigned to the variable <var>alphabet</var>:<br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/swap-list-example.png" alt="set (alphabet) to (list () () () () () () ()), swap (2) with (5) in (alphabet)" title="set (alphabet) to (list () () () () () () ()), swap (2) with (5) in (alphabet)" />

                        <li>List <em>commands</em> perform some kind of calculation <em>on</em> a list. They <em>actually change the original list</em> and generally have <em>no output</em>.</li>

        <h3>Sorting a List</h3>
		<p>There are many different algorithms for sorting. Some are more efficient than others. Speed and memory matters a lot more when sorting with larger datasets. A simple sorting algorithm that works well with small datasets is the <em>selection sort</em> method shown right.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p>White is the original list. Yellow is the sorted list. Red is the current minimum. Blue is the current item being compared to the current minimum.</p>
            <p>The double-headed arrow indicates a swap from one place in the list to another. The single-headed arrow indicates that the item that was there did not have to move.</p>

                    Imagine you already have a <code>lowest of items after?</code> predicate that takes an index number and a list as inputs and outputs (reports) the following:
