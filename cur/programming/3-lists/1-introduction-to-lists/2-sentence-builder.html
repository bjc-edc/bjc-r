        	<ul>
            	<li>PG wrote in an email from NYC PD: "Miscellaneous:  Lists project Lab 1 Sentence Builder needs more scaffold." That's all he said... perhaps he can clarify?</li>
                <li>Can we build in something that uses the predicate <code>{} contains ()</code>? Is this a good page to do it? --MF</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Click on the script below to see it in <span class="snap">snap</span><br>
                    <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3Lab1Sentence.xml"> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/wordlists.png" alt="lists of nouns, verbs, etc." title="lists of nouns, verbs, etc." /> </a> <br />
                    Customize the lists by adding your own nouns, verbs, and so on.

        <p>The <code>join words</code> block adds a space between its inputs, like this: <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/joinwords_elephant.png" alt="join words(the elephant climbs)" title="join words(the elephant climbs)"><br>
        In the dialogue below, Alphie and Betty try to use the  lists of words to build interesting sentences.</p>
        
        <div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> "the elephant climbs" is just one specific example. Let's build a sentence that joins any article, noun, and verb.</div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> Like this?</div>
                <div class="stagedir">Betty makes: <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/joinwords_wholelists.png" alt="join words(articles, nouns, verbs)" title="join words(articles, nouns, verbs)"></div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Looks good to me. Click it. What happens?</div>
                <div class="stagedir">Betty clicks and they see <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/joinwords_wholelistsresult.png" alt="all articles nouns verbs joined" title="all articles nouns verbs joined"></div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> Wha...? Oh, these are <em>all</em> the words in the lists. How do we get just one item from each list?</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<div class="sidenote">The phrases won't make sense necessarily. For example, <code>noun phrase</code> might generate "a sleepy pizza".</div>
            <ol start="2">  
                <li>Fix Alphie and Betty's script.</li>
                
                <li>
                	In this problem, you will make a sentence-builder that makes complicated sentences like "the little elephant runs excitedly around the big pizza". To do this, use abstraction:
                	<ol>
                    	<li>
              	First, use your words to make phrases. Make three reporters <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/noun_phrase.png" alt="green noun phrase reporter block" title="green noun phrase reporter block"> <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/prep_phrase.png" alt="green prepositional phrase reporter block" title="green prepositional phrase reporter block"> and <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/verb_phrase.png" alt="green verb phrase reporter block" title="green verb phrase reporter block">. Here are some sample outputs:
                            <ul>
            					<div class="comment">We might need some support here for ELLs. --MF</div>
                                <li><code>noun phrase</code>: "the little boy" "a green giraffe"</li>
								<div class="sidenote">You can use abstraction within this block.  A prepositional phrase is a preposition plus a&nbsp;...</div>
                                <li><code>prepositional phrase</code>: "near the little boy" "in a wise pizza"</li>
                                <li><code>verb phrase</code>: "jumps sadly" "naps quickly"</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Then, make a reporter <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sentence.png" alt="green sentence reporter block" title="green sentence reporter block"> that joins these phrases.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Explain to your partner how this sentence-builder demonstrates abstraction.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    
        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Create an even-more-complicated sentence-builder. Some ideas to try:
                    <ul style="list-style:lower-roman;">
                        <li>Randomly vary the order of the phrases (but only in ways that make grammatical sentences)</li>
                        <li>Occasionally include people's names instead of article-adjective-noun phrases</li>
                        <li>Pandomly vary the number of adjectives that appear in a phrase</li>
                    </ul>
