            	<li>PG wrote in an email from NYC PD: "Miscellaneous:  Lists project Lab 1 Sentence Builder needs more scaffold." That's all he said... perhaps he can clarify?</li>
                <li>Can we build in something that uses the predicate <code>{} contains ()</code>? Is this a good page to do it? --MF</li>

                    Feel free to change these lists to use your own nouns, verbs, and so on.

        <p>The <code>join words</code> block adds a space between its inputs, like this: <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/joinwords_elephant.png" alt="join words(the elephant climbs)" title="join words(the elephant climbs)"></p>
        
        <div class="dialogue">
                <div class="stagedir">Alphie and Betty are trying to use the lists of words to build sentences using the words in the lists.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> "the elephant climbs" is just one specific example. Let's build a sentence that joins any article, noun, and verb.</div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> Like this?</div>
                <div class="stagedir">Betty makes: <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/joinwords_wholelists.png" alt="join words(articles, nouns, verbs)" title="join words(articles, nouns, verbs)"></div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Looks good to me. Click it. What happens?</div>
                <div class="stagedir">Betty clicks and they see <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/joinwords_wholelistsresult.png" alt="all articles nouns verbs joined" title="all articles nouns verbs joined"></div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> Wha...? Oh, these are <em>all</em> the words in the lists. We want to get just one item from each of those lists.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="2">  
                <li>Fix Alphie and Betty's script to that it selects one <em>random</em> item from each of the three lists and puts spaces between the words.</li>
				<div class="todo">What kind of support would be needed for ELLs here? --MF</div>
                <li>
                	Now, make a sentence-builder that builds complicated sentences like "the little elephant runs happily around the wise pizza." To do this, use <em>abstraction</em>:
					<div class="sidenote">These phrases won't necessarily make sense. For example, <code>noun phrase</code> might generate &quot;a tired pizza.&quot;</div>
                    <ol>
                    	<li>
              				First, make three reporters that report different kinds of phrases:
                            <ul>
                                <li><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/noun_phrase.png" alt="green noun phrase reporter block" title="green noun phrase reporter block"> should join <em>one</em> article (or possessive pronoun) with <em>one</em> adjective and <em>one</em> noun to create phrases like "the little boy", "a green giraffe", or "our old sandwich." </li>
                                <li><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/prep_phrase.png" alt="green prepositional phrase reporter block" title="green prepositional phrase reporter block"> should join <em>one</em> preposition with one <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/noun_phrase.png" alt="green noun phrase reporter block" title="green noun phrase reporter block"> to create phrases like "near the little boy" or "over a wise pizza" </li>
								<div class="endnote">You can use <em>abstraction</em> to build the preposition phrase block. Instead of reporting a preposition and then an article and then an adjective and then a noun, you can just report a preposition together with the block you've already built.</div>
                                <li><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/verb_phrase.png" alt="green verb phrase reporter block" title="green verb phrase reporter block"> should join a verb and an adverb to create phrases like "jumps sadly", "naps quickly", or "thinks sleepily."</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Then, make a reporter <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sentence.png" alt="green sentence reporter block" title="green sentence reporter block"> that joins these phrases.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Discuss with your partner how this sentence-builder demonstrates abstraction.</li>
                <li><div class="saveAs"><span class="text">"U3L1-SentenceBuilder"</span><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-this-as.png" alt="Save your work as U3L1-SentenceBuilder" title="Save your work as U3L1-SentenceBuilder" /></div></li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
    
        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Create more flexible sentence-builder. Some ideas to try:
                    <ul style="list-style:lower-roman;">
                        <li>Noun phrases don't always have to have one adjective. They can have none. Or two. </li>
                        <li>Find a way to create questions. The sentence could start with "Why does", "Did", "How", etc. These are called <code>interrogative adverbs</code>. </li>
                        <li>Occasionally include people's names instead of a <code>noun phrase</code>. So, instead of something like "my silly elephant", the program should sometimes use "Alfred" or some other names. </li>
                        <div class="sidenoteBig">Your old Snap<em>!</em> project should be called "U2Lab1-Plural".</div>
                        <li>Use your <code>plural</code> block from <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/1-conditionals/4-plurals1.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 2</a> to let your nouns sometimes be plural. Your program will need to keep track of when it makes a plural noun so that it can fix the verb to agree.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
