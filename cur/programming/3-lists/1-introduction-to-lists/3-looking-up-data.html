		<div class="todo"><strong>Purpose (do/learn; why this/here):</strong> Create a "Find Contact" button that uses a <code>find contacts</code> block to <em>select</em> items from the <var>contact list</var> based on the contact's name. Students get practice with list processing, navigating abstract data types, and using the higher order function, <code>keep</code>. </div>

        <p>As you add more contacts to your list, it will become less and less realistic to find the one you want by reading through the whole list.

Lists, adding and removing items from lists, and searching lists are common features in many programs.</p>

		    <ol type="A">
			    <li>Write a predicate function that takes two contacts
				as inputs.  It should return True if the first contact
				belongs before the second one in a sorted contact list.
				That is, you'll have to extract the names (in sorted form)
				from the two contacts, and then use <code>&lt;</code>
				to compare them.  Respect the data abstractions.</li>
			    <li>Make a block to sort the contact list.  To do
				the actual sorting, you can load the "List utilities"
				library.  It has a block
				<img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/sort-block.png" width="242">.
				Use the contact list as the first input.  The second
				input should be the predicate function you just wrote.
				(Leave its two input slots empty.)  The <code>sort</code>
				block will report a new, sorted contact list.</li>
				<li>Test what you've done so far.</li>

				We've been sloppy so far in talking about name formats.
				Most people in the United States say their given name (the one
				their parents chose for them) first, and their family name
				last.  But in China, for example, the family name comes first.
				So "Sun Yat-sen" is a member of the Sun family.
				<ul><li>How should his name be displayed to the user?</li>
				<li>How should his name look to sort contacts by family name?</li>
				<li>What about someone with a middle name, such as
				Martin Luther King?  Is the middle name a family name or a
				given name?</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
				<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
				Here's the tricky part:  To make this all work correctly, a
				name (as defined by the Name ADT) has to know whether it's a
				given-first name such as Betsy Anderson or a family-first
				name such as Sun Yat-Sen.  <strong>Redefine your Name ADT</strong>
				to make it
				a list of <em>three</em> items.  The first will be either
				<code>given-first</code> or <code>family-first</code>.  This
				first item is called a <em>type tag.</em>  The second will be
				the given name (or names, if there's a middle name), and the
				third will be the family name.</li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
				<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
				<strong>Reading a name:</strong> Find where you ask the user
				for first and last name, and change the code to ask for
				given name(s) and family name.  Also ask which comes first.
				You might want to have two name constructors,
				<code>given-first name from given: family:</code> and
				<code>family-first name from given: family:</code>.</li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
				<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
				<strong>Writing a name:</strong> Modify your
				<code>name (display form) from contact</code> and
				<code>name (sort form) from contact</code> so that they
				check the type tag of the name (the first item) when
				necessary.  Be careful about when to add a comma.</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
				<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
				Make sure your
				<code>find contacts</code> block
				and your sorting of the contact list still work.</li>
