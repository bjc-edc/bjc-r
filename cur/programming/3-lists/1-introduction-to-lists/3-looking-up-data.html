		<div class="todo"><strong>Purpose (do/learn; why this/here):</strong> Create a "Find Contact" button that uses a <code>find contacts</code> block to <em>select</em> items from the <var>contact list</var> based on the contact's name. Students get practice with list processing, navigating abstract data types, and using the higher order function, <code>keep</code>. </div>

        <p>As you add more contacts to your list, it will become less and less realistic to find the one you want by reading through the whole list. So building a search feature will become essential for finding the desired information efficiently. Lists, adding and removing items from lists, and searching lists are common features in many programs.</p>
