        	Some programming languages use the name <strong>array</strong> for their <em>sequence</em> data type. A list (or array) is a set of items that is numbered so you can specify which one you want:<br />
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item-5-of-shoppinglist-reporting-bananas.png" alt="item (5) of (list {apples, bread, yogurt, spinach, bananas, eggs, cucumber, tomatoes, olive oil, almonds}" title="list {apples, bread, yogurt, spinach, bananas, eggs, cucumber, tomatoes, olive oil, almonds}) reporting 'bananas'" /><br />
        The position number of an item in a sequence is called its <strong>index</strong>. </div>

        <p>Many computer apps are essentially <em>lists</em> with tools that search, sort, or manipulate the items on the list. Some examples are contact lists, playlists, calendars of events, locations on a map, reminders, etc. In this lab, youâ€™ll create a simple shopping list app.</p>

                <li>Set the starting value of <var>shopping list</var> to be an empty list. You will need the list block <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/list.png" alt="list block" title="list block">. Use its arrows to get rid of its input slot so that it looks like this: <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/empty-list-block.png"  alt="empty list block">. And use it with <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-()-to-(0).png" alt="set block" title="set block"> to <em>initialize</em> <var>shopping list</var>.</li>
                <li><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-mini.png" alt="Save Your Work" title="Save Your Work" />Write a script for the "Add Item" button so that when that sprite is clicked, it will <code>ask</code> the user for a new item, and then use <code>in front of</code> to make a shopping list extended with the new item, and <code>set</code> to set the variable to the extended list. Make sure it works.</li>
                <li>Write a script for the "Clear List" button that asks for confirmation and then sets the variable back to an empty list.</li>

                <li>Improve the "Add Item" button to add new items only if they are not already on the list. You can use <code>contains</code> to see if an item is already on the list.</li>

                <li>Write a script for the "Delete Item" button that removes an item from the list. </li>
                <li>Think of another improvement and program it.</li>
