                <li>GH Feedback 10/22/15: Much improved page! My concern now is that, in "For You To Do" problem #4, reasonable programmers would prefer INSERT [item] AT 1 OF [list]. The place for [item] IN FRONT OF [list] is when the programmer is doing functional programming, not when using assignment.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 1/4/16: Item 4 on this page ["Write a script for the "Add Item" button..."] is very unclear. Why make it so complicated for the kids? Why not simply use insert at item () of list ()?</li>
                <li>
                    GH Feedback 1/5/16: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students needed to know that the box with the vertical lines requires a list. This is stated on the next page but should be included here.</li>
                        <li>Students need to be reminded (or shown) the "when clicked" hat block to get this going. I'm not sure if it was ever formally introduced in earlier labs.</li>
                        <li>Lastly, you may want to begin this unit by exploring the blocks before asking them to write a program. Something more rudimentary like creating lists and using the index.</li>

        <p>Many computer apps—contact lists, playlists, calendars of events, locations on a map, reminders—involve manipulating <em>lists</em> of information with tools that search, sort, or change the items on the list. In this first activity, you'll create a  Shopping List app.</p>

<div class="endnote">
   	    Some programming languages use the name <strong>array</strong> for their <em>sequence</em> data type. A list (or array) is a set of items, in sequence, so you can specify which one you want:<br />

        The position number of an item in a sequence is called its <strong>index</strong>. </div>
