                        <li>Students needed to know that the box with the vertical lines requires a list. This is stated on the next page but should be included here.<ul><li>I included a new yellow box below. --MF</li></ul></li>
                        <li>Students need to be reminded (or shown) the "when clicked" hat block to get this going. I'm not sure if it was ever formally introduced in earlier labs.<ul><li>I don't think this is the right thing here. --MF</li></ul></li>
                        <li>Lastly, you may want to begin this unit by exploring the blocks before asking them to write a program. Something more rudimentary like creating lists and using the index.<ul><li>This is now addressed in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/1-conditionals/3-first-list-experience.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">U2L1p3</a>.</li></ul></li>

        <p>Many computer apps—contact lists, playlists, calendars of events, locations on a map, reminders—involve manipulating <em>lists</em> of information with tools that search, sort, or change the items on the list. In this first activity, you'll create a  Shopping List app.</p>

                    	<li>GH Feedback 10/22/15: Much improved page! My concern now is that, in "For You To Do" problem #4, reasonable programmers would prefer INSERT [item] AT 1 OF [list]. The place for [item] IN FRONT OF [list] is when the programmer is doing functional programming, not when using assignment.</li>
                        <li>GH Feedback 1/4/16: Item 4 on this page ["Write a script for the "Add Item" button..."] is very unclear. Why make it so complicated for the kids? Why not simply use insert at item () of list ()?</li>
                        <li>GH Feedback 2/22/16: #4 under For You To Do ["Write a script for the "Add Item" button"] still seems misguided to me. INSERT thing AT 1 OF shopping list still seems much more sensible. CONS makes lots of sense in a functional Scheme, but CONS with assignment when there is INSERT already? I don't follow and neither have my students.</li>
