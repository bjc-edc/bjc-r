		<h2>Creating the Name ADT</h2>
		<div class="learn">
			<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop an <strong>Abstract Data Type</strong> to store and access <em>name data</em> (first-name, last-name, etc.).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Right now, our program uses <em>one</em> text string to hold each contact's name, but people have multiple names.</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> We can just put both names in together.</div>
            <div>                <span>Betsy:</span> Let's look at the list on your phone.<br />
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/contacts.png" height="150" alt="list of names" title="list of names"><br />
				Ah, they're sorted by last name, even though it's not the beginning of the name text.
</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> Hmmm... What if we used another list to separate the last name from the first name?</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> OK. So, we could make a <code>name</code> ADT and two new selectors: one to report the name they way it appears for the user: first-name last-name; and one to report the name so we can sort it: last-name comma first-name.</div>
