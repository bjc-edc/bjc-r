	In the dialogue below, Alphie and Betty try to use the word lists to build interesting sentences.</p>
    
    <div class="dialogue">
    	<div><span>Alphie:</span> "the elephant climbs" is just one specific example. Let's build a sentence that joins any article, noun, and verb.</div>
        <div><span>Betty:</span> Like this?</div>
        	<div class="stagedir">Betty makes: <img></div>
        <div><span>Alphie:</span> Looks good to me. Click it. What happens?</div>
        	<div class="stagedir">Betty clicks and they see <img></div>
        <div><span>Betty:</span> What?? Oh, these are <em>all</em> the words in the list. How do we get just one item from each list?</div>

        <li>In this problem, you will make a sentence-builder that makes complicated sentences like "the little elephant runs excitedly around the big pizza". To do this, use two levels of abstraction.
        	<ol>
            	<li>First, use your words to make phrases. Make three separate green operator reporter blocks called "noun phrase", "prepositional phrase", and "verb phrase". Here are some sample outputs:
                	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    	<li><code>noun phrase</code>: "the little boy" "a green giraffe"</li>
                        <li><code>prepositional phrase</code>: "near the little boy" "in a wise pizza"</li>
                        <li><code>verb phrase</code>: "jumps sadly" "naps quickly"</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li>Then, make a green operator reporter block called "sentence" that joins these phrases.</li>
            </ol></li>
    </ol>

        	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            	<li>randomly vary the order of the phrases</li>
                <li>occasionally include people's names instead of article-adjective-noun phrases</li>
                <li>randomly vary the number of adjectives that appear in a phrase</li>
