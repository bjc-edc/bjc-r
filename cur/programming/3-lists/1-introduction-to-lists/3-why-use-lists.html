   <h2>Why use lists?</h2>
   
   <div class="sidenote">Lists of numbers can track grades or represent a sprite's position as a single vector (two-term list) containing the x- and y-position numbers. Lists of words can be family members or an entire dictionary.</div>
   
   <p>What can be in a list? Just about anything. You can even use <em>lists of lists</em> for more complicated data structures:</p>
	<img border="0" class="indent" title="List of the list John and Lennon, the list Paul and McCartney, etc." alt="List of the list John and Lennon, the list Paul and McCartney, etc." src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/Beatles.png" />
    
	<p>When using lists, functions can extract parts of the list, create new data based on the list, or even make changes to the list.</p>

	<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
	<ol>
    	<li>Click on the script below to download a copy that you can import in <span class="snap">snap</span>. (Save the XML file to your computer, open <span class="snap">snap</span>, choose "import" from the file menu, and locate "sentences.xml" on your hard drive.)<br>
        	<a href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/sentences.xml"> <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/wordlists.png" alt="lists of nouns, verbs, etc." style="height:180px;" title="lists of nouns, verbs, etc." /> </a> </li>
<!--<p>You could build up a sentence out of phrases. For example, to make a noun phrase, you want to pick one item from the <code>articles</code> list, one from the <code>adjectives</code> list, and one from the <code>nouns</code> list.-->

		<li>
        <div class="sidenote">List items are numbered from 1. You can enter a number into the first input slot of <code>item</code> or you can click the downward arrow to see two special choices: <code>last</code> for the last item of the list, and <code>any</code> to pick an item at random.</div>
        Use the <code>item</code> block to return the item "pizza" from the "nouns" list.<br><img border="0" class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/itemblock.png" alt="ITEM (n) OF (list)" title="ITEM (n) OF (list)" />
</li>
	</ol>
    </div>

	<p>A rounded input slot indicates that a number is expected. A hexagonal input slot indicates that a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> value is expected. The second input slot in the <code>item</code> block is a rectangle with two orange smaller rectangles inside it. This means that a <i>list</i> value is expected. It's meant to look like what you see when you <code>say</code> a list: a grey (rounded) rectangle with red-orange rectangles for the individual items.</p>
<p>

	<div class="forYouToDo">
    <ol start="3">
    	<div class="sidenote">The <code>join words</code> block adds spaces between strings.</div>
        <li>Predict what the block <code>noun phrase</code> will do.<br>
        	<img border="0" class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/nounphrase-block.png" alt="Noun phrase block, JOIN WORDS of an item from each of ARTICLES, ADJECTIVES, and NOUNS" title="Noun phrase block, JOIN WORDS of an item from each of ARTICLES, ADJECTIVES, and NOUNS" /><br>Then build it and call <code>noun phrase</code> multiple times.</li>
        <li>Create blocks <code>prepositional phrase</code>, <code>verb phrase</code>, and others like it, ending with a <code>sentence</code> block that reports sentences like &quot;the little elephant runs excitedly around the big pizza.&quot; Can you improve on this so that the sentence structure varies, sometimes including people's names instead of article-adjective-noun phrases, or different sentence structures? Post your work when you have something to share!</li>
