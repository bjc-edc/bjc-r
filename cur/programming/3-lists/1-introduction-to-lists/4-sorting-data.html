		<h2>Managing List Data</h2>
		<div class="todo">End L1 with this new lab. Then create a new lab, "Managing Lists of Lists" with the next 4 pages in it: lists of lists, for each, data types, and review/self check.</div>

        <p>Lists are essential to efficient data management. Lists can be counted, added to, removed from, selected from, searched in. </p>
        <p>There are many differnt algorithms to sorting. Speed and memory constrains sorting with larger datasets. And humans generate a lot of data!</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
				<li>Write a list command <code>swap with next</code> that takes one <var>item</var> (index number) and one <var>list</var> as input, and swaps that item in the list with the one after it.</li>
                <div class="sidenote"><code>For each</code> and <code>insert</code> will be helpful here.</div>
                <li>Create a reporter <code>uniques</code> that takes a list as input and reports a list of each unique item in the original list.</li>	
                <li>Look back at your shopping list app. If you didn't write code for the Search button, do it now. If you did, review your code and try to improve it or help someone else.</li>
