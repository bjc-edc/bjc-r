    <li>JK: Another reason not to do map before this is because so far, they've seen examples with join words and map, but that's not what this is.</li>

        <li>In this problem, you will make a sentence-builder that makes complicated sentences like "the little elephant runs excitedly around the big pizza". To do this, use two levels of abstraction.
        	<ol>
            	<li>First, use your words to make phrases. Make three operator blocks <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/noun_phrase.png" alt="green noun phrase reporter block" title="noun phrase"> <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/prep_phrase.png" alt="green prepositional phrase reporter block" title="prepositional phrase"> and <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/verb_phrase.png" alt="green verb phrase reporter block" title="verb phrase">. Here are some sample outputs:
                	<ul>
                    	<li><code>noun phrase</code>: "the little boy" "a green giraffe"</li>
                        <li><code>prepositional phrase</code>: "near the little boy" "in a wise pizza"</li>
                        <li><code>verb phrase</code>: "jumps sadly" "naps quickly"</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li>Then, make an operator block <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sentence.png" alt="green sentence reporter block" title="sentence block"> that joins these phrases.</li>
                <div class="saveAs"><span class="text">"U3Lab1Sentence"</span><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-this-as.png" alt="save your work as U3Lab1Sentence" /></div>
            </ol></li>
        <li><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-to-a-partner.png" alt="Talk to a Partner" />Explain to your partner how this sentence-builder demonstrates <strong>abstraction</strong>.</li>

    	<li>Create an even-more-complicated-sentence-builder. Some ideas to try:
        	<ul>
            	<li>randomly vary the order of the phrases</li>
                <li>occasionally include people's names instead of article-adjective-noun phrases</li>
