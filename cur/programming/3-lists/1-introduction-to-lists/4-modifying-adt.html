		<h2>Modifying the Abstract Data Type</h2>
        <div class="todo"><strong>Purpose (do/learn; why this/here):</strong> Extend the ADT by adding a <code>date</code> ADT, adapting the <code>contact</code> ADT to accept it, and adding more helper blocks.</div>

		<div class="learn">
        	<p>
                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop an abstract data type (ADT) to store and access <em>dates</em>, and you will adapt your contact ADT to use it to store each contact's birthday.<br />

            <p>As we add more complexity to contacts&mdash;birthday, work address, and so on&mdash;the location of each data point (such as the phone number) inside a contact might change. This is where an abstract data type helps. Instead of fixing every block that uses the phone number every time you move the phone number as you refine your contact ADT, you can change just the one <em>selector</em> that chooses the phone number from the list, and all other blocks using that selector will get the data they need.</p>
