        <h2>List of Lists</h2>
        <p>
        	Lists can contain other lists. Here are three lists: one is a list of world capitals and their countries; one is a list of showtimes on the four screens of a movie theater; and one is a to-do list with categories:<br />

                    Experiment with list operations like <code>length of</code> and <code>item () of</code> to learn how they treat lists of lists. Then answer:

            </div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> We could use a list of lists with x- and y-coordinates for each the position of the sprite like this:</div>

            <div><span>Alphie:</span> So then, we want to make the sprite go to (item 1, item 2) for each of the lists in the list. Let me try to build a script to do that.</div>
<div class="comment">Get rid of FOR loop and index variable.  Use FOR EACH right away.</div>

            <div class="sidenote">Why does the sprite go to (200,-20)?</div>            
            <div><span>Betty:</span> First, the sprite goes to (200,-20). So when <code>i</code> is 1, the sprite glides to (item 1 of item 1, item 2 of item 1). Then when <code>i</code> is 2, the sprite glides to (item 1 of item 2, item 2 of item 2. And then it goes to the third and fouth points too.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Since these are lists, I wonder if there's a way to use <code>for each</code> instead of <code>for</code>...</div>
