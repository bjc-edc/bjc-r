                            You'll want to ask the user for each piece of data (contact name, address, and phone number) separately.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                	<strong>You <em>could</em> use several <code>ask</code> and <code>answer</code> blocks together with script variables</strong> to request and then store each piece of user input until you are ready to report them all together using <code>contact</code>.<br />

                                    <strong><em>Another way</em> is to use <em>abstraction</em>: create helper blocks</strong> (such as <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-name.png" alt="get name" title="get name" /> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-phone.png" alt="get phone" title="get phone" />) that each ask the user for one piece of data and report their answer to the <code>contact</code> constructor.<br />

                                I pulled this because it feels too unnecessary; they can do it if they want to, but "abstraction for the sake of abstraction" is not what we are teaching. --MF, 6/5/17

                        <ul>
                            <li>One way to add an item to a list is with <code>add</code>.</li>

                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>Add a few made-up people to your <var>contact list</var> to make sure everything works.</li>
                <li>
                    Write a script for the "Clear List" button to reset <var>contact list</var> to an empty list. 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Give the sprite an appropriate costume.</li>
                        <li>Make the script ask the user for confirmation (so no one accidentally deletes their lists).</li>
                        <div class="endnote">For example, clicking, "Clear List" might <code>ask</code> the user, "Enter c to clear the list, or enter anything else to cancel."</div>

				<li>The sprites' questions might be covered up by the <var>contact list</var> watcher on the stage. Use <code>hide variable</code> and <code>show variable</code> to hide the <var>contact list</var> watcher until the end of each sprite's script.</li>
