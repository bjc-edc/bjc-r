                        <p>
                            You'll want to ask the user for each piece of data (contact name, address, and phone number) separately.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                	<strong>You <em>could</em> use several <code>ask</code> and <code>answer</code> blocks together with script variables</strong> to request and then store each piece of user input until you are ready to report them all together using <code>contact</code>.<br />

                                    <strong><em>Another way</em> is to use <em>abstraction</em>: create helper blocks</strong> (such as <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-name.png" alt="get name" title="get name" /> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-phone.png" alt="get phone" title="get phone" />) that each ask the user for one piece of data and report their answer to the <code>contact</code> constructor.<br />

								<p>You might choose to first build a more general <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-answer-to-question.png" alt="get answer to question ()" title="get answer to question ()" /> helper block (yet another abstraction) to use inside the other helper blocks instead of rewriting the <code>ask</code> and <code>answer</code> script  multiple times.</p>
