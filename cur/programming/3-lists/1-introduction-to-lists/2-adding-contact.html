                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop:

                    <li>An <strong>"Add Contact" button</strong> for adding each new contact using the <code>contact</code> constructor</li>
                    <li>A <strong>"Clear List" button</strong> for emptying the <var>contact list</var> while debugging</li>

						<li>Give the sprite an appropriate costume; several are included in the project.</li>
                        <li>First, make the clicking "Add Contact" sprite add a blank contact to the <var>contact list</var> using the <code>contact</code> constructor.</li>
                        <li>Once that's working, fill those blanks with contact data collected from the user.</li>

                        <h4><strong>Collecting Data from the User</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                            You'll want to ask the user for each piece of data (contact name, address, and phone number) separately.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                	<strong>You <em>could</em> use several <code>ask</code> and <code>answer</code> blocks together with script variables</strong> to request and then store each piece of user input until you are ready to report them all together using <code>contact</code>.<br />
                                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/contact-constructor-with-variables.png" alt="contact with name: (name) address: (address) phone: (phone)" title="contact with name: (name) address: (address) phone: (phone)" />
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong><em>Another way</em> that makes for cleaner code is to use <em>abstraction</em>: create helper blocks</strong> (such as <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/ask-name.png" alt="ask name" title="ask name" /> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/ask-phone.png" alt="ask phone" title="ask phone" />) that each ask the user for one piece of data and report their answer to the <code>contact</code> constructor.<br />
                                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/contact-constructor-with-helpers.png" alt="contact with name: (ask name) address: (ask address) phone: (ask phone)" title="contact with name: (ask name) address: (ask address) phone: (ask phone)" /><br />
                                    Each of these helper blocks will <code>ask</code> the user a specific question (like, "What is the contact's address?") and then report the user's <code>answer</code>.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <div class="endnote">
								<p>You could first build a more general <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/answer-to-prompt.png" alt="answer to prompt ()" title="answer to prompt ()" /> helper block (yet another abstraction) to use in the other helper blocks instead of rewriting the <code>ask</code> and <code>answer</code> script every time.</p>
                            </div>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <ol start="4">
		                <li>Add a few made-up people to your <var>contact list</var> to make sure everything works.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <div class="todo">
                        <p>I dropped <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-new-contact.png" alt="get new contact"> because I think it complicates the situation with unnecessary abstraction. If students want to built that, they can, but I don't think it valuable to distract them with it deliberately. --MF, 6/3/17</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="endnote">
                    For now, the names and addresses will be single text strings (like, "Alphie Preston" or "149 E. 16th Ave. Sunnyvale, MA"). Soon, you can also create abstract data types for names and addresses so that they can be stored as lists inside the contact ADT, like this:<br/>
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/" alt="" title="" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/" alt="" title="" />
                </div>
                <li>
                    Develop a "Clear List" button that resets the <var>contact list</var> to an empty list. 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Give the sprite an appropriate costume.</li>
                        <li>Make the script ask the user for confirmation (so the user won't accidentally delete their list).</li>
                        <div class="endnote">For example, clicking, "Clear List" might <code>ask</code> the user, "Enter c to clear the list, or enter anything else to cancel."</div>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />
            </ol>
        </div>

		<div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>The sprites' questions might be covered up by the <var>contact list</var> watcher on the stage. Use <code>hide variable</code> and <code>show variable</code> to hide the <var>contact list</var> watcher until the end of each sprite's script.</li>
