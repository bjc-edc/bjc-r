   <h2>List of Lists</h2>
      
   <p>Lists can be items inside larger lists. Here's a list of world capitals, a list of showtimes on the four screens of a movie theater, and a to-do list.<br>

        <li>Experiment with list operations like <code>length of</code> and <code>item () of</code> to learn how they treat lists of lists. Then answer:

	<p>In the dialogue below, Alphie and Betty experiment by making a list of coordinates for a sprite to make this drawing:<br><img border="2" class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/draw_list_coordinates.gif" alt="sprite drawing by going to each set of coordinates" title="sprite drawing by going to each set of coordinates"></p>
     <div class="comment">  AC:  This is just a test to see if I can make an animatiopn work.  Thanks, Paul.</div>

    <div class="dialogue">
        <div><span>Betty:</span> Our list of lists could have x- and y-coordinates for the position of a sprite, like this.</div>
        	<div class="stagedir">Betty makes: <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinates.png" alt="coordinates list ((50,120), (-20,40), etc)" title="coordinates list ((50,120), (-20,40), etc)"></div>

        <div><span>Alphie:</span> So then we want to go through each of the four lists and make the sprite go to (item 1, item 2) for each list. Let me try to build it.</div>
        	<div class="stagedir">Alphie makes <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinates_for.png" alt="script with for loop" title="script with for loop"></div>
        <div><span>Betty:</span> So when <code>i</code> is 1, the sprite goes to "item 1 of item 1" and "item 2 of item 1". Then <code>i</code> is 2, so the sprite goes to "item 1 of item 2" and "item 2 of item 2".</div>
        <div><span>Alphie:</span> I wonder if there's a way to use <code>for each</code> here instead?</div>
