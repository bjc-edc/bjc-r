		<div class="todo"><strong>Purpose (do/learn; why this/here):</strong> Create a "Find Contact" button that uses a <code>find contacts</code> block to <em>select</em> items from the <var>contact list</var> based on the contact's name. Students get practice with list processing, navigating abstract data types, and using the higher order function, <code>keep</code>. </div>
