<!--        <p>A <strong>data type</strong> is a label that specifies what type of data a variable can hold. In some programming languages, there are different data types for numbers than for words&mdash;or even for different kinds of numbers (for instance, integers vs. decimals). In Snap<em>!</em>, there are variables (which each hold one piece of data that can be either a number or text) and lists (which hold multiple pieces of data&mdash;numbers or text). We can also create our own data types to help clarify our code.</p>  -->

		<p>A <strong>data type</strong> is, just as the name suggests, what <em>kind</em> of data something is.</p>
		<p>Each programming language provides some <strong>primitive</strong> (built in) <strong>data types</strong>.  The primitive types in Snap<em>!</em> are <em>number</em>, <em>text string</em>, <em>Boolean</em>, <em>list</em>, <em>command</em>, <em>reporter</em>, and <em>predicate</em> (but we haven't used the last three as data types yet).  You can get a reminder of Snap<em>!</em>'s primitive types from the pull-down menu of the <code>is () a ()?</code> block (shown right).</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Abstract data types</strong> (or ADTs) such as "noun phrase" are custom data types that exist only in the mind of the programmer. For example: 
<ul>
                <li>Your reporter <code>noun phrase</code> (in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-introduction-to-lists/3-modeling-sentence-structures.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Lab 1</a>) constructs a data type  that joins three text strings from various lists.</li>
                <li>Similarly, <code>prepositional phrase</code> constructs a data type made out of a preposition and a noun phrase.</li>
                <li>If you were collecting data on your classmates for a yearbook, you might want a <code>student</code> constructor.</li>
                <li>For your Contacts List app, you will create a <code>contact</code> data type.</li>
                <li>On this page, you will use a <code>point</code> constructor to simplify your Draw Shape project.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        	<div class="stagedir">Gamal joins Betsy and Alphie's <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-nesting-lists/2-the-for-each-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">discussion about using a list of coordinates to make a drawing of a letter</a>.</div>
            <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/drawA.gif" alt="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" title="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" />
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> I think you had trouble finishing that last script because those <code>item of</code> blocks get confusing with lists inside lists.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Yeah, the expressions like <img style="padding: 0px;" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item-2-of-item-1-of-A.png" alt="item (2) of (item (1) of (A))" title="item (2) of (item (1) of (A))" /> get confusing fast!</div>
			<div><span>Gamal:</span> Well, we could define a new <em>data type</em> called <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point()().png" alt="point () ()" title="point () ()" /> that contains an <em>x</em>-coordinate and a <em>y</em>-coordinate.</div>
			<div class="sidenote">Gamal's idea is called <strong>data abstraction</strong>: creating a new abstract data type so that the detailed representation of the type is hidden from its users. In this case, users of points don't have to know that they're represented as lists.</div>
        	<div class="stagedir">
                Gamal has built this block: 
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point.png" alt="point = list" title="point = list"/>
            </div>
			<div><span>Betsy:</span> That block is trivial; it isn't going to make the rest of the program any shorter. <code>Point</code> does the same thing as <code>list</code>!</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> But it is going to make it <em>easier to think about</em>. Now, a list of points will actually look like a list of points:</div>
            <div class="stagedir"><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/list-of-points.png" alt="letter A as list of points" title="letter A as list of points" /></div>
            <div class="endnote">Gamal's <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point()().png" alt="point () ()" title="point () ()" /> block is called the <strong>constructor</strong> for the <code>point</code> abstract data type because it <em>constructs</em> (and reports) the list of assigned inputs (in this case, the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates for a point).</div>
            <div>
            	<span>Betsy:</span> Hmmm... So we could also make <code>X coordinate</code> and <code>Y coordinate</code> blocks so that the drawing script would have things like <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/X-coord-of-item-1-of-A.png" alt="X coordinate of item (1) of (A)" title="X coordinate of item (1) of (A)" /> instead of <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item-1-of-item-1-of-A.png" alt="item (1) of (item (1) of (A))" title="item (1) of (item (1) of (A))" />, which was confusing too.
