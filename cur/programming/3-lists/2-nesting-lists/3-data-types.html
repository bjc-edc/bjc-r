        <h2>Data Types</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
            <ul>
                <li>Paul or Brian, please review the following preface on data types. --MF
                	<ul>
                    	<li>Variables do not have types. <em>Data</em> have types. Any variable can hold any datum, regardless of type. Also, Snap<em>!</em> is not Scratch -- lists are not comparable to variables; they're comparable to numbers or procedures. --BH</li>
						<li>Brian, Please make changes here and in the TG regarding constructors and selectors vs. datatypes. --MF</li>
                    </ul>

<!--        <p>A <strong>data type</strong> is a label that specifies what type of data a variable can hold. In some programming languages, there are different data types for numbers than for words&mdash;or even for different kinds of numbers (for instance, integers vs. decimals). In Snap<em>!</em>, there are variables (which each hold one piece of data that can be either a number or text) and lists (which hold multiple pieces of data&mdash;numbers or text). We can also create our own data types to help clarify our code.</p>  -->

		<p>A <strong>data type</strong> is, just as the name suggests, what <em>kind</em> of data something is.</p>
		<p>Each programming language provides some &quot;primitive&quot; data types.  The <strong>primitive</strong> types in Snap<em>!</em> are <em>number</em>, <em>text string</em>, <em>Boolean</em>, <em>list</em>, <em>command</em>, <em>reporter</em>, and <em>predicate</em> (but we haven't used the last three as data types yet.)  You can get a reminder of Snap<em>!</em>'s primitive types from the pulldown menu in the <code>is () a ()?</code> block.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Abstract data types</strong> (or ADTs), like &quot;noun phrase&quot; exist only in the mind of the programmer. For example: 
<ul>
                <li>Your reporter <var>noun phrase</var> (in <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-introduction-to-lists/3-join-join-words.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Lab 1</a>) was a data type  that joined 3 text strings from various lists.</li>
                <li>Also <var>prepositional phrase</var> (in <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-introduction-to-lists/3-join-join-words.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Lab 1</a>) was a data type that joined a text string and a <var>noun phrase</var>.</li>
                <li>You could create a <var>person</var> data type for your Contacts List app.</li>
                <li>You might want a <var>student</var> data type if you were collecting data on your classmates for a yearbook. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            I believe this was Paul's work that crashed into my work on this page. I did not reintegrate since I've already updated the above. Paul, if you want to keep any of this, please reintegrate whatever is most important. --MF
            <p>Data types such as &quot;Noun phrase&quot; or &quot;person&quot; exist only in the mind of the programmer. These are abstractions, created by the programmer, so they are called &quot;abstract&quot; data types. Each programming language provides some &quot;primitive&quot; data types.  The primitive types in Snap<em>!</em> are number, text string, Boolean, list, command, reporter, and predicate.  (We haven't used the last three as data types yet.)

            <div><span>Gamal:</span> I think you had trouble finishing that last script because those <code>item of</code> blocks get confusing with lists inside lists.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Yeah, the expressions like <img style="padding: 0px;" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item-2-of-item-1-of-A.png" alt="item (2) of (item (1) of (A))" title="item (2) of (item (1) of (A))" /> get confusing fast!</div>
			<div><span>Gamal:</span> Well, we could define a new <em>data type</em> called <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point()().png" alt="point () ()" title="point () ()" /> that contains an <em>x</em>-coordinate and a <em>y</em>-coordinate.</div>
                <div class="sidenote">Gamal's idea is called <strong>data abstraction</strong>: creating a new abstract data type so that the detailed representation of the type is hidden from its users. In this case, users of points don't have to know that they're represented as lists.</div>
        	<div class="stagedir">
                Gamal has built this block: 
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point.png" alt="point = list" title="point = list"/>

                <ul>
                    <li>"Didn't make sense"?  The number signs are there because Gamal has declared his inputs to be of type number.  <!--And we're supposed to make block definition pictures with "Plain prototype labels" turned on.--> --BH</li>
                    <li>Have we introduced number-type inputs? I don't recall having seen them... Do you have concerns with the new image?--MF</li>
                    <li>PG: Yes, input types, including number, were introduced in U2.</li>
                </ul>
            </li></ul></div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> That block is trivial; it isn't going to make the rest of the program any shorter.</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> But it is going to make it <em>easier to think about</em>. Now, a list of points will actually look like a list of points:</div>
            <div class="stagedir"><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/list-of-points.png" alt="letter A as list of points" title="letter A as list of points" /></div>
            <div>
            	<span>Betsy:</span> Hmmm... So we could also make <code>X coordinate</code> and <code>Y coordinate</code> blocks so that the drawing script would have things like <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/X-coord-of-item-1-of-A.png" alt="X coordinate of item (1) of (A)" title="X coordinate of item (1) of (A)" /> instead of <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item-1-of-item-1-of-A.png" alt="item (1) of (item (1) of (A))" title="item (1) of (item (1) of (A))" />, which was confusing too.
            </div>
            <div class="stagedir">
                Betsy's two other blocks: <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/xcoord.png" alt="x coordinate = item 1" title="x coordinate = item 1" />
