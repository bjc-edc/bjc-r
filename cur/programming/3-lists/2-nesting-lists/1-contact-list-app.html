        <p>All cell phones have some kind of Contacts list. In this lab, you will build a Contacts app yourself.</p>
        <div class="todo">Answers to Mary comments below (Mary, please delete if you're happy):
        <ul><li>We are building toward data abstraction.  In the end, we're going to reserve green Operator blocks for the constructors and selectors that implement an ADT, and use grey Other blocks for application code above the abstraction barrier.</li>
        <li>They've seen <code>keep</code> before, and that's doubly true now that I've moved the "More Lists of Lists" stuff to a page in Lab 1.</li>
        <li>I don't understand why <code>name from number</code> is any easier than <code>phone number of</code>.  They are exactly the same code except that one tests item 1 and reports item 2, and the other vice versa.  <code>Phone number of</code> belongs first because it's the more usual thing to do with a contact list.</li>
        <li>The name order stuff isn't TIF because we need it later, in the ADT lesson.</li>
        <li>I tried to address the confusion of the "contact here" pictures by changing the variable-looking slot to a list-looking slot; I'm not sure if that'll help, but I'm not sure that saying <code>(list (list Abraham Lincoln) 555-2368)</code> would be any better.  Anyway, I think this half-finished-picture idea is too good to give up, and we should <em>teach</em> it explicitly in U1.</li></ul></div>

                <li>Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3L2-ContactList.xml">this starter version</a> of the app.</li>
                <li>Press  "Add Contact"  and read the script to understand how it works. Each new contact is  a list, so the list of contacts is a <em>list of lists.</em> In each contact, item 1 is a name and item 2 is (supposed to be) a phone number.</li>
                <li>Fix the <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-phone.png" alt="get phone"> block so that it works similarly to <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-name.png" alt="get name">.</li>

                    Write a reporter <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/phone-number-of.png" alt="phone number of ()"> that takes any part of a person's name as input, and  reports that person's phone number, or "not found" if the name is not in the contact list. You will need:
                    <div class="comment">I'm not in support of using keep like this before they have any clue what it is. I like EBF like what's on the Exploring List Processing page, but not this. This seems like it's going to throw a lot of students off. :( --MF</div>

                <li>When someone calls you, the phone company sends only the calling number to your phone, not the person's name. But if the number is in your contact list, your phone  figures out the name. So you'll also want a block<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-from-number.png" alt="name from number ()"> that searches for a phone number and reports the contact's name.</li>

				<li>
					<div class="sidenote">In some cultures, the family name—the one you  use for alphabetizing—is written first. For example, in "Sun Yat-Sen" the family name is "Sun." So instead of asking for "first and middle name(s)" and for "last name" you might want to say "given name(s)" and "family name."</div> 
					Our starter version of the app uses a single text string to hold a person's entire name. This is fine for displaying the name on the screen but makes it hard to  display a list of all  contacts <em>sorted by family name.</em> So we really want to keep the family name separate from the given name(s).
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Modify the <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-name.png" alt="get name"> block so that it asks separately for given names and for family name, and reports a list of the two answers. Check to make sure that adding a new contact does what you expect.</li>
						<div class="commentBig">Ack! I think this is confusing and that we should avoid doing things like this (or any other kind of pseudo Snap<em>!</em> code):<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-display-result.png" alt="name (display form) --&gt; Abraham Lincoln"><br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-sorting-result.png" alt="name (sorting form) --&gt; Lincoln, Abraham"><br />I actually don't know what this is intended to mean (or else I would change it myself). Why not put a contact in there and make this an example expression? The kids I met this week would probably be just as confused (or more) than I am. --MF</div>
                        <li>Write two reporters that take a contact as input and report the name as a text string, in two different orders:<br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-display-result.png" alt="name (display form) --&gt; Abraham Lincoln"><br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-sorting-result.png" alt="name (sorting form) --&gt; Lincoln, Abraham"><br />
                        (Don't worry, yet, about how to handle family-name-first names. We'll get to that soon.)</li>

                        <li>Make sure your <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/phone-number-of.png" alt="phone number of ()"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-from-number.png" alt="name from number ()"> blocks still work.</li>

			You will soon make more improvements to this app, after two pages introducing the idea of <em>abstract data types,</em> which you'll need when we return to the contact app.</div>
