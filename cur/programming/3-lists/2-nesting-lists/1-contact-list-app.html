					<div class="sidenote">In some cultures, the family name—the one you  use for alphabetizing—is written first. For example, in "Sun Yat-Sen" the family name is "Sun." So instead of asking for "first and middle name(s)" and for "last name" you might want to say "given name(s)" and "family name."</div> 
					Our starter version of the app uses a single text string to hold a person's entire name. This is fine for displaying the name on the screen but makes it hard to  display a list of all  contacts <em>sorted by family name.</em> So we really want to keep the family name separate from the given name(s).
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Modify the <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-name.png" alt="get name"> block so that it asks separately for given names and for family name, and reports a list of the two answers. Check to make sure that adding a new contact does what you expect.</li>

I think this is confusing and that we should avoid doing things like this (or any other kind of pseudo Snap<em>!</em> code):<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-display-result.png" alt="name (display form) --&gt; Abraham Lincoln"><br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-sorting-result.png" alt="name (sorting form) --&gt; Lincoln, Abraham"><br />I actually don't know what this is intended to mean (or else I would change it myself). Why not put a contact in there and make this an example expression? The kids I met this week would probably be just as confused (or more) than I am. --MF</div>
                        <li>Write two reporters that take a contact as input and report the name as a text string, in two different orders:<br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-display-result.png" alt="name (display form) --&gt; Abraham Lincoln"><br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-sorting-result.png" alt="name (sorting form) --&gt; Lincoln, Abraham"><br />
                        (Don't worry, yet, about how to handle family-name-first names. We'll get to that soon.)</li>
