        <h2>Contact<a name="contactlist" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>List App</h2>
All cell phones have some kind of Contacts list. In this lab, you will build a Contacts app yourself. 
		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3L2-ContactList.xml">this starter version</a> of the app.</li>
                <li>Press  "Add Contact"  and read the script to understand how it works. Each new contact is  a list, so the list of contacts is a <em>list of lists.</em></li>
                <li>Fix the <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-phone.png" alt="get phone"> block so that it works similarly to<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-name.png" alt="get name">.</li>
    <li>Clear your contact list and add a few made-up people to make sure everything works.</li>
                <li>Write a reporter <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/phone-number-of.png" alt="phone number of ()"> that takes any part of a person's name as input, and  reports that person's phone number, or "not found" if the name is not in the contact list.  Here are two new blocks to help you:
                  <ol type="a">
                    <Li>The <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/string-contains.png" alt="&lt;string () contains ()&gt;"> block will help you find out whether a particular contact's name matches the user's input string.</Li>
                    <Li>The <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="keep items such that &lt;  &gt; from (list)"> block will apply a test (its first input) to <em>each item of</em> a list (its second input), and will report a new list containing only those items for which the test succeeds. (Remember that when you have a lot of contacts there might be more than one named John. If that happens, just give the phone number of the first one in the list.) If none of the items satisfies the test, then <code>keep</code> will report an empty list.</Li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>When someone calls your phone, your phone service sends the calling number to the phone. But if the number is in your contact list, what the phone actually displays is the contact's name. So you'll also want a block<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-from-number.png" alt="name from number ()"> that searches for a phone number and reports the contact's name.</li>
                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />        
                <li>Our starter version of the app represents a person's name as a single text string containing all parts of the name. This is fine for displaying the name on the screen. But your phone's contacts app can also display an alphabetical list of all the contacts <em>sorted by last name.</em> So we really want to keep the last name separate from the first (and middle if any) name.
                <ol type="a">
                   <li>Modify the <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-name.png" alt="get name"> block so that it asks separately for first-and-middle name and for last name, and reports a list of the two answers. (In some cultures, the family name&mdash;the one you want to use for alphabetizing&mdash;is written first, For example, in &quot;Sun Yat-Sen&quot; the family name is &quot;Sun.&quot;  So instead of asking for &quot;first and middle name(s)&quot; and for &quot;last name&quot; you might want to use the terminology &quot;given name(s)&quot; and &quot;family name.&quot;) Make sure that adding a new contact does what you expect.</li>
                   <li>Write two reporters that take a contact as input and report the name as a text string, in two different orders:<br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-display-result.png" alt="name (display form) --&gt; Abraham Lincoln"><br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-sorting-result.png" alt="name (sorting form) --&gt; Lincoln, Abraham"><br />
                     (Don't wotty, yet, about how to handle family-name-first names.)</li>
                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-mini.png" alt="Save Your Work" title="Save Your Work" />
                   <li>Make sure your <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/phone-number-of.png" alt="phone number of ()"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-from-number.png" alt="name from number ()"> blocks still work.</li>
                </ol>
                </li></ol>
                We're going to come back to this app soon, but first time out for some quick practice with lists of lists.

	<h3> More lists of lists</h3>
		<p>
			Here are three lists of lists: one is a list of world capitals and their countries; one is a list of showtimes on the four screens of a movie theater; and one is a to-do list with categories:<br />

Then when <code>i</code> is 2, the sprite glides to (item 1 of item 2, item 2 of item 2. And then it goes to the third and fouth points too.</div>
