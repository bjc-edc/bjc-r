        <div class="todo"><!--Add contacts list app: Suggestion 1:  When lists of lists are introduced, build on the structure of the shopping list app to -->make a <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3L2-ContactList.xml">contacts list app</a>, in which each entry (abstraction!) is a contact<!--, just Gamal is suggesting each pair of coordinates is a point and we are suggesting each pitch-duration combination is a note-->.  <strong>If we include address, then U4 can locate the contacts on a map and U5 can sort it.</strong> Let the U3 version of the project search the list for a contact and display it. It would be nice if it also could correct/update the information in a contact or <s>delete a particular contact</s> (done on this page, 1).  </div>
        <p>
            Here are three lists of lists: one is a list of world capitals and their countries; one is a list of showtimes on the four screens of a movie theater; and one is a to-do list with categories:<br />
     <!--       <div class="sidenote">Lists of lists (i.e. arrays of arrays) are very powerful. If each inner list has the same number of items, you can think of a list of lists like a table of data (or a matrix).</div>  -->
