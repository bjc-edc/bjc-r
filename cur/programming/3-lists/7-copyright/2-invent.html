    	<h2>How Inventions Happen</h2>

<div class="sidenote">
(More than three, actually. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_telephone#Telephone_prehistory">This Wikipedia article</a> discusses five people with a claim to having invented the telephone.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisha_Gray_and_Alexander_Bell_telephone_controversy">The legal battles between Bell and Gray</a> lasted ten years before a U.S. Supreme Court decision definitively awarded the U.S. patent to Bell.  But even today, there are people who argue about what really happened at the patent office in February, 1876.)</div>
 
<p>How did it happen that three people invented the telephone at just about the same time?  Why did two people invent the phonograph in 1877?</p>

<p>It's not a mystery why several people make the same invention at the same time.  The popular myth is that genius inventors suddenly have an idea arrive out of the blue, but actually, many engineers start working a problem at the same time, once <strong>enabling technologies</strong> come along.  In the case of the telephone, the main enabling technology was the telegraph, which could already send messages, but not voices, over long distances using electricity.</p>

<p>In the 1870s, all electrical engineers knew that a telegraph-like device that could transmit voices (rather than just on-off clicks) was waiting to happen.  That's why several of them worked on it. The telephone itself was an enabling technology for the phonograph, which needed a way to turn sounds into electricity.</p>

<p>Once in a while, someone does invent something that nobody else was working on.  The Xerox copier and Velcro fasteners are often cited as examples.</p></div>
