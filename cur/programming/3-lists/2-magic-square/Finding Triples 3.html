  <p>Here's one version of the <code>lookup</code> reporter from the previous page. It uses the higher-order function <code>map</code>:</p>

  <div><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/lookup_reporter.png" alt="code for lookup reporter"></div>

  <p>When using <code>map</code>, a new list is built the same size as <code>locations</code>. Each member of the new list is the result of the <code>item</code> block.</p>

  <p>How is this helpful? Now you can pull any set of 3 numbers from the list of 9 numbers, on demand.</p>

  <p>And, you have a handy list of triples you'd like to know about: <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/triples.png" alt="list of triples"></p>


<ol>
  <li> Write <code>all-triples</code> that takes <code>square</code>, a set of 9 numbers, and reports a list of eight triples, the values in <code>square</code> for each row, column, and diagonal. Remember that <code>triples</code> is a global variable that can be used anywhere.

  <div><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/all_triples_1.png" style="height:50%;" alt="output from all-triples"></div>

 </li>
</ol>

<p> The output from <code>all-triples</code> can be a little hard to read. It's a list of 8 smaller lists, each with 3 elements. </p>

<ol start="2">
  <li> Write a description of how you could take this information and determine whether the original 9 numbers form a magic square. </li>
</ol>
