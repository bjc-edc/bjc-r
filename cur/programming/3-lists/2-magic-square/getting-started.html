<p> In this lesson, you will build a function that determines whether or not a set of numbers forms a <i>magic square</i>. In a <i>magic square</i>, the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal must be equal.</p>

<p> The data will be presented as a list, like this:

<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/magicsquare.png" alt="Magic Square Checker"></p>

<p> The <code>is a magic square?</code> block is a hexagonal block called a <i>predicate</i>. It reports <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. The data above corresponds to this ugly HTML 3-by-3 square of numbers:

<table border="1" width=50px; height=50px; align="center" text-align="center"> <!-- CSS? -->
    <tr>
        <td>9</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</p>

<ol> For each of these, decide whether the <code>is a magic square?</code> block should report <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
  <li> <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/square1.png" alt="Is this a magic square?"> </li>
  <li> <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/square2.png" alt="Is this a magic square?"> </li>
  <li> <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/square3.png" alt="Is this a magic square?"> </li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

Now that you've had some experience deciding what makes something a magic square, it's time to write an algorithm.

<ol start="4">
  <li> <i>Using as much detail as possible</i>, describe&ndash;in words, not in code&ndash;an algorithm that you can use to decide whether or not a list of 9 numbers forms a magic square.</li>
  <li> Exchange your algorithm with a partner. Follow your partner's algorithm on this list:
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/square4.png" alt="Is this a magic square?"></p>
    Discuss with your partner any improvements or clarifications needed to make your algorithms as clear as possible.</li>

</ol>
