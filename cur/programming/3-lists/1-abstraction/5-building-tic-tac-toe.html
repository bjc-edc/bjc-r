		<h2>Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>In this project,</strong> you will develop a program that plays Tic-Tac-Toe as well as you do.</p>
            <p><strong>On this first page,</strong> you use <em>clones</em> to display a Tic-Tac-Toe board and let two human players enter moves.</p>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/TTT1_img/Three States of TTT.png" width="550"  alt="Three states of Tic-Tac-Toe: in progress, win, tie" title="Three states of Tic-Tac-Toe: in progress, win, tie"/>
        </div>
		<p>The project is spread out over different units because there's a lot to do, and because some steps require techniques you haven't learned yet. On <em>this</em> page, you'll learn about <em>cloning</em> a sprite (like copying it, only better). In the future, you'll extend the project to detect wins and ties and, ultimately, to let the computer be one of the players.</p>
		<p>One approach to building this game is to use <em>multiple sprites</em>; each square of the board is a separate sprite. Each sprite knows where it is on the board, and, once positioned, the sprites never move. The player clicks one of the nine squares, and that sprite changes its costume to display the move.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li><a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3L1-TicTacToe.xml" target="_blank"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/load-save.png" alt="Click here to load this file. Then save it to your Snap! account." title="Click here to load this file. Then save it to your Snap! account." /></a></li>
                <li>
                	The first sprite has already been set up for you. It has three costumes: Empty, X, and O. Click <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/next-costume.png" alt="next costume" title="next costume" /> a few times to see all of them.<br />
                    <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/TTT1_img/Costumes.png" height="100" alt="Costumes of a square: Empty, X and O" title="Costumes of a square: Empty, X and O" />
				</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>You will use <em>clones</em> to create the 3&times;3 Tic-Tac-Toe board.<a name="clones" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
            <p>A <strong>clone</strong> is a copy of a sprite that <em>shares information</em> with its parent sprite (the original sprite). For example, clones have copies of any scripts from the parent, and if the parent's script is changed, then the clones' scripts change too. However, changes you make to a clone are <em>not</em> shared with the parent, so you can do things like move each clone to a different position.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Clones start with the same position, costumes, and scripts of their parent. But clones made by a program...
			<ul>
                <li><em>Don't</em> appear in the sprite corral.</li>
                <li>Are <em>temporary</em>. Clicking the stop button or green flag will delete all temporary clones in the project.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
		<p>(There can also be permanent clones, which are created differently, but they're not used in this project.)</p>
		<div class="endnote">
			In this project, you'll need <em>nine</em> clones, one for each square of the Tic-Tac-Toe board. So, you'd need something like:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/9-copies.png" alt="repeat (9){create a clone of (myself)}" title="repeat (9){create a clone of (myself)}"><br />
			The actual code you write will be slightly more than this, but this is the central idea. You'll need nine clones, and you will hide the parent. This will allow you to control the squares of the grid with blocks like:<br />

	            <li>
                    Before clicking anything else, read this demonstration script with your partner. Discuss what will happen when you click the sprite. <br />

                	Then click the sprite on the stage, and compare what happens with what you expected.
                    <div class="narrower">
                    	<ul>

							<li>Notice that the parent sprite (not the clone) moves to the new random position after cloning itself. Look back at the code; why does this make sense?</li>
                    		<li>Note that <em>both</em> the clones and the parent <em>are sprites</em>. Both are clickable (try it) and draggable (try that too). This is different from the effect of the <code>stamp</code> Pen block, which just leaves a picture of the sprite on the stage.</li>
                            <li>The <code>create a clone</code> block takes an input because it can copy <em>any</em> sprite. In this project, there's only one sprite at the beginning, so your choices are either <var>myself</var> or <var>Square</var> (the sprite's name), which in this case, means the same thing.</li>

                            Connect the <code>when</code> <span style="color:green">âš‘</span> <code>clicked</code> block toward the bottom of the scripting area to the script just below it.<br />

                                            When alternating between two values, it's convenient to use Booleans because you can use <code>not</code> to switch between them and you can use <code>if</code> to <em>test</em> the variable. (Recall that <code>if</code> requires a <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> input.)<br />

                            <li>Be sure to <code>show</code> the original sprite before cloning it, so that the clones will be visible.  After cloning nine times to create the board, <code>hide</code> the original sprite so it does not interfere with the game as a tenth square.</li>
