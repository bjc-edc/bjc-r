			<p>Grace Hopper (1906-1992) was an United States Navy rear admiral and pioneer of computer programming. She is best known for her trailblazing contributions to computer programming, software development, and the design and implementation of programming languages.</p>

			<p>One early case of "debugging" was when an actual moth got stuck inside a computer Grace Hopper was working with in 1947. Here is a page from her notebook with the moth pasted in.</p>

				<li><strong>Try to write elegant code.</strong> If you're writing a state capitals quiz, then you'll need to store every state and capital in your program, but if you're writing a multiplication quiz you can have the computer calculate the answers. Take advantage of the natural structure of the problem you are solving.</li>
				<li><div class="ap-standard">AAP-2.B.7</div><strong>Use abstraction</strong> to hide complexity. Isolate some details into a custom block, and get that working right. Then use that abstraction just as if it were built into Snap<em>!</em>. Abstraction allows you to build and test pieces of your code one at a time; it makes your code more readable. If you can't see an entire script on your screen at once, it's time to stop and organize your code.</li>
				<li><strong>Don't delete your project and start over.</strong> This sounds obvious when you see it written down, but programming students sometimes get angry at their bugs. Remember that if you have a program with 20 blocks in it, and one of the 20 has an error, then your program is 95% correct.</li>
				<li>
					How to find a bug:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Reproduce the problem</strong> so you are sure you know how to recreate it. This will help you know when you've fixed it. </li>
						<li><strong>Isolate the piece of code producing the error.</strong> Test pieces of your code separately so you know what's working and what isn't.</li>
						<li><strong>Identify the specific cause of the error</strong> within that code. <em>Why</em> is that code doing the wrong thing?</li>
						<li><strong>Always test your code with different inputs.</strong> Look for extreme cases: What if the input is really big, zero, negative, or a decimal? What if the user types something you aren't expecting? What if the user clicks somewhere else?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Don't add code to work around a bug.</strong> In fact, don't edit buggy code at all (except to add temporary debugging code) until you understand the problem; then <em>remove</em> the error. Think: "Debug by subtraction, not by addition."</li>
				<li><strong>Don't be hard on yourself.</strong> <em>Everyone</em> gets bugs in their programs; it's part of programming.</li>
				<li><strong>If it works, it's correct.</strong> You don't need to ask your teacher "Is this right?" The computer will tell you whether your solution is correct, and more than one solution may work.</li>
				<li><strong>Be open to new ideas.</strong> Especially if you learned to program before this course, a few of the ideas in this course might seem strange to you, such as the use of higher-order functions instead of looping. One of the goals of BJC is to introduce you to different ways of organizing a program that make the code shorter and don't have as many openings for bugs to creep in.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Love your bugs!</strong> They pose an interesting puzzle. Sometimes their incorrect behavior suggests another project:<br />

                            <strong>Checking the box next to a variable in the palette</strong> (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/var-check.png" width="82" alt="Variable with check-box checked">) will also show the value of that variable or sprite attribute.

                            <strong><img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/show-variable.png" alt="show variable" title="show variable" /></strong> lets you do the equivalent of checking the box for script variables, which aren't in the palette.

                    The <strong>"Unused blocks..."</strong> option in the Snap<em>!</em> File menu will eliminate blocks you no longer need. This is often useful when you've loaded a library but you only need one or two blocks from the library.

                <li>
                    The <strong>"clean up" option</strong> in the right-click (or control-click on a Mac) menu of the scripting area background will reposition scripts on the page so they don't overlap.

                    <strong>Snap<em>!</em> lets you use more than one word in the name of a block or variable</strong>. Some programmers try to save time by naming all their variables <var>x</var>, but if they forget and call a <em>second</em> variable <var>x</var>, this can lead to bugs. To make your programs easier to understand and debug, you can use meaningful names, such as <var>horizontal position</var>, instead.
