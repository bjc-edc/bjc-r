        	One early case of "debugging" was when an actual moth got stuck inside a computer in 1947. Here is a page from Grace Hopper's notebook with the moth pasted in:

        	<p><strong>Debugging</strong> is the art of identifying errors in computer programs and fixing them.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Don't delete your project and start over.</strong> This sounds obvious when you see it written down, but programming students sometimes get angry at their bugs. Remember that if you have a program with 20 blocks in it, and one of the 20 has an error, then your program is 95% correct.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't be hard on yourself.</strong> <em>Everyone</em> gets bugs in their programs; it's part of programming.</li>
		<li><strong>Don't add code to <em>work around</em> the bug.</strong> Don't edit the code at all (except to add temporary debugging code) until you understand why it's not doing what you intended, then <em>remove</em> the error. Think: "Debug by subtraction, not by addition."</li>
		<li><strong>Try to write beautiful code.</strong> If you're writing a quiz program to help someone learn the state capitals, then yes, in some way or another you're going to have 50 separate state-to-city connections in your project.  But if you're writing a quiz program to help someone learn the multiplication tables, and you have 100 <code>if</code> blocks in your program, then you aren't taking advantage of the natural structure of the problem.  The computer can figure out arithmetic answers for you.  In general, a good rule of thumb is that if you can't see an entire script on your screen at once, it's time to stop and organize your code better.</li>
		<li>How to find a bug:
		<ul>
                <li><strong>Reproduce the problem</strong> so you are sure you know how to recreate it. This will help you know when you've fixed it. </li>
                <li><strong>Isolate the piece of code producing the error.</strong> Test pieces of your code separately so you know what's working and what isn't.</li>
                <li><strong>Identify the specific cause of the error</strong> within that code. <em>Why</em> is that code doing the wrong thing?</li>
                <li><strong>Always test your code with different inputs.</strong> Look for extreme cases: What if the input is really big, zero, negative, or a decimal? What if the user types something you aren't expecting? What if the user clicks somewhere else?</li>
		</ul></li>
                <li>
               	<strong>Love your bugs!</strong> They pose an interesting puzzle. Sometimes their incorrect behavior suggests another project:<br />
					<img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/love-bug.png" width="460" alt="buggy triangle turns into star by repetition">
                </li>
		<li>Keep the following two opposite ideas in mind at once:
		    <ul>
		      <li><strong>If it works, it's correct.</strong>  One of the school rituals hated by both students and teachers is everyone tugging on the teacher's sleeve saying "Is this right?"  One of the joys of programming is that the computer itself will tell you whether your solution is correct.  But also...</li>
		      <li><strong>Be open to new ideas.</strong>  This is especially important if you've programmed before.  If you automatically write
					<img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/cliche-loop.png" alt="for i = 1 to (length of (input list))" title="for i = 1 to (length of (input list))"><br />
		      before you've even read the problem statement, then one of our goals in this course is to introduce you to different ways of organizing a program, such as higher order functions, that make the code shorter and don't have as many openings for bugs to creep in.

	                <strong>Use abstraction</strong> to hide the complexity of code. Abstraction is a way of thinking; you tuck some details into one part of your code and get them working right, and then use that chunk confidently, just as if it were built into Snap<em>!</em>. Some examples of using abstraction include creating custom blocks and using abstract data types. These kinds of abstraction allow you to build and test pieces of your code one at a time, so bugs are automatically isolated.  Abstraction makes your code readable.
