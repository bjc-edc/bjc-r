        <h3>Drawing One Brick</h3>
        <p>
            A picture of a brick is just a rectangle with a brick red color. However, there's no <code>draw rectangle</code> block in <span class="snap">snap</span>. One way to draw one is by thinking of a rectangle as a very thick line. Here's the idea:<br />
            <div class="sidenoteBig">Any good programming language might have many tools for drawing and moving, but it wouldn't make sense to have special tools for drawing bricks because most programs don't involve bricks. That's the sort of tool you make yourself when you need it.</div>

        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Abstraction</strong>
            <div class="comment">AAP-3.B.1, AAP-3.B.5</div>
            <p>As you learned in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/2-gossip.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 1 Lab 2 Page 2: Making Programs Talk">Unit 1 Lab 2 Page 2: Making Programs Talk</a>, <strong>procedural abstraction</strong> is the process of developing a program by breaking up a large problem into smaller sub-problems.</p>
            <p>Creating a <code>draw brick</code> block lets you think in terms of a procedure with a name related to the problem you are solving. This makes your code easier to read, and once you've coded and debugged the block, you don't need to think about how it works each time you use it. That's the beauty of procedural abstraction.</p>
		</div>

        <h3>Using Problem Decomposition</h3>
		<p>
        	You'd like the "top level" block to be something like this:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/draw-brick-wall-7.png" alt="draw Brick Wall with (7) rows" title="draw Brick Wall with (7) rows"/><br />
            Getting there involves <strong>problem decomposition</strong>: breaking the problem into smaller pieces.
        </p>
		<p>
        	There are two kinds of rows, so we make blocks that specialize in each:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Row A</strong>: <img class="noshadow" border="0" title="Row A" alt="Row A" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/row-a.png" /></li>
                <li><strong>Row B</strong>: <img class="noshadow" border="0" title="Row B" alt="Row B" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/row-b.png" /></li>
            </ul>

                    <div id="hint-too-much" class="collapse">
                        <p>It's possible to go overboard on abstraction and build so many blocks that your program is just as cluttered as it would be without the custom blocks. But it <em>can</em> be useful to make a custom block even when its definition is just one built-in block. For example, to draw the cement between blocks (shown as white space), you can just use <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/move4.png" alt="Move 4 Steps">, but it might make sense to define a <code>draw cement</code> block that uses <code>move</code> inside it. </p>
                        <p>Why? You might later decide that four steps is the wrong thickness for cement and you'd rather have five. Or you might want the cement to be cement-colored, slightly gray. With many <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/move4.png" alt="Move 4 Steps"> scattered through your program, you would have to find and change each one. To make matters worse, your complete project might have <code>move</code> blocks that <em>aren't</em> about cement. But with a <code>draw cement</code> block, you can change just its definition, and all the cement in your picture will be changed.</p>
