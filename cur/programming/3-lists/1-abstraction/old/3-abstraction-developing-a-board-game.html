		<h2>Developing a Board Game</h2>
        <div class="todo">
        	From BH 10/27/15 observations:
            <ul>
            	<li>Most kids seem to be solving the WHICH CELL? problem with a FOR loop into which they try to put a reporter instead of a command. Their basic idea is that when the function comes out true they should report the index, but they don't know how to express that. I was surprised that nobody seems to be getting that you can solve the problem directly by doing arithmetic on the position, without looping. Do we want to give a hint?</li>
                <li>C-shaped slots (as in the FOR block) are too willing to accept reporters (on the theory that the reporter might report a script). Maybe we should make this harder to do.</li>
                <li>A lot of kids are having trouble keeping track of what they know about the board geometry. In particular, they struggle with offsetting their calculations to account for the fact that the board doesn't start at (0,0).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>In Unit 1, you started building a tic-tac-toe game by writing the code to draw the game board. Now you'll take another step by sensing which cell a player wants to move into and centering the "X" or "O" in that cell.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">  
            <ol>
                <li>Load your project <strong>U1L4-TicTacToe</strong>. Save it as <strong>U2L4-TicTacToe</strong> (be sure to choose "Save as..." from the File menu, not just "Save").</li>
                <li>
                    Build a predicate <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/between.png" alt="Is () between () and () ?"> that tests whether its first input is bigger than the second input and less than the third. You'll use this to test where the sprite is.<br />
                  <!-- I don't see wht benefit these images offer. --MF
                  <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/between-true.png" alt="is 27 between 12 and 40? -&gt; true"><br />
                  <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/between-false.png" alt="is 27 between 12 and 20? -&gt; false"><br />-->
				</li>
				<li>Build a predicate <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/on-the-board-p.png" alt="on the board?"> that uses your <code>between?</code> block to report <code>true</code> if the sprite is on the board and report <code>false</code> if the sprite is dragged completely off the board.</li>
				<li> 
					Build a reporter <code>which cell?</code> that tells which cell the sprite has been dragged into. One way to do that is to build  blocks that reports <code>which column?</code> and <code>which row?</code> the sprite is in and then figure out how to use them to report the exact cell.<br />
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">One way to do this is to think of specific examples: What if the sprite is at the position <var>(90, 110)</var>? What if the sprite is at the position <var>(-100, 80)</var>?</div>
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">If you need more help: <a href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/which-row-which-column.xml" download>download this file</a> and import it into your project. It contains completed <code>which row?</code> and <code>which column?</code> blocks, but try to build them yourself first.</div>
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/which-cell(n)-without-computation.png" alt="partial script for 'which-cell?' reporter"><br />
                    <p>Remember: Your board  isn't <em>only</em> for tic-tac-toe. You can draw nine-by-nine Sudoku boards, seven-by-seven Connect Four boards, and so on. So, these blocks will need the input <var>n</var> to specify how many rows and columns are in the grid.</p>
					<div class="endnote">There are many ways to write <code>which row?</code> and <code>which column?</code> You might think of using lots of <code>if</code> statements, but since the number of rows can change, you don't know how many to use. One convenient way is to divide the total size of the game board by the size of each cell. To use that result, you need to round down. The <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/round-a-number.png" alt="round a number"> block can do it, but it rounds to the <em>nearest</em> integer, up <em>or</em> down. The function <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/floor.png" alt="floor function" title="floor function" /> always rounds <em>down</em>, making it easier to use. Likewise, the function  <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/ceiling.png" alt="ceiling function" title="ceiling function" /> always rounds <em>up</em>. The <code>floor</code> and <code>ceiling</code> functions are in the same block as <code>sqrt</code>.</div>
				</li>
                <li>
                    Here's a script that you can use to test how well your block works. Use it with the second sprite, which draws the board. Try it out for boards with different numbers of tiles. (The video shows it only on a 3&times;3 board.)<br />

				</li>
				<div class="sidenote">To create <code>move to tile</code>, you may want <code>mod</code>. You saw <code>mod</code> in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/4-grids-for-games/2-computer-operations.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 1 Lesson 4, Expressions and Operations</a>.</div>
                <li>Create a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/move-to-tile.png" alt="move to tile () on borad with () tiles per row" title="move to tile () on borad with () tiles per row" /> block that takes a tile number as input and moves your sprite to <em>the center </em>of that tile. Because the location of the tile (for example, tile 7) depends on how many tiles there are in a row, this block will also need an input that says how many tiles are in each row.</li>
				<li>Modify the <code>when I am dropped</code> script for the XO sprite so that when the sprite is dropped, it  moves to the center of its tile before it is stamped.</li>
                <div class="endnote"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-mini.png" alt="Save Your Work" title="Save Your Work" /> Save your work. In Unit 3, you will continue with this project and write code to keep track of which tiles have been taken  by which player.</div>
