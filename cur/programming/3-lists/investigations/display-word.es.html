    	<h2>Display Word</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine that you're writing a program to play Hangman. The program has thought of a secret word, and the user is trying to guess it. Write a <code>display word</code> block that takes two inputs, the secret word and a list of the letters guessed by the user so far. It should report the letters of the secret word, spaced out, with underscore characters replacing the letters not yet guessed:<br />
            <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/display-word-list.es.png" alt="display word (potsticker) (e,t,a) -&gt; _ _ t _ t _ _ _ e _" title="display word (potsticker) (e,t,a) -&gt; _ _ t _ t _ _ _ e _">
        </p>
        <p>(Use the <code>word &rarr; list</code> block or the <code>split</code> block on the secret word to get started.) </p>
        <p>
            In your own program, you would likely use this block within a <code>say</code> block, like this:<br />
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/list/display-word-in-say.es.png" alt="display word inside a say block" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p>Consider why it's best to make the block a reporter, rather than directly <code>say</code>ing the result. </p>
