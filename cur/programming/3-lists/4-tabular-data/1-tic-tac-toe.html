    	<h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
        <div class="todo">FROM PAUL:  I would not start with magic squares.  Checking for a win in <a href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3L4-TicTacToeWithoutChecking.xml" class="run">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> is, in terms of processing a list, exactly the same logic we want students to use except for the COMBINE WITH + step.  TTT is way more familiar to students than magic squares, and the current FYtD start uses the pain of adding up a bunch of numbers as the motivator to build a program to do it for you.  If the intro started instead with does (list X O X X O O X X O) contain a winning position? and other such lists, students would still be looking for all the ways to recognize rows, columns, and diagonals.  They could then apply it to the board game, attached, parts of which theyâ€™ve already built in U2.  (It would be nice if they built the remaining non-list-using parts before starting the list parts, so that they have done the whole thing, but we could give them bits and save the full project for next year.) The development could follow closely what is already on this page, just switching the context from arithmetic to scoring TTT. --PG</div>
