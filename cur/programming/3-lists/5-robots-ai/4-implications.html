    	<h2>Implications of AI</h2>
        <div class="todo">From BJCx: How do you feel about the advancements in Artificial Intelligence that are allowing computers to continue to be better than humans in so many activities?  Do you believe (as many do) that machines will eventually challenge us (and in the worst case, take over), or will they hit an upper-limit and never develop to that point? --MF, 12/17/16</div>

                            The "uncanny valley" is a term that describes the eerie feeling when we realize that something we thought was human is not actually human.

How does your understanding of AI affect your views of technology and war?</li>
                        <li>Teaching robots right from wrong isn't just about AI as weapons.--><li>What about a self-driving car that has to make a choice between the life of its passenger and the life of a pedestrian? How does that choice get made?</li>
                        <li>There's also the issue of who gets the benefits of AI. The people whose jobs are being replaced by robots are disproportionately lower-income. How can we make sure that everyone benefits from developments in AI?</li>
                        <li>What laws apply to AI? What happens with a robot commits a crime? Who gets punished?</li>
