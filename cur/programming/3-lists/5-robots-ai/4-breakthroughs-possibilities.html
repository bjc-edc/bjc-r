        	<li><strong>JK: I don't have a place for this note from Brian</strong>: I'd like to say something, if we can make it understandable, about the way non-physical products (software, movies, etc.) distort the market for physical stuff (especially housing). People get rich on ideas, but you can't eat ideas, and the supply of real stuff isn't infinitely expandable, so in effect real stuff becomes more expensive for people not in the virtual-stuff business.</li>

            	<li>Artificial Intelligence is a very active field with many interesting developments announced daily. Choose a topic you're interested in (like medicine, finance, politics, education, communication, law, gaming, astronomy, psychology, transportation, literature, international policy, etc.) and find 2-3 recent news articles that relate to developments in AI in that field. Be prepared to share what you find with the class.
                <ul>
                	<li>In addition to reporting new developments, mention challenges for AI that still remain.</li>

                    Discuss as a class:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What jobs (if any) do you think computers will never be <em>able</em> to do?</li>
                        <li>What jobs (if any) do you think computers should never be <em>allowed</em> to do?</li>
