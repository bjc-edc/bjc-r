        <h2>Curve Stitching</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <strong>Why do this?</strong> To give the students a chance to apply their skills of developing algorithms and using abstractions in the context of a visual arts project.  To motivate students with interest in arts and to give them an opportunity to synthesize their artistic skills with their knowledge of algorithms and coding.<br />
            <strong>Why here?</strong>  At this point in the curriculum the students know enough to be able to complete a computational visual art project with minimal hand-holding.

        <div class="todo">Edits to this page started with questioning why Astrid was capitalized. We ended up renaming the page and adding some links to examples. I cut the word Astrid across the page and reduced the image count by removing uncessary images. I also hinted some content. If someone else agrees with these edits, please remove this and the other comments. --MF, 9/7/18</div>

            This design uses straight lines to make shapes that look curved and is sometimes sewn with thread or drawn on paper. Here are some examples of and variations on this design made with string, computers, pencils on paper, and even pencils glued together:
