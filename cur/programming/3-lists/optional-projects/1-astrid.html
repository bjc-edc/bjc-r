        <h2>Astrid Design</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <strong>Why do this?</strong> To give the students a chance to apply their skills of developing algorithms and using abstractions in the context of a visual arts project.  To motivate students with interest in arts and to give them an opportunity to synthesize their artistic skills with their knowledge of algorithms and coding.<br />
            <strong>Why here?</strong>  At this point in the curriculum the students know enough to be able to complete a computational visual art project with minimal hand-holding.

            In this project you will create a design called "Astrid" and explore its variations.<br />

                    Here are some more variations that employ color and more complex geometric arrangements.  Create these and your own variations in Snap<em>!</em>.<br />

                <li>
                    Use what you know about creating animations in Snap<em>!</em> to produce an animation based on the Astrid design.  To allow for dynamic movements such as rotations, you will need to reimagine a completely different way of creating your Astrid than joining points with fixed coordinates.

                                This animation explores the artistic concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_space" target="_blank">"negative space"</a> by using a grid of rotating Astrids.  You can see the organic frame surrounding the Astrids by concentrating on a blue oval and relaxing your eyes.  How would you revise your Astrid construction to generate animations like this?<br />
