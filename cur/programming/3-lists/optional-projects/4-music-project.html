        <div class="todo">
            <p>PG: I'd very much want to have a map-onto-scale one. (I have an example somewhere.) Kids who care about music will find the switches interesting, and even kids who claim not to be able to hear the differences will.</p>
            <p>BH: This is fine as far as it goes, but it calls out for more, starting with a note-name-to-midi-number reporter, and then making a round.</p>
            <p>MF: BH has reviewing to do (see TG)</p>
            <p>This page has been renumbered; need to check if this throws off the numbering in the solutions or TG. --MF, 4/26/19</p>
