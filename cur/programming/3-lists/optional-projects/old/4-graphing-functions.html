        <h2>Graphing Functions</h2>
        <p>
            Your <code>PlotPoint</code> and <code>set window scale</code> procedures can be used for graphing <em>functions</em> as well as plotting data points, but you'll need to build a different graphing block that doesn't expect a list of points but instead takes a function as input and runs that function with varying values of <span class="katex">x</span> to generate points to plot.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/graph-datapoints-DerekData1927to2015.png" alt="Graph datapoints DerekData1927to2015" title="Graph datapoints DerekData1927to2015" /><br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/graph-function-(-5)+((()-(3))squared).png" alt="Graph function (-5) + ( ( ( ) - (3) ) squared)" title="Graph function (-5) + ( ( ( ) - (3) ) squared)" />
        </p>
        <p><code>Graph function</code> will need to plot the function in your graphing window; so it needs to know where the stage is. It can get that information from your mouse's position on the stage, and you already have a tool (<code>x value at stage coord</code>) that will translate the mouse’s position appropriately.</p>
            
        <div class="endnote">This graphing program will work a little differently than some others that you may have seen; it will not graph the function automatically but will instead let you "draw" the graph on the stage by dragging your mouse across the stage to provide the function input (<span class="katex">x</span>) values.</div>
        
        <p>
        	<code>PlotPoint</code> can use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/x-value-at-stage-coord-(mouse-x).png" alt="x-value-at-stage-coord-(mouse-x)"> as <span class="katex">x</span>, and so can your function. Your function's output is <code>PlotPoint</code>'s <span class="katex">y</span>. So you can <code>call</code> your function with that input, and use that value in <code>PlotPoint</code>.<br />

        	<!--You are used to placing reporters (including functions) in input slots, but what you get is the <em>value</em> of the function at that moment, not the function itself, that you can evaluate at many different moments.  -->To give  <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/Graph-function.png"  alt="Graph-function"> a function as input, you must define it to <em>expect</em> a function as input:<br />
