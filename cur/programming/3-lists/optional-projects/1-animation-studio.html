        <h2>Animation Studio</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <strong>In this project</strong>, you will create a studio for designing and animating a character.<br /><br />

            Lists are data structures which are very useful if you have many items, in some order, that you wish to keep track of.  Lists come in especially handy when you don't know ahead of time how many items you will have to keep track of.  In this project:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>The user will use the click-and-drag of the mouse to draw a character.</li>
                <li>The mouse locations (X and Y) visited during the drawing will be stored in a list.</li>
                <li>The user will move the character drawn using the up, down, right, left arrow keys.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first"> 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Watch the following video.  Discuss with your partner how would you design such a project.  Be sure to explore what data needs to be tracked and how lists can be employed to keep track of this data.<br />

                    The following questions may guide you in your thinking as you start coding:<br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>What initiates the drawing of the character?</li>
                        <li>How can you access the location of the mouse as it is moved around? (Hint: Sensing menu)</li>
                        <li>How can you make a drawing based on the mouse positions? (Hint: Pen menu)</li>
                        <li>How can you store the x and y positions of the mouse as the drawing is created?</li>
                        <li>Do you know ahead of time how many locations the user's mouse will visit while drawing?</li>
                        <li>Why is remembering the order of these locations important?</li>
                        <li>What data structure is called for?</li>
                        <li>What should happen when each of the following keys are pressed: up, down, right, left?</li>
                        <li>How should the location information stored in the lists be updated to accomplish these movements?</li>
                        <li>How should the revised drawings be created based on updated locations?</li>
                    </ul>
                    Start coding! Many things will clear up when you actually get to work.

            Here are some code blocks that may be handy:<br />

                Brainstorm with your partner about some possible extensions and bonus explorations of the project.
                Here are some ideas, do some of these or come up with your own:
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Use abstraction and revise your code so that all the arrow key inputs (up/down/right/left) can be addressed by a single block with inputs.</li>
                    <li>Add background image(s), sound/music to your character animation.</li>
                    <li>Give the user options (such as color, pen thickness, etc.) in the drawing phase.</li>
                    <!--<li>Allow for other types of character animations: rotate, flip, shrink/enlarge.</li>-->
                    <li>Create a series of animations on your Animation Studio program. Capture, combine and edit them with a software like <a href="https://www.screencast-o-matic.com" target="blank" title="Screencast-O-Matic">Screencast-O-Matic</a> and then upload your work to YouTube and share with your classmates.</li>
                    <li>Research about advanced character design and animation studio software in the market, such as Maya 3D, Unity 3D etc.</li>
                    <li>Research about Pixar Animation Studios.  How did they start? How do they work?  Learn about the internship opportunities they offer.</li>
                </ol>
