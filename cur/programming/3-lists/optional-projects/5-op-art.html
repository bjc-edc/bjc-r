        <div class="learn">
            In this project, you will write code to create tools to explore an art form called Op Art.<br />

            <ol>
                <li>Watch this animation to get a feel for how you will use your program to generate Op Art.<br />
                <img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/OpArt_img/OpArtAnimation.gif"  height="300" alt="" title="" /></li>
                <li>
                    Play with the program <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/optional-projects/5b-op-art-interactive.html">linked here</a> to get a feel for the type of tools you will be developing.  Initially the click-drag-release of the mouse is used to draw rectangles.  When you press the space bar, then the drawing phase ends and the mouse click becomes a paint bucket that fills bounded regions with paint.  Below you can see examples of phase 1 (drawing rectangles) and phase 2 (filling regions with color) of the program. <br />

        <p>The coding in this project is subtle and is all about correct sequencing that match the set of events that take place in the creation of the Op Art.  You will first build all the helper blocks that will help make your coding easier.
        </p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="second">
            <ol start="3">
                <li>
                    In phase 1, the drawing phase of the project, you will be drawing many rectangles from corner to diagonally opposite corner defined by the mouse click- drag-release.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/OpArt_img/corner12.png" height="150" alt="" title="" /><br />
                    So first, create a reporter block that will define a <code>corner</code> by storing the x and y coordinates of the corner in a list.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/OpArt_img/cornerxy.png"  height="100" alt="" title="" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create also the helper reporter blocks that allow you to retrieve the stored x and y values for a given corner.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/OpArt_img/xofcorner.png"  height="100" alt="" title="" />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/OpArt_img/yofcorner.png"  height="100" alt="" title="" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now create a reporter block that will define a rectangle by storing its two diagonally opposite corners in a list.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/OpArt_img/rectanglecorner12.png" height="100" alt="" title="" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now create a block that will draw a rectangle given its two defining corners.  The following blocks may help.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/OpArt_img/drawrectanglecorner12Hint.png"  height="200" alt="" title="" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now create some variables that will help you store and keep track of important information.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/OpArt_img/variables.png"  height="180" alt="" title="" /><br />
                    <var>drawingDone</var>: is a Boolean variable that takes values <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> and is used to keep track of which stage of the program (drawing or paintbucket) is on. It is initially <code>false</code> but when the space bar is pressed&mdash;which concludes the drawing phase&mdash;it is set to <code>true</code>.<br />
                    <var>rectangleList</var>: is a list that will store all the rectangles created so they can be redrawn after each screen refresh.<br />
                    <var>corner1</var>: variable to store the mouse x and mouse y values when mouse first clicked<br />
                    <var>corner2</var>: variable to store and update mouse x and mouse y values as the mouse is dragged until released.
                </li>
                <div class="sidenote">Try your best, but if you get stuck you can look at <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/optional-projects/5c-op-art-hints.html">this page</a> for some more information.</div>
                <li>Now you have all the helper tools you need to create the Op Art program.  It is recommended that you first write down the pseudocode detailing the sequence of events in the program and what should happen at each case before you build the actual code.</li>
                <li>
                    Use your Op Art tool to generate exciting works of art and take screenshots of your creations.  Share with your class and post them on your class website if you have one.<br />

                <li>It is possible to fully automate the painting phase by using the following algorithm: for every pixel on the screen find out inside how many rectangles it is enclosed.  For each pixel, the number of the enclosing rectangles will be either odd or even.  Color the pixel white if the number is odd and black if even (or vice versa.) To understand why this algorithm works, use paper and pencil to apply it to simple cases with few overlapping rectangles.  Write code to automate your Op Art generation.<br />
