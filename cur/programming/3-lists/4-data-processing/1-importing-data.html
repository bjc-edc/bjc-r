            <p>Brian, I'm definitely going to need some help thinking about how to cover the standards. I think most of DAT-2 goes here with the exception of DAT-2.B, which can go with what's currently 3.5.4. --MF, 6/7/19</p>

                        CSV stands for "comma separated values." CSV files are tables of data stored with commas between each item in a row and line breaks between each row in the table. (You can see the commas and line breaks if a CSV in a text editor.) If you want to see the data as a table, you can open the CSV file in a spreadsheets application like Google Sheets, Apple Numbers, or Microsoft Excel. Or you can process the data in Snap<em>!</em>

				<li>Open Snap<em>!</em> and drag the downloaded file into the Snap<em>!</em> window. You should see a table full of data. Look over the data including the <em>column headers</em> (labels) in the top row to give yourself a sense of what kind of information is included. Then click "OK" to close the window, and drag the new global variable from the Variables palette into the scripting area. This variable contains the data as you can see in the watcher on the Snap<em>!</em> stage.</li>

For example, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/" alt="map (item (1) over ()) over (cars)" title="map (item (1) over ()) over (cars)" /> reports just the MPG of every car in the CORGIS Cars CSV Library. The <code>map</code> function is simple to understand (e.g, add 3 to every item in the list, or take the fourth item of every record in the table), but it can take time and practice to learn when and how to use it. Encourage students to take that time by talking with their partner, referring back to <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-introduction-to-lists/4-mapping-over-list.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 3 Lab 1 Page 4: Transforming Every List Item">Unit 3 Lab 1 Page 4: Transforming Every List Item</a> where they first learned <code>map</code>, and/or talking to other pairs. </div>

                    <p>
                        Notice that these suggested block names include the word "table" before the second input.

Using <code>row () of table ()</code> on something that's not a table (even though it may not give you an error message right away) will give you something that isn't a table row, which can cause an error later on in your program.

                        You can use the <code>pipe</code> function from the "Frequency Distribution Analysis" library to work through your data analysis one function at at time:<br />

                        The <code>pipe</code> function sends the <var>cars</var> data through <code>keep</code> to filter it for just the Subarus, through <code>column (1) of table</code> to get just the "City MPG" for those Subarus, and finally through <code>average</code> to get the average of those Subaru MPG values.  
                    </p>
                    <p>Recall that the empty input slots in each function are filled by the output of the previous function (or the starting dataset in the case of the first function): the empty slots in the <code>keep</code> function are both filled by <var>cars</var>; the empty slot in <code>column (1) of table</code> is filled by the output of <code>keep</code>; and the empty slot in <code>average</code> is filled by the output of <code>column (1) of table</code>. It's like a pipe of made of pieces connected together; the data goes in one end and works through each function, computing a new value at each step.</p>
