        <h2>Contact List App: Name Order</h2>
        <p>Now you'll fix the name order issue: whether say the family name first and then the given names, or the given names first and then the family name. To do this, you will create two different types of contact: family-first and given-first. Each contact will be  represented as a list whose first item is a <strong>type tag</strong>, either the word "family-first" or the word "given-first." </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Load your contact list app from before; it should be saved as "U3L2-ContactList"</li>
                <li>Write two new constructors:<br />
                  <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/family-first.png" alt="family-first contact, name= () addr= () phone= ()"><br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/given-first.png" alt="given-first contact, name= () addr= (), phone= ()">
					<p>Both  should report a four-item list containing the type tag, the name, the address, and the phone number.</p>
            </li>
                <li>Decide how to present this choice in the user interface. You could have two buttons "Add family-first contact" and "Add given-first contact." Or you could have a single button that asks the user to enter the type (maybe with examples), and then  the name, address, and phone. Or.... <strong>Build the button(s) for the user interface.</strong></li>
                <li>
           	  Then create a new selector called <code>contact type</code> that takes a contact as input, and  reports its type tag. </li>
                <li>Now fix the address and phone number selectors to use the new contact structure. </li>
                <li>Finally, fix the two name selectors  to check the type tag and report the name properly: <div class="sidenoteBig" style="margin-top: 60px;"> Note: There's no comma in the sorting form of a family-first name; it's exactly the same as the display form.</div>
                  <table  border="1">
    <caption>Name forms vs. name types</caption>
    <tr>
      <th width="29%" scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
      <th width="34%" scope="col">display form</th>
      <th width="37%" scope="col">sorting form</th>
      </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">family-first type</th>
      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun Yat-Sen</td>
      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun Yat-Sen</td>
      </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">given-first type</th>
      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham Lincoln</td>
      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lincoln, Abraham</td>
      </tr>
  </table>
                 
                </li>
                <li>Clear your contact list, add some contacts of both types.</li>
                <li>Make sure the internal representation is what you expect, and then make sure that your <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/phone-number-of.png" alt="phone number of ()"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-from-number.png" alt="name from number ()"> blocks still work, without changing them at all.</li>
			</ol>
        </div>
<!--             <div class="takeItFurther">
            <ol type="A">
            <li>Put the sorting form of names to work by sorting your contact list. You've been given a <code>sort</code> block that takes a list as its first input, reporting a sorted version of the list. The second input to <code>sort</code> is a <em>comparison function</em> that takes two inputs, reporting <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true"> if one item comes before a second item. Here's how you'll use it in this project:<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sort-contacts.png" alt="sort (contact list) ordering with &lt;(name (sorting form) {}) &lt; (name (sorting form) {})&gt;"><br />The two list slots in the picture are supposed to stay empty.  Don't forget that <code>sort</code> is a reporter; you have to do something with the list it reports.</li>
