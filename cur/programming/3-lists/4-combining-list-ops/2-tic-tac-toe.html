    	<h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
    	<div class="todo">FROM:<a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=MrZG&ProjectName=U0301_ListsPrez">Zeph Grunschlag in NY</a>: "Your goal is to make a much more elegant version of the Tic Tac Toe board drawer that uses functions instead of duplicate blocks. Please notice link to "complicated" program. You don't need to re-drag all the blocks (see the link to a pre-written Snap! program). BONUS: If you can make your program especially short (script blocs + function blocks in total) I'll give you extra credit."</div>

		<p><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/4-abstraction/3-abstraction-developing-a-board-game.html">In Unit 2</a>, you developed the beginnings of a board game. In this lab, you will extend that project to build an app that lets two players play Tic Tac Toe. Later, you'll be able to teach the machine to play, too. </p>

			<ol>
                <li>Open your project <strong>U2L4-TicTacToe</strong> from Unit 2. Save it as <strong>U3L4-TicTacToe</strong> so that you'll still have the old version after you modify the project here. Play the game again, checking to make sure the sprite <em>centers</em> itself in each cell (tile) before stamping itself, as the animation  shows.</li>
                <li>
                    Build an abstract data-type called "move" to manage the player and the location of each move.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Build a constructor <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/current-move-constructor.png" alt="current move, player: () cell number: () reporter" title="current move, player: () cell number: () reporter" /> that takes two inputs, the player (<strong>x</strong> or <strong>o</strong>) and the number of the cell the player moved to (1 through 9), and it reports the list of those two.</li>
                        <li>
                            Build two selectors:
                            <ul>
                                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/player-from-move-selector.png" alt="player from move {} selector" title="player from move {} selector" /> that takes a move (a list like <code>{x, 5}</code>) as input and reports only the player (e.g., x).</li>
                                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/cell-number-from-move.png" alt="cell number from move {} selector" title="cell number from move {} selector" /> that takes a move as input and reports only the cell number (e.g., 5).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    How are going to call the constructor when the player makes a move by dropping the sprite? That is, what will the inputs be?
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We can determine which player is moving from the costume number. Make a reporter <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/justplayer.png" alt="player ()" title="player ()" /> that translates a costume number (1 or 2) into a player's symbol (<strong>x</strong> or <strong>o</strong>), so you can like this:<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/player(costumeNumber).png"  alt="player (costume Number)">
                        </li>
                        <li>We can use <code>which cell? </code> to find how which cell number the player is trying to move into.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                	The players can see which cells on the board have been taken, but the program isn't keeping track of those cells, so a player can move the sprite into a space that has already been taken.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>To keep track, you will need a variable <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/current-game-variable.png" alt="current game variable" title="current game variable" /> which will contain a list of moves created by the <code>move</code> constructor over the course of the game. Use <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/Make-a-variable.png"  alt="make a variable (in the variables palette)"> to make that variable. At the start of the game, this list must be empty (set to the empty list). </li>
                        <li>
                            When a player tries to move the sprite into a space, your program must check the list <code>current game</code> to see if that is a legal move. One way  is to create a <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/legal-move().png"  alt="legal move?"> predicate to test whether that cell is still free (not already used in <code>current game</code>). 
                            <ul>
                            	<li>
                                	The <code>legal move?</code> block can test against every move in <code>current game</code> with the expression below. (Note that <code>move</code> is the two-item list inputed into <code>legal move?</code>.)<br />
                            		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/map-cell-number-from-move()-over-current-game-contains-current-move.png" alt="map-cell-number-from-move()-over-current-game-contains-current-move">
                            	</li>
                            	<div class="commentBig">This used to say "the cell number that <code>current move</code> reports", but <code>current move</code> is a constructor; it's not going to report the current move, right? --MF</div>
                            	<li>If the intended move is a legal move, let the player move there and add the player's move—the list of either <strong>x</strong> or <strong>o</strong> and the cell number that <code>which cell?</code> reports—to <code>current game</code>.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
					</ol>
                </li>
				<li>Check to make sure your game works the way you want. Save your result.</li>
			</ol>
</div>
        
		<p>Your next step is to create a way to tell if a player's move has resulted in a win. You will need to experiment to find a way to do that.  Here are some suggestions.</p>
        
        
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
                <li> 
                    Each winning combination is a list of three cells. 
                    <ol>
                        <li>What triples are winning combinations?</li>
                        <li> How many winning combinations are there? </li>
                        <li>
                            Create a reporter that outputs a list of all possible winning combinations of cells. It will look something like this:<br />

                <li>Now reset your tic-tac-toe board so that the board is clear and the <code>current game</code> list is empty, and play <em>one</em> game, <em>deliberately letting</em> <strong>x</strong> <em> win the game</em>. </li>
				<li>
                	In order to invent a script that checks your board for wins, first experiment with these scripts. In each case, figure out <em>what</em> those results tell you about the game you just played, and figure out <em>how</em> that script  generated those results.
