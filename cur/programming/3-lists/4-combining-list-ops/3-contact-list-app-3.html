        <h2>Contact List App: Name Order</h2>
        <p>Now you'll revise your contact list app to fix the name order issue: whether to say the family name first and then the given name(s) or the given names first and then the family name.</p>
        <p>To do this, you will create two different versions of the contact constructor: family-first and given-first. Each contact will be  represented as a list whose first item is a <strong>type tag</strong>, either the word "family-first" or the word "given-first." </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Load your contact list app from before; it should be saved as <strong>U3L2-ContactList</strong>. Save it with the new name <strong>U3L4-ContactList</strong>.</li>
                <li>
                	Write two new constructors:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/family-first.png" alt="family-first contact, name= () addr= () phone= ()"><br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/given-first.png" alt="given-first contact, name= () addr= (), phone= ()">
					<p>Both should report a four-item list containing the type tag, the name, the address, and the phone number.</p>
            </li>
                <li>
                	Decide how to present this choice in the user interface, and implement your decision.
                    <ul>
                        <li>You could have two buttons "Add family-first contact" and "Add given-first contact." </li>
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/add-family-first-contact.png" alt="add family-first contact" title="add family-first contact" />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/add-given-first-contact.png" alt="add given-first contact" title="add given-first contact" />
                        <li>Or you could have a single button that asks the user to enter the type (maybe with examples) and then the name, address, and phone.</li>
                        <!-- This seems like the same thing as the first choice. --MF 
                        Or.... <strong>Build the button(s) for the user interface.</strong>-->
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Clear your contact list</strong> and add a few entries in the new format.</li>
                <li>So that your program can determine which type a contact is, create a new selector called <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/contact-type-selector.png" alt="contact type {} selector" title="contact type {} selector" /> that takes a contact as input and reports its type tag. </li>
                <li>Now, fix the address and phone number selectors to use the new contact structure. </li>
                <li>Finally, fix the two <code>name</code> selectors (<code>display-form</code> and <code>sorting-form</code>) to check the type tag and report the name properly: 
                  <div class="sidenoteBig" style="margin-top: 30px;"> Note: There's no comma in the sorting form of a family-first name; it's exactly the same as the display form. (Recall, in "Sun Yat-Sen" the family name is "Sun.")</div>
                  <table  border="1">
                    <caption>Name forms vs. name types</caption>
                    <tr>
                      <th width="29%" scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
                      <th width="34%" scope="col">display form</th>
                      <th width="37%" scope="col">sorting form</th>
                      </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <th scope="row">family-first type</th>
                      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun Yat-Sen</td>
                      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun Yat-Sen</td>
                      </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <th scope="row">given-first type</th>
                      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham Lincoln</td>
                      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lincoln, Abraham</td>
                      </tr>
                  </table>
                 
                </li>
                <!-- I moved this up so the new contacts can be used to test blocks --MF
                <li>Clear your contact list, add some contacts of both types.</li>-->
                <li>Make sure everything works (including the internal representation of <code>contact list</code>) is what you expect, and then make sure that your <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/phone-number-of.png" alt="phone number of ()"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-from-number.png" alt="name from number ()"> lookup blocks still work, and make changes as needed.</li>
			</ol>
        </div>
<!--             <div class="takeItFurther">
            <ol type="A">
            <li>Put the sorting form of names to work by sorting your contact list. You've been given a <code>sort</code> block that takes a list as its first input, reporting a sorted version of the list. The second input to <code>sort</code> is a <em>comparison function</em> that takes two inputs, reporting <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true"> if one item comes before a second item. Here's how you'll use it in this project:<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sort-contacts.png" alt="sort (contact list) ordering with &lt;(name (sorting form) {}) &lt; (name (sorting form) {})&gt;"><br />The two list slots in the picture are supposed to stay empty.  Don't forget that <code>sort</code> is a reporter; you have to do something with the list it reports.</li>
            </ol></div>  -->
