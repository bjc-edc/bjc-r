        <p><strong>Big data</strong> is a common term that describes <em>extremely large data sets</em> used to discover patterns in human behavior, interactions, and health as well as in environmental science and many other fields. Large data sets can be overwhelming to analyze, but computer software tools can help researchers extract information, identify trends, make connections, and solve problems with big data.</p>
