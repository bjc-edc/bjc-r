    	<h2>Implications of AI</h2>
        <div class="todo">From BJCx: How do you feel about the advancements in Artificial Intelligence that are allowing computers to continue to be better than humans in so many activities?  Do you believe (as many do) that machines will eventually challenge us (and in the worst case, take over), or will they hit an upper-limit and never develop to that point? --MF, 12/17/16</div>

                        The "uncanny valley" is a term that describes the eerie feeling when we realize that something we thought was human is not actually human.

                    Bias and AI: Because machine learning algorithms use existing data to develop "understanding" of the world, they are influenced by exisiting biases in the data. Research this issue and discuss how AI researchers might overcome this problem.
