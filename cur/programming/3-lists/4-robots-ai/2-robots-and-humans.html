				<p>Marina Bers is known for her work on computational thinking, technology, and tools for children to learn computer programming.  After receiving her undergraduate degree from Buenos Aires University in Argentina, she went on to earn a PhD from the MIT Media Laboratory in 2001, was a professor at Tufts University for 21 years and joined Boston College in 2022. <br><br>
				Dr. Bers co-developed ScratchJr, an app which teaches programming to children as young as age 5.  Dr. Bers is also a co-founder of KinderLab Robotics, where she developed KIBO, a robot that young children can program with wooden blocks.
