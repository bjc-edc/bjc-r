<!--<p><br>You may have played Geography, the game in which one player says 
a place name and the next player has to name another place whose first 
letter is the last letter of the previous place: Newark, Kentucky, 
Yonkers, San Francisco, Oklahoma. Have you ever gotten stuck on the 
letter "A"? Oklahoma, Alabama, Asia, Alaska, America, Alameda... and so 
on, forever.</p>

How many states start and end with the same letter? To find out, we first need a list of all the states. -->

		<p>Alphie and Betty discuss using <code>keep</code>: <img title="KEEP ITEMS SUCH THAT (&lt;predicate&gt;) FROM (list)" alt="KEEP ITEMS SUCH THAT (&lt;predicate&gt;) FROM (list)" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep_block.png" border="0"/></p>
	
		<div class="dialogue">
			<div><span>Alphie:</span> Let's figure out how <code>keep</code> works. Which states do we want to keep?</div>
			<div><span>Betty:</span> Let's get a list of the states that begin and end with the same letter.</div>
			<div><span>Alphie:</span> So the list we're using is <code>states</code>. And letter 1 of the word needs to be the same as the last letter of the word.</div>
			<div><span>Betty:</span> Ok, so far we have this.</div>
				<div class="stagedir"><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep_letter1equalsletterblank.png" alt="keep(letter_1=letter_blank)from(states)" title="keep(letter_1=letter_blank)from(states)"/></div>
			<div><span>Alphie:</span> We want the last letter of each word. The last letter depends on the length of the word.</div>
			<div><span>Betty:</span> Oh, right, so we can do this.</div>
				<div class="stagedir"><img title="keep(letter_1=letter(length))from(states)" alt="keep(letter_1=letter(length))from(states)" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep_letter1equalsletter(length)from(states).png" /></div>
			<div><span>Alphie:</span> Each item of <code>states</code> goes in the empty spaces. So, let's try an example. I'll pick a state - "new york". Letter 1 of "new york" is "n".</div>
			<div class="sidenote">The space in "new york" counts as a character. So "new york" has a length of 8 and the eighth letter is "k".</div>	
			<div><span>Betty:</span> And that equals... Well, length of "new york" is 8, and letter 8 of "new york" is "k". The condition is false because "n" doesn't equal "k". So "new york" doesn't show up in the list. We'll keep only the states that have the same first and last letter.</div>

                            Define a block that will keep all the states that start with a given letter. Here's an example of the block in action:<br />

		<p>A <strong>database</strong> is a list of <em>records</em>. Each record is a list of its own (the "data" for that record). For example, a database of people in New York might consist of records that contain first name, last name, address, and phone number. To be useful, a database needs <strong>selectors</strong> that pull out individual pieces of information from each record.</p>

				<li><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Discuss how <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code>might be useful in selecting and organizing data from a database.</li>

						<li>
							Make a database with data from your class. Each record contains first and last names, age (in years), and heght (in inches). So, your database might start out like this:<br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/database.png" alt="data_from_class" title="data_from_class" />
                            <div class="todo">This data entry is going to be time consuming. Maybe just "data from your pair and another pair"? -MF</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							Make your selectors. You need four of them; you could call them 
 <code>firstname</code>, <code>lastname</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>height</code>. Here's how <code>age</code> might work:<br />
 							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/agesel.png" alt="age_sasha" title="age_sasha" />
						</li>
						<li> 
							Search your database and create a list of all classmates who are...
							<ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
								<li>The same age as you</li>
								<li>Taller than you</li>
								<li>Younger than you</li>
							</ol>
						</li> 
						<li> Search your database and create a list of all classmates whose...
							<ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
								<li>Last name has the same first letter as yours</li>
								<li>First name starts with a letter that comes before yours in the alphabet</li>
