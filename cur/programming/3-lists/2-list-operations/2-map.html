<br><br>
The first input to the <code>map</code> block has a form you haven't seen before this:<br>
<img border="0" title="the MAP block" alt="the MAP block" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/mapblock.png"/>

</p>
<p>The grey ring means that the input should be a <i>function</i>. What we mean by this is basically the same thing as the <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)=3<i>x</i>+7 kind of function in algebra, except that it doesn't have to be a numeric function. In this case the function we want is &quot;join the letter 's' after the given word.&quot; When you drag the <code>join</code> block into the <code>map</code> input slot, the grey ring is still visible, to remind you that the input is a function, not the word that you'd get from some particular <code>join</code>ing.
  </p>
<p>Instead of using a variable, like the <i>x</i> in <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>), to represent the input to the function, we leave one of <code>join</code>'s input slots as an empty box. This is supposed to remind you of the notation 3&times;&#x2610;+7 (&quot;three times box plus seven&quot;) that you learned for functions in elementary school before you knew about variables.

</p>
<p><br><b>Try this:</b> Modify your <code>noun phrase</code> block so that half the time it uses a plural noun. Note that, if you use a plural noun, the article has to be &quot;the,&quot; rather than &quot;a.&quot;

        <div class="sidenote">The first input of <code>map</code> <img border="0" title="the MAP block" alt="the MAP block" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/mapblock.png"/> goes inside a gray ring, which means the input is a <em>function</em>.<br> <code>map</code> is called a <em>higher order function</em> because it takes another function as an input.</div>

		<p>Alphie and Betty talk about another example of using <code>map</code> to compute some function of every item of a list:</p>    
        <div class="dialogue">
    		<div><span>Betty:</span> That gray ring after the word "map" means a function goes in there. A function? Like in algebra? What about the function <em>f</em> defined by <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) = 3<em>n</em> + 7?</div>
            <div>
            	<span>Alphie:</span> Well, I don't think the function has to be mathematical. We used <code>plural</code> with words. But let's try to put the function <em>f</em> in there. First I need to build <em>f</em>.  Here you go:<br />
            	<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/deff.png" alt="f(n)=3n+7" title="f(n)=3n+7"><br />
            	Then we map <em>f</em> over a list, like 2, 0, and 7:<br />
                <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/fpict.png" alt="f(n)=3n+7" title="f(n)=3n+7"><br />
                and it works!
            </div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> But I think I see an easier way. There's no need to <em>name</em> <em>f</em>. We leave the input in the expression blank, just like we did in <code>join</code>.</div>
            <div class="stagedir">Betty makes and clicks to see <img border="0" title="map 3x+7" alt="map 3x+7" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/map3x+7.png" /></div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Let's see. 2 times 3 is 6. And then add 7. That's 13. Good, it worked!</div>

<div class="comment">JK: Comment from Dan and NY teachers: "They worked for quite a while, not realizing that if the function passed to map is “item _ of LIST” that they could remove the 1 to leave a blank slot.  This has come up before with students who see a drop-down menu and don’t realize it can be edited."</div>
        
        <li><strong>Make</strong> a red block, <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/lookup_block.png" alt="red reporter: lookup items () from ()" title="red reporter: lookup items () from ()" />. Here's how it starts:<br> <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/lookup_block_def.png" alt="lookup items (item numbers) from (this list)" title="lookup items (item numbers) from (this list)" /><br>And here it is in action on our list <code>nouns</code>:<div class="sidenote">If you need some inspiration, look again at <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-list-operations/getting-started.html#fmap">problem 3 in the Getting Started</a> for this lab.</div><br><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/nouns.png" alt="giraffe, elephant, pizza, etc." title="giraffe, elephant, pizza, etc." /> <br> <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/lookup_result.png" alt="lookup items (1,2,5) from (nouns) = (giraffe, elephant, boy)" title="lookup items (1,2,5) from (nouns) = (giraffe, elephant, boy)" /></li>
        
        <li>Once you've made <code>lookup items () from ()</code>, go to the file menu <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File button"/> and choose "Export blocks...". This opens a window with all the imported tools and all your custom blocks. <strong>Uncheck</strong> all the blocks <strong>except</strong> your new <code>lookup</code> block. Choose "ok."<br> You will see a new tab open with text. Save this as "lookup.xml" (go to your browser's File->Save Page As... or right-click on the page and Save As...). Save it to a folder or on your computer's desktop.<br>Now, you can use this block in other <span class="snap">snap</span> projects. Try it now. Open a new <span class="snap">snap</span> page. Then <strong>drag</strong> the "lookup.xml" file onto the <span class="snap">snap</span> page. The block should now be in your Variables palette.<br>You will use the <code>lookup</code> block again later in Unit 3 Lab 4.</li>
