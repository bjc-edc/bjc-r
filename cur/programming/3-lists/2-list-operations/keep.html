<!--<p><br>You may have played Geography, the game in which one player says 
a place name and the next player has to name another place whose first 
letter is the last letter of the previous place: Newark, Kentucky, 
Yonkers, San Francisco, Oklahoma. Have you ever gotten stuck on the 
letter "A"? Oklahoma, Alabama, Asia, Alaska, America, Alameda... and so 
on, forever.</p>

How many states start and end with the same letter? To find out, we first need a list of all the states. -->

        <div class="sidenote">Notice that this grey ring's inner boundary is hexagonal, which means you should use a <i>predicate </i>function, which is a function that reports <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</div>
    
        <p>Alphie and Betty discuss using <code>keep</code>: <img title="KEEP ITEMS SUCH THAT (&lt;predicate&gt;) FROM (list)" alt="KEEP ITEMS SUCH THAT (&lt;predicate&gt;) FROM (list)" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep_block.png" border="0"/></p>
    
        <div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Let's figure out how <code>keep</code> works. Which states do we want to keep?</div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> Let's get a list of the states that begin and end with the same letter.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> So the list we're using is <code>states</code>. And letter 1 of the word needs to be the same as the last letter of the word.</div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> Ok, so far we have this.</div>
            <div class="stagedir"><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep_letter1equalsletterblank.png" alt="keep(letter_1=letter_blank)from(states)" title="keep(letter_1=letter_blank)from(states)"/></div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> We want the last letter of each word. The last letter depends on the length of the word.</div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> Oh, right, so we can do this.</div>
            <div class="stagedir"><img border="0" title="keep(letter_1=letter(length))from(states)" alt="keep(letter_1=letter(length))from(states)" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep_letter1equalsletter(length)from(states).png" /></div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Each item of <code>states</code> goes in the empty spaces. So, let's try an example. I'll pick a state - "new york". Letter 1 of "new york" is "n".</div>
            <div><span>Betty:</span> And that equals... Well, length of "new york" is 8, and letter 8 of "new york" is "k". The condition is false because "n" doesn't equal "k". So "new york" doesn't show up in the list. We'll keep only the states that have the same first and last letter.</div>
            <div class="endnote">The space in "new york" counts as a character. So "new york" has a length of 8 and the eighth letter is "k".</div>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Define a block that will keep all the states that start with a given letter. Here's an example of the block in action:

                <li>Write an expression that will select all the states whose names are at least seven letters long.</li>
                <li>Write an  expression so that it selects the states whose first letter is a vowel: <img title="KEEP(vowels_contains_blank)from(states)" alt="KEEP(vowels_contains_blank)from(states)" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/keep_vowelsfromstates.png" border="0" /></li>
