<code>Combine with</code> is most useful with only the following six functions:<br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sum.png" alt="sum block" title="sum block" />
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/product.png" alt="product block" title="product block" />

<p><br>Let's say you have a list of numbers, such as all the students' grades on a quiz. You want to find the average grade. There are two steps: First, add up all the numbers; then divide that sum by the number of numbers &#45 that is, by the length of the list.<br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/average.png" alt="average uses COMBINE WITH +" title="average uses COMBINE WITH +"/>
<br>
Notice that the red <code>length</code> <code>of</code> block that finds the number of items in a list is different from the green <code>length of</code> block that finds the number of letters in a text string.

<br><br>
The first input to the <code>combine with</code> block is a <i>two-input </i>function. In this case, it's the <b><code>+</code></b> block, because we want to add all the numbers. In fact, unlike the situation with the <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> blocks, there are really only a handful of functions you'll ever use with <b>combine</b>:<br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/bad-operators.png" alt="+, *, and, or, join, join words" title="+, *, and, or, join, join words"/>
</p>
Why did we include the addition and multiplication operators, but not subtraction or division? Using an operator with <code>combine</code> makes sense only if it doesn't matter whether the values are combined left to right or right to left. That is,
<br>
3+(4+5) = (3+4)+5
<br>but
<br>3-(4-5) &ne; (3-4)-5

<p><br>
  Very occasionally you'll define a two-input custom reporter for use with <code>combine</code>.

The two-input <code>max</code> block is an example; try using that to find the largest of a list of numbers.<b><br>
</b><br>
We should try out the <code>average</code> block:<br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/avg781.png" alt="average of the list 7,8,1 iw 5.333333" title="average of the list 7,8,1 iw 5.333333"/>
<br>Is that the answer you'd expect?<br><br>
