<h2>Combine With</h2>

<!---<div class="todo">
	<ul>
    	<li>BH: I'm not sure I like the first exercise.  The fact that you can use the same value in more than one input slot with map is an obscure secondary feature; I'd rather kids see that map expects a single input slot, whereas combine requires (exactly) two input slots.  I'm too tired right now to try to craft an alternative, though.  :-(</li>
        <li>JK's response: We have kids find squares of numbers earlier in the lab so they've seen it... Maybe the new sidenote below helps enough that we can keep the problem?</li>

	<div class="sidenote">Note that these are all <em>two-input</em> functions.</div>
  <p><code>Combine with</code> is most useful with  functions that take two inputs like:<br>
  <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sum.png" alt="sum block" title="sum block" />
  <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/product.png" alt="product block" title="product block" />
  <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/join_two_blanks.png" alt="join block" title="join block" />

  <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/or.png" alt="or predicate block" title="or predicate block" />or  the <code>max</code> function that you defined above.</p>

 <!--- <div class="comment">JK: BH says "The join words example in the orange box is really confusing.  It has to be join words (join words (the) (cat)) (sat) = join words (the) (join words (cat) (sat))" But I think that's more confusing. You're allowed to put phrases in join words... I'd like to keep it as is... Any other opinions out there?</div>--->

These operations are <em>associative</em>, which means that the result is the same no matter how the items are grouped. For example, (3 + 4) + 5 = 3 + (4 + 5) and <code>join words</code>("the cat")("sat") = <code>join words</code>("the")("cat sat"). <br>
You are allowed to drag other blocks such as <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/difference.png" alt="difference block" title="difference block" /> or <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/quotient.png" alt="quotient block" title="quotient block" />, and you'll get an answer, but it may not be what you expect. In general, don't use subtraction and division because the grouping of the items matters in these cases. For example, (3 - 4) - 5 &ne; 3 - (4 - 5). <!--The expression <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine_minus_345.png" alt="combine with (subtraction) 3,4,5" title="combine with (subtraction) 3,4,5" /> actually gives the result of 3 - (4 - 5).-->

<!--<p><br>Let's say you have a list of numbers, such as all the students' grades on a quiz. You want to find the average grade. There are two steps: First, add up all the numbers; then divide that sum by the number of numbers &#45 that is, by the length of the list.<br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/average.png" alt="average uses COMBINE WITH +" title="average uses COMBINE WITH +"/>
<br>
Notice that the red <code>length</code> <code>of</code> block that finds the number of items in a list is different from the green <code>length of</code> block that finds the number of letters in a text string.

<br><br>
The first input to the <code>combine with</code> block is a <i>two-input </i>function. In this case, it's the <b><code>+</code></b> block, because we want to add all the numbers. In fact, unlike the situation with the <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> blocks, there are really only a handful of functions you'll ever use with <b>combine</b>:<br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/bad-operators.png" alt="+, *, and, or, join, join words" title="+, *, and, or, join, join words"/>
</p>
Why did we include the addition and multiplication operators, but not subtraction or division? Using an operator with <code>combine</code> makes sense only if it doesn't matter whether the values are combined left to right or right to left. That is,
<br>
3+(4+5) = (3+4)+5
<br>but
<br>3-(4-5) &ne; (3-4)-5

<p><br>
  Very occasionally you'll define a two-input custom reporter for use with <code>combine</code>.

The two-input <code>max</code> block is an example; try using that to find the largest of a list of numbers.<b><br>
</b><br>
We should try out the <code>average</code> block:<br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/avg781.png" alt="average of the list 7,8,1 iw 5.333333" title="average of the list 7,8,1 iw 5.333333"/>
<br>Is that the answer you'd expect?<br><br>
