<code>Combine with</code> is most useful with only the following six functions:<br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sum.png" alt="sum block" title="sum block" />
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/product.png" alt="product block" title="product block" />
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/join_two_blanks.png" alt="join block" title="join block" />
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/join_words_two_blanks.png" alt="join words (2 blanks)" title="join words (2 blanks)" />
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/and.png" alt="and predicate block" title="and predicate block" />
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/or.png" alt="or predicate block" title="or predicate block" /><br>
These operations are <em>associative</em>, which means that the result is the same no matter how the items are grouped. For example, (3 + 4) + 5 = 3 + (4 + 5) and <code>join words</code>("the cat")("sat") = <code>join words</code>("the")("cat sat"). <br>
You are allowed to drag other blocks like <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/difference.png" alt="difference block" title="difference block" /> or <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/quotient.png" alt="quotient block" title="quotient block" />, and you'll get an answer, but it may not be what you expect. In general, don't use subtraction and division because the grouping of the items matters in these cases. For example, (3 - 4) - 5 &ne; 3 - (4 - 5). The expression <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine_minus_345.png" alt="combine with (subtraction) 3,4,5" title="combine with (subtraction) 3,4,5" /> actually gives the result to 3 - (4 - 5).

<ol start="2">
	<li><div class="sidenote">average<br>= (sum of numbers) / (number of numbers)</div>
    Edit the block definition for <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/average_grades.png" alt="average(grades)" title="average(grades)" /> to report the average of a list of grades. Use your block to find the average of <code>numbers</code>.</li>
    <li>Make a block <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/max_of.png" alt="max of () and ()" title="max of () and ()" /> that returns the higher of two inputs. Use this operation in <code>combine with</code> with <code>numbers</code>. Does it behave as you expected?</li>
</ol>
</div>






<!--<p><br>Let's say you have a list of numbers, such as all the students' grades on a quiz. You want to find the average grade. There are two steps: First, add up all the numbers; then divide that sum by the number of numbers &#45 that is, by the length of the list.<br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/average.png" alt="average uses COMBINE WITH +" title="average uses COMBINE WITH +"/>
<br>
Notice that the red <code>length</code> <code>of</code> block that finds the number of items in a list is different from the green <code>length of</code> block that finds the number of letters in a text string.

<br><br>
The first input to the <code>combine with</code> block is a <i>two-input </i>function. In this case, it's the <b><code>+</code></b> block, because we want to add all the numbers. In fact, unlike the situation with the <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> blocks, there are really only a handful of functions you'll ever use with <b>combine</b>:<br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/bad-operators.png" alt="+, *, and, or, join, join words" title="+, *, and, or, join, join words"/>
</p>
Why did we include the addition and multiplication operators, but not subtraction or division? Using an operator with <code>combine</code> makes sense only if it doesn't matter whether the values are combined left to right or right to left. That is,
<br>
3+(4+5) = (3+4)+5
<br>but
<br>3-(4-5) &ne; (3-4)-5

<p><br>
  Very occasionally you'll define a two-input custom reporter for use with <code>combine</code>.

The two-input <code>max</code> block is an example; try using that to find the largest of a list of numbers.<b><br>
</b><br>
We should try out the <code>average</code> block:<br>
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/avg781.png" alt="average of the list 7,8,1 iw 5.333333" title="average of the list 7,8,1 iw 5.333333"/>
<br>Is that the answer you'd expect?<br><br>
