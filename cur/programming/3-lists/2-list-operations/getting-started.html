        <div class="comment">JK: BH says this: "TiF 2:  It would be better if the example were more sensible somehow; in this example the outer map undoes the work of the inner one.  Maybe if the outer one were length of []?" But then in the meeting, he mentioned that this is an example where there are two blanks that map fills that make sense to have. Anyway, I left it in for now.</div>

The first input to the <code>map</code> block has a form you haven't seen before this:<br>
<img border="0" title="the MAP block" alt="the MAP block" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/mapblock.png"/>

</p>
<p>The grey ring means that the input should be a <i>function</i>. What we mean by this is basically the same thing as the <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)=3<i>x</i>+7 kind of function in algebra, except that it doesn't have to be a numeric function. In this case the function we want is &quot;join the letter 's' after the given word.&quot; When you drag the <code>join</code> block into the <code>map</code> input slot, the grey ring is still visible, to remind you that the input is a function, not the word that you'd get from some particular <code>join</code>ing.
  </p>
<p>Instead of using a variable, like the <i>x</i> in <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>), to represent the input to the function, we leave one of <code>join</code>'s input slots as an empty box. This is supposed to remind you of the notation 3&times;&#x2610;+7 (&quot;three times box plus seven&quot;) that you learned for functions in elementary school before you knew about variables.

</p>
<p><br><b>Try this:</b> Modify your <code>noun phrase</code> block so that half the time it uses a plural noun. Note that, if you use a plural noun, the article has to be &quot;the,&quot; rather than &quot;a.&quot;
