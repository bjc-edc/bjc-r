        	<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will develop a Contact List database application like the one on your phone.</p>

			<p>An <strong>abstract data type</strong> (ADT) is a custom data type that's meaningful to your program.

                    Write the <em>selector</em> blocks to retrieve the <code>name from contact</code>, <code>address from contact</code>, or <code>phone from contact</code>.

                        <p>It's important to make sure that your inputs to a function match the expected input type. For example, the input type of <code>address from contact</code> matches the output type of <code>contact</code>; they are both of type "contact."</p>
                        <p>If you call <code>address from contact</code> with an input that doesn't match, such as a <em>list</em> of contacts (for example, the <var>contact list</var> variable or the result of running <code>keep</code> and having a subset of that list), it's not going to work. That may sound obvious, but in fact, beginning programmers make mistakes like that all the time; you have to teach yourself to think about the input  and output types of your functions every time you write or use one. </p>
                        <p>That's also true about the inputs to the <code>contact</code> constructor; you can't put something that isn't a name in the name input for <code>contact</code>.</p>

                            It's somewhat artificial to use the constructor as the input to a selector; these images are just examples to show what the selectors should be able to do when given a contact as input. In <em>your</em> program, the selectors will take an item from the contact list as input and output the correct piece of that contact, like this:<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/address-from-contact-item-1-of-contact-list-reporting.png" alt="address from contact (item (1) of (contact list)) reporting '123 Main St. #4, New York, NY 10001'" title="address from contact (item (1) of (contact list)) reporting '123 Main St. #4, New York, NY 10001'" />
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
		        <li>
                    Declare input types for each selector to make it obvious that they expect a list (one whole contact) as input.<br />
