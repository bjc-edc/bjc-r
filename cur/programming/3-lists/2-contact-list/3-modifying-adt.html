                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop an abstract data type (ADT) to store and access <em>dates</em>, and you will adapt your contact ADT to use it to store each contact's birthday.<br />

            <p>As we add more complexity to contacts&mdash;birthday, work address, and so on&mdash;the location of each data point (such as the phone number) inside a contact might change. This is where an abstract data type helps. If you were to move the phone number as you refine your contact ADT, you <em>could</em> fix every single block that uses the phone number, or if you have an ADT, you could just fix the one <em>selector</em> that chooses the phone number from the list. With that one change, all the other blocks using that selector will get the data they need automatically.</p>
