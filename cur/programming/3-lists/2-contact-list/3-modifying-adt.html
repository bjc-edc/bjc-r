		<h2>Adding Birthdays</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p><strong>Purpose (do/learn; why this/here):</strong> Extend the ADT by adding a <code>date</code> ADT, adapting the <code>contact</code> ADT to accept it, and adding more helper blocks.</p>
            <p>Can we cut all the commented out text on this page? --MF, 7/22/19</p>
            <p>MARY: change the DATE ADT to use the correct ADT format. --MF, 5/23/20</p>
            <p>BRIAN: as a low priority (that is, after ALL the solutions for all units and all optional projects are done), you want to add a "parse a date" TIF. --MF, 5/23/20</p>
        </div>

        	<p>
                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop an abstract data type (ADT) to store and access <em>dates</em>, and you will adapt your contact ADT to use it to store each contact's birthday.<br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/contact-constructor-with-birthdate.png" alt="contact with name: ... birthday: (date (July) (9) (2005))" title="contact with name: ... birthday: (date (July) (9) (2005))" />
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="takeNote">
            <p>As we add more complexity to contacts&mdash;birthday, work address, and so on&mdash;the location of each data point (such as the phone number) inside a contact might change. This is where an abstract data type helps. If you were to move the phone number as you refine your contact ADT, you <em>could</em> fix every single block that uses the phone number, or if you have an ADT, you could just fix the one <em>selector</em> that chooses the phone number from the list. With that one change, all the other blocks using that selector will get the data they need automatically.</p>

        <div class="ap-standard">AAP-1.D.5</div>
        <p>Notice that name, address, and text are strings, but birthdate is a list. You can combine elements of different types in a list. </p>

                	Create an ADT to manage three data points for each date: <var>month</var>, <var>day</var>, and <var>year</var>.

                        <li>
                            Create a <code>date</code> <em>constructor</em> that accepts this data as input and then reports a date as a list of three items. <br />

                            Edit the <code>contact</code> constructor block definition to accept a birthdate as a list by using the <code>date</code> constructor. <br />

                                        Another way is to use <em>abstraction</em> and create another helper, <img class="inlinde" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/ask-birthdate.png" alt="ask birthdate" title="ask birthdate" /> that reports a list of the user's answers to these prompts:

                                            <li>What is the contact's birth month?</li>
