        <div class="todo">From Observation Notes Analysis: U3L4: "There is time being wasted creating list {list{_,_,_}, list{_,_,_}, list{_,_,_}, list{_,_,_}, list{_,_,_}, list{_,_,_}, list{_,_,_}, list{_,_,_}} Handling the block input slots and expander arrows is a time sink." [This note was from Magic Squares, which is now gone, but it's worth being mindful of elsewhere.]</div>

			Here are three lists of lists: one is a list of world capitals and their countries; one is a list of showtimes on the four screens of a movie theater; and one is a to-do list with categories:<br />

            <div><span>Betty:</span> First, the sprite goes to (200,-20). So when <code>i</code> is 1, the sprite glides to (item 1 of item 1, item 2 of item 1). Then when <code>i</code> is 2, the sprite glides to (item 1 of item 2, item 2 of item 2. And then it goes to the third and fouth points too.</div>
            <div><span>Morgan:</span> Since these are lists, I wonder if there's a way to use <code>for each</code> instead of <code>for</code>...</div>
