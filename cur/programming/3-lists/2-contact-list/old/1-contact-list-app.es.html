        <p>All cell phones have some kind of Contacts list. In this lab, you will build a Contacts app yourself.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/old/U3L2-ContactList.xml">this starter version</a> of the app.</li>
                <li>Press the "Add Contact" button on the stage, and read the script to understand how it works. Each new contact is a list (item 1 is a name and item 2 should be a phone number), so the list of contacts is a <em>list of lists</em>.</li>
                <li>Fix the <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-phone.es.png" alt="get phone"> block so that it works similarly to <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-name.es.png" alt="get name">.</li>
				<li>Clear your contact list and add a few made-up people to make sure everything works.</li>

                	Dan had some thoughts on this next section that we implemented but then reverted. Here are the edits that were made and removed:
                    	<ul>
                            <li>Write a reporter <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/phone-number-of.es.png" alt="phone number of ()"> that takes any part of a person's name as input, and reports a list of all the phone numbers of the people whose names match. You will need:</li>
                            <li>(instead of <code>empty</code>) c. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/map.es.png" alt="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" title="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" />, which performs a function over each item of the list.</li>
                        </ul>
                    The problem with these unimplemented edits was that they required more complicated programming than is appropriate for this point in the curriculum. It would, of course, be nice if the program handled the case of multiple search results better than just returning the first one, and that should be addressed at a later point. --Aug 2016
                </div>
                <li>
					Write a reporter <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/phone-number-of.es.png" alt="phone number of ()"> that takes any part of a person's name as input, and reports that person's phone number, or "not found" if the name is not in the contact list. You will need:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/string-contains.es.png" alt="&lt;string () contains ()&gt;">, which lets you find out whether one string (a contact's name in the list) contains another string (a name or part of a name).</li>
                        <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.es.png" alt="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" title="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" />, which filters the list for only the items that make the function true.</li>
						<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/empty.es.png" alt="is 'list input slot' empty?" title="is 'list input slot' empty?" />, which returns <code>true</code> if the list is empty and <code>false</code> otherwise.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>When someone calls you, the phone company sends only the calling number to your phone, not the person's name. But if the number is in your contact list, your phone  figures out the name. So you'll also want a block<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-from-number.es.png" alt="name from number ()"> that searches for a phone number and reports the contact's name.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.es.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work" /> Make sure everything works the way you want it to before going on.  Then save!
                
		<div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="7">                       
				<li>
					<!--<div class="sidenote">In some cultures, the family name—the one you  use for alphabetizing—is written first. For example, in "Sun Yat-Sen" the family name is "Sun." So instead of asking for "first and middle name(s)" and for "last name" you might want to say "given name(s)" and "family name."</div> -->
					Our starter version of the app uses a single text string to hold a person's entire name. This is fine for displaying the name on the screen but makes it hard to display a list of all contacts <em>sorted by last <!--family--> name.</em> So we really want to keep the last <!--family--> name separate from the first <!--given--> name(s).
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Modify the <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-name.es.png" alt="get name"> block so that it asks separately for first <!--given--> names and for last <!--family--> name and then reports a list of the two answers. Check to make sure that adding a new contact does what you expect. </li>
						<li><strong>Clear your contact list</strong> and add a few entries in the new format.</li>
                        <li>Write two reporters that take a contact as input and report the name as a text string, in two different orders:<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-display-result.es.png" alt="name (display form) --&gt; Abraham Lincoln" title="name (display form) --&gt; Abraham Lincoln"><br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-sorting-result.es.png" alt="name (sorting form) --&gt; Lincoln, Abraham" title="name (sorting form) --&gt; Lincoln, Abraham"><br />
                        <!--(Don't worry, yet, about how to handle family-name-first names. We'll get to that soon.)--></li>
                        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-mini.es.png" alt="Save Your Work" title="Save Your Work" />
                        <li>Check whether your <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/phone-number-of.es.png" alt="phone number of ()"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-from-number.es.png" alt="name from number ()"> blocks still work. Use your <code>name (display form)</code> selector to fix any problems.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			You will soon make more improvements to this app, after addressing the idea of <em>abstract data types,</em> which you'll need when we return to the contact app.</div>
