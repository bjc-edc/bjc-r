            <strong>On this page,</strong> you will adapt your <code>contact</code> constructor to accept various ADTs for <code>name</code>.

        <div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> Right now, our program uses <em>one</em> text string to hold each contact's name, but people have multiple names.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> That's ok; we can still search them.</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> It's fine for displaying names on the screen, but it would make it hard to <em>sort the contacts by last name</em>.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> We could use another list to separate the last name from the first name.</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> If we change the ADT though, we'll have have to adapt all the blocks that use it...</div>
			<div><span>Betsy:</span>That's fine. Instead of one selector to access the name, we can make two selectors: one to report the name the way we'll display it on the screen: first-name last-name; and one to report the name the way we'll sort it with an algorithm: last-name comma first-name.</div>

				<li>
					<!--<div class="sidenote">In some cultures, the family name—the one you  use for alphabetizing—is written first. For example, in "Sun Yat-Sen" the family name is "Sun." So instead of asking for "first and middle name(s)" and for "last name" you might want to say "given name(s)" and "family name."</div> -->
                    Modify the "Add Contact" script (editing the <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-name.png" alt="get name" title="get name" /> block, if you built one) to distinguish between the these two orders. Your script should:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ask separately for first <!--given--> name(s) and for last <!--family--> name.</li>
                        <li>Add a contact to <var>contact list</var> where the name is a list of two items.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Investigate how this new contact works. How does it appear in the list? Do any blocks or scripts not work anymore?</li>
                <li>
                    In place of your one <code>contact name</code> selector, create two new selectors to distinguish between these two orders.

                <li>Clear your contacts list, and add a few entries in the new format. Check to make sure that adding a new contact does what you expect.</li>
