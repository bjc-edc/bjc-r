                <p>Brian, I cut the test you were referring to and totally restructured this content, but I'm keeping your comment for transparency. Unless you think we still need this comment, please remove this whole TODO. Thanks! --MF, 6/27/20</p>
                <li>In the revision, to follow the idea of projects first, this section should come at the beginning, and the page heading should be "Acronym Generator," and things like Unicode and each individual HOF should be introduced as it's needed, e.g., Unicode to help distinguish capitals from lower case. --bh</li>
                <p>An <strong>acronym</strong> is a "word" made up of the first letters of every capitalized word in a phrase. For example, the acronym for United States of America is USA, and SUNY is an acronym for State University of New York.</p>
                <p>In this project, you will create a reporter block that takes a phrase as input and reports an acronym made <em>only from the capitalized words</em>. It should work like this:<br/>

For example:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/map-example-2.png" alt="map (join( )(s)) over (list {cat, dog, bird}) reporting {cats, dogs, birds}" title="map (join( )(s)) over (list {cat, dog, bird}) reporting {cats, dogs, birds}" /><br />

		<div class="takeNote">
            <p><strong>You choose the function that describes the change, and <code>map</code> applies that function to each item in the input list and then reports the list of changed values.</strong></p>
            <p>Notice that the function mapped over the list always has a blank input slot. This is where the list item goes each time the function is performed.</p>

        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
            <p>A <strong>higher order function</strong> is a function that takes a function as input. Like <code>keep</code> and <code>combine</code>, <code>map</code> is a higher order function.</p>

        <h3>Creating an <code>Abbreviate</code> Block</h3>        
        <p>
            Computers store keyboard characters (capital and lowercase letters, punctuation marks, space, digits, symbols, and so on) as numbers called Unicode. Unicode assigns a number to every letter that can be typed in any language, as well as to special characters, such as !, @, #, &ouml;, &lambda;, &clubs;, and the space bar. This table shows the Unicode for some of the keyboard characters:<br />
            <div class="sidenote">The full list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters#Latin_script" target="_blank">Unicode characters</a> is much longer.</div>

        </p>
        <p>
            In Snap<em>!</em>, the <code>unicode of</code> block reports the number that is used for a particular character:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/img_CaesarCipher/SnapUnicode1.png" height="52" alt="unicode of (a) reporting '97'" title="unicode of (a) reporting '97'" /><br />
            The <code>unicode as letter</code> block reports the character that a given Unicode number represents:<br /> 
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/img_CaesarCipher/SnapUnicode2.png" height="52"  alt="unicode (65) as letter reporting 'A'" title="unicode (65) as letter reporting 'A'" />

                    To create an <code>abbreviate</code> block, you need a way to identify which unicode numbers represent capital letters.

            <p>The orange oval blocks that name variables are reporters, like other oval blocks.  But <em>most</em> reporters implement <em>functions,</em> which means that when you call the same block with the same inputs, you always get the same value. <code>2+3</code> is always 5. The <code>random</code> block, and reporters you write using <code>random</code>, are different; calling them twice with the same inputs may report different answers.</p>
            <p>Variable blocks are one step further away from functions; a program can choose to change the value that a variable block will report by using <code>set</code> or <code>change</code> to give the variable a new value.</p>

            <p> It turns out that any program that changes the values of variables can be rewritten in a way that doesn't <code>set</code> or otherwise change the values of variables. There are advantages to this <em>functional programming</em> style, which avoids certain kinds of otherwise-common bugs, but some kinds of programs are hard to write functionally. You aren't really ready to think about this yet, but we'll come back to functional programming later in the year.</p>

            <li>Ben suggests that the results will be more convincing in the form of a list containing that total and all the names of the people in that category (paid less than $100,000, for example). So, if there are five people in that category, your list will have six items: first the total of the salaries, and then the names of the people. Try this both for less than $100,000 and for more than $100,000.
