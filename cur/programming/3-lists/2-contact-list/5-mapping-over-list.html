                        In one case, <code>split</code> is focusing on the exact characters in the string. In the other case, it's giving you what you really want: the words in the contact's name. At a low level of abstraction, text is made of characters and you look through each of the characters. But at a higher level of abstraction (such as when you are reading), text is made up of words. Snap<em>!</em> lets you think at this higher level of abstraction.

For example:<br />

                    This is the list of employees of a small company. Each of the smaller lists contains a person's name, job title, and yearly salary.
                    <p>"This company spends more money on the big bosses than on the people who do the work," says Alyssa one day.  Is she right?  Write an expression to compute the total salaries of everyone paid less than $100,000 per year.  Then find the total for everyone paid more than $100,000 per year.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Ben suggests that the results will be more convincing in the form of a list containing that total and all the names of the people in that category (paid less than $100,000, for example). So, if there are five people in that category, your list will have six items: first the total of the salaries, and then the names of the people. Try this both for less than $100,000 and for more than $100,000.</li>
