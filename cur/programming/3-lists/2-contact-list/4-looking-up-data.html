        <p>As you add more contacts to your list, it will become less and less realistic to find the one you want by reading through the whole list. So building a search feature will become essential for finding the desired information efficiently. Lists, adding and removing items from lists, and searching lists are common features in many programs.</p>

			<p>Farida Bedwei (born in 1979) is a software engineer and the co-founder/Chief Technology Officer of Logiciel, a financial technology company based in Ghana. Due to difficulties in muscle control as a result of cerebral palsy, she began using a typewriter as an alternative to writing at an early age. Badwei attributes  her future interest in computers to this early reliance on technology.  In addition to being named as one of the most successful women in finance technology in Africa, Bedwei is a powerful advocate and role model for girls in STEM and for people with disabilities.</p>

			    <li>Write a predicate function that takes two contacts as inputs.  It should return True if the first contact belongs before the second one in a sorted contact list. That is, you'll have to extract the names (in sorted form) from the two contacts, and then use <code>&lt;</code> to compare them.  Respect the data abstractions.</li>
			    <li>
                    Make a block to sort the contact list.  To do the actual sorting, you can load the "List utilities" library.  It has a block
				    <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/sort-block.png" width="242" alt="sort 'list input slot' ordering with 'predicate input slot'" title="sort 'list input slot' ordering with 'predicate input slot'" />.
                    Use the contact list as the first input.  The second input should be the predicate function you just wrote. (Leave its two input slots empty.)  The <code>sort</code> block will report a new, sorted contact list.

                    We've been sloppy so far in talking about name formats. Most people in the United States say their given name (the one their parents chose for them) first, and their family name last.  But in China, for example, the family name comes first. So "Sun Yat-sen" is a member of the Sun family.
                    <ul>
                        <li>How should the name "Sun Yat-sen" be displayed to the user?</li>
                        <li>How should "Sun Yat-sen" look in order to sort contacts by family name?</li>
                        <li>What about someone with a middle name, such as Martin Luther King?  Is the middle name a family name or a given name?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
				<li>
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
				    Here's the tricky part:  To make this all work correctly, a name (as defined by the <code>name</code> ADT) has to know whether it's a given-first name such as Betsy Anderson or a family-first name such as Sun Yat-Sen.  <strong>Redefine your Name ADT</strong> to make it a list of <em>three</em> items.  The first will be either the text 'given-first' or 'family-first'.  This first item is called a <em>type tag.</em>  The second item will be the given name (or names), and the third will be the family name (or names).
                    <div class="endnote">
                        You've been using type tags all along without knowing it. Many programming languages, including Snap<i>!</i>, attach type tags to every value, saying "I am a list" or "I am a number" and so on.  The user (i.e., you) doesn't see the type tags, unless you provide a bad input to a primitive block, and you see a message like "Expecting list but getting text."
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
                    <strong>Reading a name:</strong> Find where you ask the user for first and last name, and change the code to ask for given name(s) and family name.  Also ask which comes first. You might want to have two name constructors, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/given-first-constructor.png" alt="contact name, given-first, from given: () family: ()" title="contact name, given-first, from given: () family: ()" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/family-first-constructor.png" alt="contact name, family-first, from given: () family: ()" title="contact name, family-first, from given: () family: ()" />.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" /><strong>Writing a name:</strong> Modify your  <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-display-form-from-contact.png" alt="name, display form, from contact 'list input slot" title="name, display form, from contact 'list input slot" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-sort-form-from-contact.png" alt="name, sort form, from contact 'list input slot'" title="name, sort form, from contact 'list input slot'" /> so that they check the type tag of the name (the first item) when necessary. Be careful about when to add a comma.
                </li>
				<li>
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
				    Make sure your <code>find contacts</code> block and your sorting of the contact list still work with a contact list containing both kinds of names.
