    	<h2>Remembering the Moves</h2>
        <div class="todo">This comment box applies to both pages of the lab.
            <p><strong>Why at all?</strong> This lab
        introduces <code>map</code> and gives practice in using HOFs to do interesting analysis.  It also lays the groundwork for later strategy computation.</p>        
            <p><s>As a side benefit, this lab gives an opportunity to talk about how two very different solutions to the U2 TTT problem are interchangeable here provided they implement the same API, namely providing the <var>board</var> list.</s></p>
            <p><strong>Why here?</strong> This unit is about lists, HOFs, and functional programming, all of which are exercised in this lab.  In particular, this lab replaces the former one with a page per HOF.</p>
            <p>This very short page could possibly be combined with the next, to make a one-page lab<s>, but there's a definite shift in focus between thinking about ties and thinking about wins</s>.</p>
        </div>

    	<div class="learn">
            <p><strong>In this lab</strong>, you will continue <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-abstraction/4-building-tic-tac-toe.html">the tic-tac-toe project</a> from Unit 2 to allow the program to <em>analyze</em> the game board to detect wins and ties.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll prepare for the analysis by giving the program a global memory of what moves have been made.</p>

        <!--
<div class="takeNote">In Unit 2, you may have done either or both of two versions of the tic-tac-toe project: the 
<a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-abstraction/4-building-tic-tac-toe.html">one-sprite version</a> in Lab 4 and the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/optional-projects/4-tic-tac-toe.html">nine-sprite version</a> in the optional projects.  Each version has different virtues:
<ul>
<li>In the one-sprite version, it took some calculation to find out which square the player moved into, but very little extra effort to check for illegal moves and to collect the result of all moves in one place.</li>
<li>In the nine-sprite version, knowing which square was automatic, because the player moved by clicking a different sprite for each square.  Detecting illegal moves was also easy because each sprite knew the state of one square. But collecting the moves in one place  required sending messages between sprites.</li></ul>
There's no obvious better choice between the two.
<p><em><strong>Both versions</strong></em><strong> end up with a global variable <var>board</var> whose value is a nine-item list representing the current state of the game board.</strong> As a result, you can now build on either version in this lab.</p></div>

<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
                <li>Open your project <strong>U2L4-TicTacToe</strong> and save it as <strong>U3L2-TicTacToe</strong>. That preserves the old version while you modify it here.</li>
                <li>
                    It was easy to detect illegal moves (a move in a square that's already occupied) because each sprite could test that without knowing anything about the board as a whole. But for the analysis in this lab, you need a <em>global</em> picture of the state of the game. (It's "global" not just in the sense of using a global variable, although that's true too, but rather that you need one single idea of the board, not nine local ideas about one square each.)
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            Make a global variable <var>board</var> and, when the game starts, set it to a list containing the word "Empty" nine times.<br />

                            <div class="narrower" style="background-color: #e4cde3;">Alternatively, write a recursive function you can use this way: <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/copies-of.png" alt="(9) copies of (Empty)"></div>
                            As the game progresses, you're going to record each move by modifying this list, so that its value always reflects the actual state of the visible board.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Create a <strong>sprite-local variable</strong> <var>square number</var>:<br />
                            <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/square-number-var.png" alt="variable name dialog box with 'for this sprite only' selected" title="variable name dialog box with 'for this sprite only' selected" /><br />
                            A sprite-local variable is like a global variable in that it doesn't belong to a particular <em>script,</em> but it does belong to a particular <em>sprite.</em>  When the initial sprite is cloned nine times, each clone will have its own version of this variable.  That's how a sprite will "know" which square it is on the board.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As you create the clones, give each the correct <var>square number</var>:<br />
