People get rich on ideas, but you can't eat ideas, and the supply of real stuff isn't infinitely expandable, so in effect real stuff becomes more expensive for people not in the virtual-stuff business.</div>

                        <li>Name some jobs that don't exist today that you think might exist in 25 years.</li>

 <p>Until recently, many economists argued that jobs lost through automation would be replaced by new jobs controlling the machinery. Recent research has established that the number of new technology-control  jobs is too small to make up for the jobs replaced by the technology. There <em>are</em> new jobs available, but they're not as good as the old ones; they are some or all of part-time, low-pay, short-term, or without benefits such as health insurance.</p>
