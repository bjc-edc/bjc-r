            	<li>Here are some ways employers use technology to monitor their employees. What are some pros and cons of these policies?
                <ul>
                	<li>Block access to certain websites, like social media  (like Facebook or Twitter), game sites, or other sites they deem inappropriate or offensive.</li>
                    <li>Monitor email use of employees, including reading email messages.</li>
                    <li>Use video surveillance to prevent theft.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>On-demand businesses existed before the Internet, but technology has helped grow an ''on-demand economy.''   Many  on-demand companies  do not have regular employees, but  hire independent contractors. This gives workers great flexibility about when they work, but costs them  benefits   like sick pay, health insurance, collective bargaining, job stability, or unemployment insurance if they are fired.
                  <ul>
                	<li>Research  the on-demand economy. Here are some resources to get you started.

                      <ul>
                    	<li>On-demand workers know what they're signing up for, so they shouldn't be suing these companies for not getting benefits.</li>
                        <li>In general, you get better work out of people if they are dedicated and loyal to your company. Might it matter if a driver drives for both Uber and Lyft?</li>
                        <li>The on-demand economy just helps the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.</li>
                        <li>It is hard for a traditional company with employees to compete with the on-demand model.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Think of an idea for an on-demand company you might launch.</li>
