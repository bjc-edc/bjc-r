    	<h2>GPS Forensics: Visualizing Data</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>GH Feedback:</strong> I'm not sure what the case is, or what the students are being directed to do. What are examples of hypotheses they might have? What is the situation?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>Let's go to <span class="snap">Snap</span> and visualize the data.</p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/data/gps-digital-forensics.xml"> gps-digital-forensics starter project</a> to get started.  You'll see that the stage has a nice grid for a background image, and the sprite has a circle costume to stamp coordinates with.</li>
                <li>Now get the GPS coordinates into a <span class="snap">Snap</span> list. You'll need separate numbers for each longitude and latitude, so each element of your main list of data should be a list with two entries (one for each coordinate).</li>
                <li>There is an example script in the starter project that draws a dot at <code>50</code>, <code>50</code>.  Use your list of data to draw each coordinate on the screen.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Now, that you've visualized the data, discuss with your peers:</p>
        <p>Do you have any hypotheses for the case?</p>
        <p>How could you test them?</p>
