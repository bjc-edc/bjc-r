        <p>Now that you know that the average length differs,  build a simple classifier based on the number of words in a particular message. That is, write a block that takes in a message and, based on how many words it contains, returns either "ham" or "spam" as its classification.</p>
     
        <div>
        	<img class="center" alt="classify a message that evaluates to HAM"
        src="/bjc-r/img/data/classify-by-number-of-words-HAM.png"><br />
	        <img class="center" alt="classify a message that evaluates to SPAM"

        </div>

        <p>Implement in <span class="snap">snap</span>, and use it to classify the messages in our data.  You can use a regular loop to call your classify on the second item in each row of the data, or you might use this <i>faster</i> method using <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="the keep block">:</p>

        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/data/count-number-of-spam-messages-with-custom-classify.png" alt="using keep to apply a custom classify method to the data" title="using keep to apply a custom classify method to the data" />

        <div>
            <p>Answer the following questions:</p>
            <p>Play around with different <i>threshold values</i>&mdash;that is, the number of words above which you decide that a message is spam.</p>
            <p>What was the best threshold you found?</p>
            <p>How many messages did it classify incorrectly?</p>
