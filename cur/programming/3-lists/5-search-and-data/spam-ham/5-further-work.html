        <p>What else could you do to improve the spam filtering?</p>
        <p>Discuss this with your team.  You might consider the following options:
            <ul>
                <li>Detect spam by finding phone numbers or web links</li>
                <li>Detect spam by finding words that are highly frequent in spam messages and not in ham messages</li>
                <li>Detect spam by checking with a dictionary for clean spelling and no abbreviations</li>
                <li>Combine several methods</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Compare your solutions with the one you wrote earlier (using average number of words)?  Which would do better?  Why?</p>
