    	<h2>GPS Data</h2>
        <p>Big Burgers is coming to New York City, and asked people to share their location to decide where to put their new restaurants.</p>

        <p>Hundreds of people have shared their locations through GPS coordinates.</p>

        <div class="sidenote">Locations in this format are called <i>Decimal Degrees</i>:<br /> DDD.DDDD&deg; (latitude, north or south of the Equator), DDD.DDDD&deg; (longitude, east or west of the Prime Meridian through London). <br /> If you search for "40.748817, -73.985428" in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/40%C2%B044'55.7%22N+73%C2%B059'07.5%22W/@40.7488051,-73.9854167,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>, you can see the corresponding location, near the Empire State Building.</div>

        <p>Here are some of the coordinates (need to change these):</p>

	<div class="sidenote">It's not necessary, but if you are interested, read the following quick introduction on how GPS coordinates work: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2209240_read-gps-coordinates.html">E-How Tutorial on GPS coordinates</a>.</div>
        <p>The data given to you are 10 GPS coordinates, which can be used to determine a location on the Earth. Each row is a separate coordinate, consisting of two numbers, a latitude followed by a longitude. 
        </p>
        
    
    <p>
    Most computer based mapping systems display this format for GPS coordinates. Positive values of latitude are north of
    the equator, negative values to the south. <em>Most</em> programs (not all) use negative values for west longitude.
    </p>
    
    
    <h3>Making the data useful</h3>
    
    <p>GPS data isn't very useful as a list of numbers; the data is far more useful if we can visualize it. Here are the coordinates as a list of lists:<br />
    <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3Lab5GPS.xml"><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/gps_coords.png" alt="set (coordinates) to {{37.869050, -122.272050}, etc}" title="set (coordinates) to {{37.869050, -122.272050}, etc}" /></a><br />
    When you open the project, you will see that the background of the stage is set to an <em>x</em>-<em>y</em> grid and that the sprite's costume is a black circle.</p>
    
    <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
    <ol>
    	<li>Write a script to plot the coordinates on the graph. Use <code>stamp</code> to plot the points.<br />
        When you run your script, you should see this:<br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/gps_badpic.png" alt="graph with only one point around (37, -122)" title="graph with only one point around (37, -122)" /></li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Transform the data</h3>
    
    Transform these GPS coordinates into coordinates that will display nicely on this <em>x</em>-<em>y</em> grid. These  problems will go through one way to do this (there's more than one way).
    
    <div class="forYouToDo">
    <ol start="2">
      <div class="sidenoteBig">Yes, subtracting -122.27 is the same as adding 122.27.</div>
      <li>Every <em>x</em>-coordinate starts with "37.86" and every <em>y</em>-coordinate begins with "-122.27". This information is not helping us tell the points apart. Subtract 37.86 from every <em>x</em>-coordinate and subtract -122.27 from every <em>y</em>-coordinate, <strong>using a higher-order function</strong>.</li>
      <li>Now the first <em>x</em>-coordinate is 0.009050. There are many choices we could make to turn this into a "nicer" number. One choice is to multiply every <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-coordinate by 1000000 (that's one million). Adjust your higher-order function to do this calculation as well.</li>
      
      <div class="sidenoteBig">Making Snap<em>!</em> do the work is better, because then the program can be used on <em>any</em> set of GPS points in this area, and not just these. That's abstraction.</div>
      <div class="sidenoteBig">Recall that you made a block called <code>average</code> in <a href="http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-list-operations/combine.html">Lab 2 ("Combine with")</a>.</div>
      <li>Now the first <em>x</em>-coordinate is 9050, which we still can't see on the grid. Let's center the coordinates around the <em>average</em> <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-coordinate. Subtract the average of all the <em>x</em> values from each of the <em>x</em>-coordinates, and subtract the average <em>y</em> values from each of the <em>y</em>-coordinates. You can find the  average on a calculator, <strong>or even better</strong>, make Snap<em>!</em> do the work.</li>
      <li>Once you have these transformed coordinates, use your script from problem 1 to graph the points.</li>
    </ol>
