    	<h2>GPS Data</h2>

        <p>
            A computer forensic specialist who works for a law enforcement agency might analyze GPS (global positioning system) data.
        </p>

        <p>
            You have a set of GPS coordinates from a device the suspect used to communicate during the time of the crime. Use them to reconstruct the movements of the perpetrator.
        </p>

        <div class="sidenote">Locations in this format are called <i>Decimal Degrees</i>:<br> DDD.DDDDD&deg; (latitude), DDD.DDDDD&deg; (longitude)<br> If you search for "37.873808, -122.254173" in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/37%C2%B052'25.7%22N+122%C2%B015'15.0%22W/@37.873808,-122.254173,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0m" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>, you can see the corresponding location, near the Greek Theater on the campus of U.C.

	<div class="sidenote">It's not necessary, but if you are interested, read the following quick introduction on how GPS coordinates work: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2209240_read-gps-coordinates.html">E-How Tutorial on GPS coordinates</a>.</div>
        <p>The data given to you are 10 GPS coordinates, which can be used to determine a location on the Earth. Each row is a separate coordinate, consisting of two numbers, a latitude followed by a longitude. 
        </p>
        
    
    <p>
    Most computer based mapping systems display this format for GPS coordinates. Positive values of latitude are north of
    the equator, negative values to the south. <em>Most</em> programs (not all) use negative values for west longitude.
    </p>
    
    
    <h3>Making the data useful</h3>
    
    <p>GPS data isn't very useful as a list of numbers; the data is far more useful if we can visualize it. Here are the coordinates as a list of lists:<br>
    <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/3-lists/U3Lab5GPS.xml"><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/gps_coords.png" alt="set (coordinates) to {{37.869050, -122.272050}, etc}" title="set (coordinates) to {{37.869050, -122.272050}, etc}" /></a><br>
    When you open the project, you will see that the background of the stage is set to an <em>x</em>-<em>y</em> grid and that the sprite's costume is a black circle.</p>
    
    <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
    <ol>
    	<li>Write a script to plot the coordinates on the graph. Use <code>stamp</code> to plot the points.<br>
        When you run your script, you should see this:<br><img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/gps_badpic.png" alt="graph with only one point around (37, -122)" title="graph with only one point around (37, -122)" /></li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Transform the data</h3>
    
    Transform these GPS coordinates into coordinates that will display nicely on this <em>x</em>-<em>y</em> grid. These  problems will go through one way to do this (there's more than one way).
    
    <div class="forYouToDo">
    <ol start="2">
      <div class="sidenote">Yes, subtracting -122.27 is the same as adding 122.27.</div>
      <li>Every <em>x</em>-coordinate starts with "37.86" and every <em>y</em>-coordinate begins with "-122.27". This information is not helping us tell the points apart. Subtract 37.86 from every <em>x</em>-coordinate and subtract -122.27 from every <em>y</em>-coordinate.</li>
      <li>Center the coordinates so they can be visualized in an x/y-coordinate 
        system. Data can be easily centered by subtracting
        the mean of the data from all data points. <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
