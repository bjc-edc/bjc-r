        	On this page, you'll work with a dataset on a classroom of 27 sixth-graders. You will create a graph of height vs. weight, showing the boys and girls in different colors that also allows you to examine individual datapoints to see their approximate values, like this:<br />

                    Look in the Variables palette for this dataset on a classroom of 27 sixth-graders: <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/Gr6-age-height-weight-gender-stats.png" alt="Gr6-age-height-weight-gender-stats" title="Gr6-age-height-weight-gender-stats" />. Each data point in this set contains <em>four</em> items:

                    Your graphing app was written to expect only <em>two</em> numbers in each datapoint. Will it even work with this dataset? Try it. What does it do?

                <li>
                    Create custom blocks that report:

                    Create a block that takes a list of numbers as input and reports the <em>average</em> value.

                <li>Create a block, <code>female data</code>, using <code>keep</code>, that reports a list containing all the datapoints of only the girls, and another block, <code>male data</code>, that does the same for the boys.</li>
                <li>You now have everything you need to create a graph of height vs. weight, showing the boys and girls in different colors that also allows you to examine individual datapoints to see their approximate values, as shown in the animation above. Build it.</li>

                    Use the tools you have built to create a few separate graphs: age against height or weight, height against weight, separated or not separated by gender—and <em>also mark the averages</em> in each case. What can you say about this particular class based on the data?
                </li>
                <li>You probably needed to reset the window scale for some of these graphs. Searching through the data to find the lowest and highest values can be a nuisance. Create tools to do that for you. </li>
