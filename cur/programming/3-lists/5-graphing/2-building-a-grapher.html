        <h2>Building a Graphing App (Teacher's Choice)</h2>
        <div class="learn">On this page, you will explore tools that scale the default Snap<em>!</em>  stage to allow graphing of a set a data points.</div>
        <p>
            Plotting a single point, given its two coordinates, should feel this simple:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/plotpointxy.png"  height="225" alt=""/>
            
		</p>
        <p>Then you could graph a whole list of data points by inventing a block like <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/Graph datapoints.png" height="40" alt=""/> that uses <code>for each</code> to apply <code>plot point</code> to each point in the list. Depending on the kind of graph you want, you could even connect the dots.</p>
		<p>
        	That seems like all you should need. But what if the <em>scale</em> of your data does not fit on the Snap<em>!</em> stage (between -240 and 240 in the <em>x</em> direction and between -180 and 180 in the <em>y</em> direction)? <br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/SnapStageCoordinates.png"  height="300" alt=""/><br />
            
            For example, what if you want to plot the popularity of a baby name over time, like this?<br />
            
        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/PercentageOfDerekByYear.png" height="300" alt="percentage of births named Derek by year" title="percentage of births named Derek by year" />
        </p>
		<p>The <em>x</em>-values can't be plotted because they are completely off of Snap<em>!</em>'s stage. And the <em>y</em>-values 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc., are so close to each other that they would all look the same. We wouldn't see the huge increase in popularity between 1960 and 1980 at all. <br />
        We need a way to <em>convert</em> between the default Snap<em>!</em> &nbsp <strong>Stage Coordinates</strong> and the <strong>Graph Coordinates</strong> for a given set of data points.

            5.2.1 error (I think) in yellow side comment.
            It claims that this procedure is state invariant: "Notice that the last block
returns the sprite to its original location. This keeps the block state
transparent—leaving things where they are when you started." But that's not true:

to PlotPoint x: (x) y: (y)
go to scaled point x: (x) y: (y)
pendown
move (1) steps
penup
move (-1) steps

It totally doesn't go back to the sprite's original location! There may be a
good reason to leave the sprite at the desired point rather than one step away,
but state transparency isn't the reason.
</div>
            <div class="comment">It's <em>not</em> state transparent!  That would be if it remembered the point where the sprite was before running this block.  It just leaves the sprite someplace predictable.</div>

This keeps the block <em>state transparent</em>&mdash;leaving things where they are when you started.
