        <h2>Building a Grapher</h2>
        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong>, you will learn how to scale values so that you can graph any data set on the Snap<em>!</em> stage. Blocks to do the calculations are already written for you but you can, if you like, examine them to see how they work.</div>
        <p>
            Plotting a single point, given its two coordinates, should feel this basic:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/plotpointxy.png"  height="225" alt=""/>
            
		</p>
        <p>Then you could graph a  list of data points by inventing a block like <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/Graph datapoints.png" height="40" alt=""/> just like your work in Unit 2 Lab 2. Depending on the kind of graph you want, you can  connect the dots or not.</p>
		<p>
        	That seems like all you should need. But what if the <em>scale</em> of your data does not fit on the Snap<em>!</em> stage (between -240 and 240 in the <em>x</em> direction and between -180 and 180 in the <em>y</em> direction)? For example, what if you want to plot the popularity of a baby name over time, like this?<br />

        </p>
		<p>The years can't be plotted on the horizontal because those values are completely off  Snap<em>!</em>'s stage. And the percent values 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc., are so close to each other that they would all look the same. We wouldn't see the increase in popularity between 1960 and 1980 at all. 
        We need a way to <em>convert</em> between Snap<em>!</em> &nbsp; <strong>stage coordinates</strong> and the values—we'll call them the <strong>graph coordinates</strong>—for a given set of data points.

                <li>1b,c, and d really confused my students, but when they got to 3 they were able to do it pretty easily. I think the naming of the reporter blocks was confusing, and the exploration had unclear goals.

                <li>I think the PlotPoint at the top of the page is supposed to use go to, not go to scaled point. Otherwise step 4 becomes redundant.</li>
                <li>In #3, where did all the gridlines come from?</li>
                <li>Students get confused in #3 when the variable has a &quot;#&quot; after it, and the variable below it in the block does not</li>

                    Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/U5L2-GraphingApp.xml">this Snap<em>!</em> project.</a> It contains several blocks already built for your convenience.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Click  the <code>set window scale</code> block with the inputs it already has (-2, 4, 30, 300) to see what it does. In addition to drawing on the screen, it sets several variables that your other blocks will need so that they know the intended screen dimensions. </li>
                        <li>
                            Experiment with inputs to these two blocks to get them to report 0.<br />

                            How do your input numbers relate to the window scale?
                        </li>
                        <li>Use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/go-to-x-(stage-coord-for-x)-y-(stage-coord-for-y).png" alt="go-to-x-(stage-coord-for-x)-y-(stage-coord-for-y)" title="go-to-x-(stage-coord-for-x)-y-(stage-coord-for-y)" />  with those same input numbers. Where does it put the sprite?</li>
                        <li>Without changing the sprite's position, click <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/x-value-at-stage-coord(x-position) .png" alt="x-value-at-stage-coord(x-position) "> and explain the result you get.</li>
                        <li><div class="sidenoteBig">For this graph, a sprite at the bottom right corner of the stage should say (4, 30), not (240, -180).</div> Now create a script that tells the sprite to say its correct <em>graph</em> coordinates (not its <em>stage</em> coordinates).  </li>
                        <li>Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-I-am-dropped.png" alt="When I am dropped"> block with your new script so that when you move the sprite around, it says its <em>graph</em> coordinates wherever it is dropped.</li>
                        <li>
                            <div class="todo">I made some changes here including changing "(0,0)" to "around." I wasn't sure what was intended before though. Is this ok? -MF</div>
                            Now, change the inputs of <code>set window scale</code> to (1927, 2014, 0, 0.5) and click it to reset the scale of the screen. Check to see if your sprite says what you expect when you move it around the stage.<br />

Please review as I'm not 100% sure I interpreted your intentions correctly. --MF</div>Experiment with various inputs to <code>set window scale</code> to see where it puts the axes and how it represents the &quot;substitutes&quot; for the axes, when the axes can't be shown. Then, change the inputs of <code>set window scale</code> back to (1927, 2014, 0, 0.5).</li>
                <li>
                	Build <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/go-to-scaled-point-x-y.png" alt="go to scaled point">. 
                    <p>On the baby name graph for Derek, the point (1971, 0.25) is roughly in the middle of the screen.  Check to see if <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/go-to-scaled-point-x(1971)-y(0.25).png" alt="go-to-scaled-point-x(1971)-y(0.25)"> is working as you expect it to.</p>

				</li>
                <li>Then, build <code>PlotPoint</code> so that it uses  <code>go to scaled point</code> instead of plain <code>go to</code>. Check it to make sure it works as you expect it to.</li>
                <li>
                	Finally, build <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/GraphDatapoints.png" alt="Graph datapoints (pointlist)"> to make a dot at every datapoint, but <em>not</em> to connect the points (for now). Apply it to <code>DerekData1927to2015</code>. Your graph won't be connected and won't have labels, and it will fill the whole stage, but it should otherwise look like the graph above.<br />
