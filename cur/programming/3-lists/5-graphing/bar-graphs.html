        <h2>A Tool for Creating Bar Graphs</h2>
        <div class="learn">  
        	<p>
            	<strong>In this project,</strong> you will create a data visualization tool general enough to generate bar graphs for a multitude of data sets.  You will deepen your understanding of abstraction and gain practice with Higher Order Functions such as <code>map</code>.<br />

        <li>Open this starter project.  You are given some blocks. Note that the first block is a <em>constructor</em> of a new ADT (Abstract Data Type) called <code>data</code>.  The second and the third are the <em>selectors</em> for the new ADT.  The last block finds the largest element of a list. Explore them and understand how they work.<br />

<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/BarGraph_img/axiswithMinMax.png"  height="150" alt=""/>
</div>
        </li>
 
   


  
<li>Create a block that draws the x and y axis given the minimum and maximum x and y values.  There should not be any labels or tick marks at this point.<br />

<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/BarGraph_img/drawAxis.png"  height="45" alt=""/>
<!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/BarGraph_img/axis.png"  height="150" alt=""/>-->


</li>
 

         
<li>You are given this <code>label</code> block.  Explore how it works, especially by changing the location and direction of the drawing sprite.<br />
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/BarGraph_img/labelofsize.png"  height="45" alt=""/></li>
 
<li> Create a <code>put label</code> block that will place a label of a given size, at the desired x, y location, oriented in the given direction.  Note the orientation directions should follow Snap!’s convention for directions (0<sup>o</sup> up, 90<sup>o</sup> right, 180<sup>o</sup> down, 270<sup>o</sup> left).  Here is an example of labels with the four directions.  These four blocks should produce the following:<br />
  
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/BarGraph_img/putlabelChina.png"  height="150" alt=""/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/BarGraph_img/ChinaLabels.png"  height="200" alt=""/>


 
</li>



<li>Now create a block that will draw a vertical bar at the given x, y location of desired width and height with the given label underneath the bar.

 
This should produce:
 
Be sure that you have “Flat Line Ends” selected form the Settings menu to draw rectangular bars.  You can see the difference in two types of lines drawn.
                        
</li>

<li>Now create a block that will create a series of bars starting from a xMin and yMin location with a desired bar width and maximum bar height for a given data input.
 

This block with the given inputs should produce something like:

</li>
 <div class="endnote">
Note that given a maximum bar height, the heights of all the bars can be computed as a fraction of this maximum bar height.  For example, if maximum bar height=240 and we want to find how tall the bar for USA should be, we first find the largest value in the data set which is 8715 (from China) and do the following computation
USA bar height=240 ∙(USA Value)/(Maximum Value)=240 ∙5491/8715≈151

While finding the maximum of the data values, first we get a list of values and then apply the max of list function.  The following block which uses the selector “get value” will produce a list of values from the given data list.
 </div>

<li>Now create a block that labels the y-axis based on desired x, y locations and data input.

 
It should create labels like this:
          
For simplicity, you can assume that the y-axis will always be partitioned into 10 equal parts for labeling purposes.

</li>
<li>Now you are ready to put everything together and create a “Bar Graph” drawing block for a given data input.  Fill in the blanks.
 
When everything is done, the following code,

 
should produce a bar graph as shown below:
 
Your coding should be general enough to accommodate a new set of data input such as:
 
</li>
<div class="sidenote">
Note: “per capita” means “per person”.  So, for example for China, you take the total CO2 emissions and divide by the population:
8715*106 metric tons/1.337 109persons=6.52 metric ton/person
</div>
 
<li>Compare the two bar graphs.  What insights does each graph provide about CO2 emissions? Is one better than the other?</li>


<li>Now collect some data in your class or from the internet on a topic you care about that would lend itself to visualization with a bar graph.  Use your Snap! program to visualize your data.</li>
        </ol>
       
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeItFurther">
Sometimes it is more convenient to present your bar graph with horizontal bars instead of vertical ones.  Modify your code so that it takes an input indicating which type of bar graph (horizontal or vertical) is to be generated.
