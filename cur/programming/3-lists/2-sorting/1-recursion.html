<h2>Walking Down a List</h2>
    <div class="learn">
<strong>In this lab</strong> you will sort your contact list alphabetically by name.<br />
<strong>On this page</strong> you will use <em>recursion</em> to examine the items of a list one by one.</div>
<p>You've already used the<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item-1-of.png" 
alt="item (1) of ( )"> block to look at a single item from a list. Here you'll use<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/all-but-first.png" alt="all but first of ( )"> to deal with the <em>rest</em> of the list.</p>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
Imagine that there were no <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/length_block.png" alt="length of ( )">
block in Snap<em>!</em>. You want to count the items in a list.
<ol>
  <li>Start defining a 
    <img align="bottom" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/count-head.png" alt="count of (list)">
block. (Don't call it <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/length_block.png" alt="length of ( )">
so there's no confusion with the built in version.)</li>
<li>The basic idea here is that a list consists of its first item and all the rest of the items.  But that doesn't apply to an empty list, so you have to treat that as a special case:<br />
                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools-mini.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" />
<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/count-empty-test.png" alt="count of (list): if &lt;empty? (list)&gt; report ( ) else ( )"><br />
How many items does an empty list have?  Fill in the <code>report</code> block's input.</li>
<div class="vocab"><br /><strong>Recursion</strong> is the use of a block within its own definition.</div>
<li>Click the "Apply" button at the bottom of the Block Editor.  This is important because you're going to use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/count-of.png" alt="count of ( )"> block in the next step.</li>
<li>Now for non-empty lists.
<ol type="a">
<li>Suppose <code>all but first of</code> the input list has 47 items.  How many items does the entire list have?</li>
<li>Suppose <code>all but first of</code> the input list has 126 items.  How many items does the entire list have?</li>
<li>Fill in the <code>else</code> part of the <code>if</code> so that it reports the correct number of items in a non-empty list. As you know, you're pretending that there is no <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/length_block.png" alt="length of ( )"> block available.</li>
<li>Test your block for various input lists.  Try an empty list and a list of one item, as well as larger lists.</li>
</ol></li></ol></div>
<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/item-1-of.png" alt="item (1) of ( )"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/all-but-first.png" alt="all but first of ( )"> are the <em>selectors</em> for the List data type.  The corresponding <em>constructor</em> is&nbsp;<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/in-front-of.png" alt="( ) in front of ( )">.
<div class="forYouToDo">
Here's the goal: <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/squares-demo.png" alt="squares (list 7 8 1) reporting {49, 64, 1}">
<ol start="5">
<li>Build this:<br />
<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/squares-framework.png" alt="squares (numbers): if &lt;empty? (numbers)&gt; report ( ) else report ( )">
<br />Click "Apply."
</li>
               <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
<li>What <em>type</em> of thing does <code>squares</code> report? (A number? A list? A Boolean?)</li>
<li>What should it report if its input is an empty list?  Fill in that <code>report</code> block.</li>
<li>For a nonempty list, what value should it compute for <code>item 1 of</code> its input?  Put an expression to compute that value in the first input slot of the <code>in front of</code> block.</li>
<li>What value should it report for <code>all but first of</code> the input?  Put the recursive call in the remaining input slot.</li>
<li>Test your block.</li>
<li>Build this: <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/initials-demo.png" alt="initials (list yakko wakko dot) reports {y, w, d}">
</ol>
</div>
<div class="takeItFurther">
<ol type="A"><li>In the next lab, you'll learn a more concise way to solve these problems using <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/map.png" alt="map (function) over (list)">.  It takes a function as its first input, like <code>keep</code>.  Experiment with it.</li>
<li>Can you think of a problem that you <em>can</em> solve using recursion, but <em>can't</em> solve using <code>map</code> or <code>keep</code> without recursion?</li></ol></div>
