<h2>Sorting Contacts by Name</h2>
    <div class="learn">There's hardly anything you have to do <strong>on this page</strong>, but that's the point &mdash; to see how easy data abstraction makes this problem.</div>
    <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
    <ol><li>Read through all the blocks you wrote on the previous page, and write down a list of all the ones that assume that the list you're sorting has numbers as items.</li>
    <li>Compare your ideas with another group.</li>
    <li>Edit your <code>smallest item in</code> block so that instead of comparing numeric values, it compares two Contacts (the abstract data type from Lab 1), using the <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-sorting.png" alt="name (sorting form)"> block.
      <div class="narrower">
    The <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/lessthan.png" alt="less than"> block will compare words, using alphabetical order, not just numbers.  Therefore, so will your <code>min</code> block.</div>
    <a id="hintbutton" onClick="document.getElementById('hintbutton').innerHTML='The list input slot in the <code>name</code> block counts as one empty slot for <code>combine</code>.';">(Don't click unless you really, really need a super big hint.)</a>
    </li>
    <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />
    <li>Now try 
      <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sort-contact-list.png" alt="sort (contact list)">. Debug it if necessary.  Make sure the contacts are sorted by <em>family</em> name.</li>
      </ol></div>
      <div class="ifTime">
      <ol start="5">
    <li>Add a &quot;sort by name&quot; button to your contact list app.</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="takeItFurther">
    <ol type="A">
<li>It's a shame that, now that your <code>sort</code> block sorts contacts, it doesn't work for numbers any more.  Make a
<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sort-using.png" alt="sort (list) using comparison function (predicate)"> block.  You should be able to sort numbers with
<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sort-using-less.png" alt="sort ( ) using comparison function (&lt;)">.
<ol type="a">
<li>The block's second input <em>must</em> have a type of Predicate (not Boolean).  That puts the grey ring around the input slot, so that the input is the function itself, not the result of calling the function. (You'll find Predicate in the same type-choosing window in which you can declare an input to be Number or List type.)</li>
<li>Pass the input predicate down to <code>smallest</code>, also as an input of type Predicate.</li>
<li>Within <code>smallest</code>, use that predicate input as the function input to <code>combine</code>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Make sure you can sort both lists of numbers and lists of contacts by using appropriate predicates as the second input to <code>sort</code>.
<li>Use your block to sort a list of numbers from largest to smallest.
    </ol>
