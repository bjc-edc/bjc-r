<h2>Selection Sort</h2>
    <div class="learn">
    <strong>On this page</strong> you'll learn one of many possible <em>algorithms</em> for sorting the items of a list.</div>
<div class="ifTime">
    <ol><li>As a class or in small groups, see if you can invent an algorithm (just in words, not Snap<em>!</em> code) to sort a list.</li></ol></div>
    There are many different sorting algorithms.  In Unit 5, you'll go into algorithms in more depth, and learn several of them.  But for now, you'll use one of the simplest, called <em>selection sort</em>.
    <div class="forYouToDo" id="first"><br />
    <strong>We want to sort the contact list by name, but we're going to start with a simpler problem: sorting a list of numbers.</strong>
<ol start="2">
<li>Open your project "U3L1-ContactList"; save it as "U3L2-ContactList".</li>
  <li>Write the <code>min</code> block that takes two inputs and reports whichever is smaller.  (You've done this before, but it's probably quicker to do it again than to find it in some earlier project and import it.)
    <li>Try these examples:<br />
  <div class="sideHOM">Unlike <code>keep</code>, <code>combine</code> requires a function with <em>two</em> empty input slots.</div>    
 <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine-plus.png" alt="combine with (+) items of (list 7 8 1)"><br />       
 <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine-times.png" alt="combine with (*) items of (list 7 8 1)"><br />       
 <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine-min.png" alt="combine with (min) items of (list 7 8 1)">
</li>
    <li>Write a block <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/smallest-item.png" alt="smallest item of ( )"> that reports the smallest item in a list. You may assume that there is at least one item in the list.</li>
    <li>The selection sort algorithm says to find the smallest item in a list, <em>pull that item out of the list,</em> recursively sort the remaining items, and stick the smallest item in front of the result. Write a block <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/remove.png" alt="remove ( ) from ( )"></li> that reports a list that's a copy of its second input, but with its first input removed.
    <div class="narrower">
    You can do this using <code>keep</code> if you assume that there are no equal items in the list.  That's fine for now, although a correct sorting algorithm will keep all duplicate items in the result.</div>
    <div class="takeNote">You might be tempted to use the command <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/replace.png" alt="replace item ( ) of ( ) with ( )"> in this problem, but your <code>sort</code> block should <em>report a new sorted version</em> of the list, without changing the original list.  Sometimes it's okay to modify the original list, but sometimes it isn't, so go for the most generally useful solution.</div></li>
    <li>Now, fill in the blanks in this recursive sort function:<br />
    <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sort-framework.png" alt="sort (data): if ( ) report ( ) else report (( ) in front of ( ))"></li>
</ol></div>
<div class="ifTime"><ol start="7">
<li>If your <code>sort</code> block calls <code>smallest</code> twice, use a script variable to improve its speed by calling <code>smallest</code> only once.</li>
</ol></div>
  <div class="takeItFurther">
<ol type="A">
<li>Finish this recursive definition to solve the problem about equal items mentioned in problem 5:<br />
<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/remove-framework.png" width="358" height="321" alt="remove (value) from (data): if &lt;empty? data&gt; report ( ) else if &lt;value = (item 1 of data)&gt; report ( ) else report ( )"></li>
<li>If you're interested, research other sorting algorithms. Why don't they just pick the best one and forget about the others?</li>
</ol>
