        <h3>Caesar Ciphers and Substitution Ciphers</h3>
        
        On the previous page (or at some point in your life), you might have used a <strong>substitution cipher</strong> to encode your message. Perhaps you just shifted each letter of the alphabet by a certain number (like 4):
        <div class="indent">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</div>
        <div class="indent">WXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUV</div> 
        That's a Caesar cipher (named for Julius Caesar).<br>
        <br>
        Or you may have substituted letters without keeping them in alphabetical order, like this:
        <div class="indent">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</div>
        <div class="indent">PQVFUBZOTHWYELIXRNAMGDSCKJ</div>
        That's a general substitution cipher.

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>The person who receives your message has to know how to decode it. If you are a king and you send a messenger to deliver your secret message, why might you prefer a Caesar cipher to a substitution cipher? Or why might you prefer the substitution cipher? What are some ways you could make the substitution cipher a more secure alternative to use?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeItFurther">
        	<ol type="A">
            	<li>It turns out that even a general substitution cipher is relatively easy to figure out because certain letters in our language are used more frequently than others. You might have used this idea to break your partner's code on the previous page.
                <ul>
                	<li>You can see an example and read about Al-Kindi, the Arabic philosopher and mathematician who first described frequency analysis, in "Breaking Substitution Ciphers" (<a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=185" target="_blank"><em>Blown to Bits</em> pages 166-169</a>).</li>
                    <li>It turns out this method is still useful today, even with better  cryptography tools: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/09/03/microsoft-dumb-attacks-cracks-next-gen-cryptography/" target="_blank">How a 1200-year-old Hacking Technique Can Already Crack Tomorrow's Encrypted Vaults (Forbes, 9/3/15)</a></li>

        <h3>Better methods of encryption</h3>
        
        There are many other methods of cryptography. Many of them follow the pattern shown in this image (taken from <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=189" target="_blank"><em>Blown to Bits</em> page 171</a>).
