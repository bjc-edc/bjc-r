            <ol>
                <li>On a sheet of paper, make up a message to send to a partner. Invent some way of encoding the message, then send the encoded message to your partner.</li>
                <li>When you get your partner's encoded message, try to decode it. What strategies are you using to decode the message?</li>
                <li>Get together with another pair of students and compare the methods you used to encode your messages. Was anyone able to decode their message? How did they do it?</li>
