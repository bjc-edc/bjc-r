                <li>Is there some similar interesting thing to do with combine?  We can combine words instead of numbers, or make pairs (lists) of shapes and colors (pretty lame, but at least recognizable result).  Not so many things come to mind.  Brian?   We’re not looking for an excuse to practice using combine but a reason for wishing we’d known about it all our life!  We should not come out of this saying “is that all you can do with it?” which is what I’m feeling about some of the material we now have.</li>
        		<li>There are only a few functions you ever use with combine, and mostly
they're arithmetic.  The others are the Boolean operators and JOIN and
JOIN WORDS.  So, I don't know, you could write camelCase that takes a
sentence, capitalizes all but the first word (with map), and then
combines them with join.  You could write list-&gt;sentence and list-&gt;word,
even though they're in the tools library. Combine just isn't as versatile as the others! --BH</li>

                <li>BH: I'm not sure I like the first exercise.  The fact that you can use the same value in more than one input slot with map is an obscure secondary feature; I'd rather kids see that map expects a single input slot, whereas combine requires (exactly) two input slots.  I'm too tired right now to try to craft an alternative, though.  :-(</li>

            	<div class="todo">Mary, the semicolons in the combine page should be commas.  Feel free to change, but only if we’re even keeping the examples.  I see “non-associative blocks” and “factorial” and know that this would be great in a mathematics course because it’s so concrete—we can actually build the things we’re talking about—but this is not a mathematics course.  All the calculations should come in—we want this course to help kids with their mathematics, so the ideas of applying functions to numbers, building calculations that do what we want, etc., should all be there—but that notion of building calculations that we want means that we need to want them for something. They can’t just be arbitrary, just as we wouldn’t want them to be arbitrary in our mathematics curricula.

            <!--- <div class="comment">JK: BH says "The join words example in the orange box is really confusing.  It has to be join words (join words (the) (cat)) (sat) = join words (the) (join words (cat) (sat))" But I think that's more confusing. You're allowed to put phrases in join words... I'd like to keep it as is... Any other opinions out there?</div>--->
            
            <p>These operations are <em>associative</em>, which means that the result is the same no matter how the items are grouped. For example, (3 + 4) + 5 = 3 + (4 + 5) and <code>join words</code>("the cat")("sat") = <code>join words</code>("the")("cat sat").</p>

<!--<p><br />Let's say you have a list of numbers, such as all the students' grades on a quiz. You want to find the average grade. There are two steps: First, add up all the numbers; then divide that sum by the number of numbers &#45 that is, by the length of the list.<br />
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/average.png" alt="average uses COMBINE WITH +" title="average uses COMBINE WITH +"/>
<br />
Notice that the red <code>length</code> <code>of</code> block that finds the number of items in a list is different from the green <code>length of</code> block that finds the number of letters in a text string.

<br /><br />
The first input to the <code>combine with</code> block is a <i>two-input </i>function. In this case, it's the <b><code>+</code></b> block, because we want to add all the numbers. In fact, unlike the situation with the <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> blocks, there are really only a handful of functions you'll ever use with <b>combine</b>:<br />
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/bad-operators.png" alt="+, *, and, or, join, join words" title="+, *, and, or, join, join words"/>
</p>
Why did we include the addition and multiplication operators, but not subtraction or division? Using an operator with <code>combine</code> makes sense only if it doesn't matter whether the values are combined left to right or right to left. That is,
<br />
3+(4+5) = (3+4)+5
<br />but
<br />3-(4-5) &ne; (3-4)-5

<p><br />
  Very occasionally you'll define a two-input custom reporter for use with <code>combine</code>.

The two-input <code>max</code> block is an example; try using that to find the largest of a list of numbers.<b><br />
</b><br />
We should try out the <code>average</code> block:<br />
<img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/hof/avg781.png" alt="average of the list 7,8,1 iw 5.333333" title="average of the list 7,8,1 iw 5.333333"/>
<br />Is that the answer you'd expect?<br /><br />
