        <h3>Analyzing Data</h3>
        <p>
            <div class="comment">DAT-2.D.4</div>
            You can ask questions about a specific subset of your data by <em>filtering</em> the data using <code>keep</code>. Filtering is a powerful technique for finding information and recognizing patterns in data. For example, filtering can help you answer questions like "What is the average city MPG <em>for just the Subarus</em> in this dataset?"<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/average-mpg-of-subarus-reporting.png" alt="average of (column (9) of table (keep items (field (14) of record 'empty list input slot' = Subaru) from (data of table (cars))) reporting 19.704..." title="average of (column (9) of table (keep items (field (14) of record 'empty list input slot' = Subaru) from (data of table (cars))) reporting 19.704..." /><br />
            Column 14 is the "Make" of the vehicle, so we <code>keep</code> all the records from <var>cars</var> for which the 14<sup>th</sup> field is "Subaru." Then, we take column 9 of those records (the "City MPG") and find their average.
        </p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p>Notice that there are many digits in the answer above.  How many digits are given in the table for each car's MPG?  An important rule in data science is not to claim more precision in a result than is warranted by the given data, so this answer should be rounded to 19.</p>

            Sometimes, you want to keep a subset of your data (such as "Which cars were made in 2010?"), but other times, you just want one item that matches your requirement, often because what you really want to know is whether <em>any</em> items match, and as soon as you find one, the answer is &quot;yes&quot; (such as "Were any electric cars made in 2010?"). Snap<em>!</em> has a higher order function <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/find-first.png" alt="find first item () in 'list input slot'" title="find first item () in 'list input slot'" /> that works similarly to <code>keep</code>, but it reports only the first item that's found, so it can be faster.

        <div class="endnote">
            <p><code>Find first</code> is a higher order function like <code>keep</code>, <code>map</code>, and <code>combine</code>, because it takes a function (a predicate) as input. (<code>Find first</code> is like <code>item (1) of (keep)</code>.)</p>
