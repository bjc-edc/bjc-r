        <p>
        	But what if I want more than just one sprite?
        </p>
        <p>
        	It is definitely possible for you to have more than one sprite on the stage at the same time. All you need to do is click on the arrow button on the top left corner of the sprite corral region of the <span class="snap">snap</span> window.
