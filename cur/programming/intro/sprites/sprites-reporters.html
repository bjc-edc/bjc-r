        	<strong>Sensor Blocks</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        	At the bottom of Motion palette are three blocks
   shaped differently from the others. The oval-shaped <img
   src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_xposition.png" alt="X Position
   Reporter"/> and <img
   src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_yposition.png" alt="Y Position
   Reporter"/> are called <em>reporters</em>.  (We don't need the
   third one right now.)  Unlike the jigsaw-puzzle-piece-shaped
   <em>command</em> blocks we've used until now, reporters don't carry
   out an action (such as moving the sprite or displaying a speech
   balloon) by themselves.  Instead they <em>report</em> a value,
   usually for use in another block's input slot.
        </p>
        <p>
        	These particular reporters tell you where the sprite
   is on the stage.  As in algebra class, <b>x</b> means left-to-right
   position, and <b>y</b> means bottom-to-top position.
        </p>
        <p>
If your sprite is in the middle of the stage, drag it somewhere
   off-center.  Then, drag an <b>x position</b> block into the
   scripting area and click on it.  You should see a little speech
   balloon next to the block:
</p><img src="../../../../img/topic1/xpos-bubble.png" alt="X Position
   speech balloon"/><p>
Click on the gray box to the left of the <b>x position</b> block in
   the palette, and then look over to the stage. You will see that the
   value that the block would report is displayed on the stage:
        </p><img src="../../../../img/topic1/palette-checkbox.png"
   alt="X Position block's checkbox"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="../../../../img/topic1/watcher.png" alt="X Position stage
   watcher"/>
<p>This on-stage display is called a <em>watcher</em>.</p>
        <p>
        	The <img
   src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_xposition.png" alt="X Position
   Sensor Block"/> and the <img
   src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_yposition.png" alt="Y Position
   Sensor Block"/> will tell you the position of your sprite on the
   screen. Move the sprite around and the values reported by these blocks change.
