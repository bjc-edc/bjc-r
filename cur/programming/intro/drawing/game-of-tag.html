			We are going to make a small game of tag in <span class="snap">snap</span> .  Make a second set of four scripts, controlled by a different set of keys, for your other sprite.
		</p>
		<p>
			We want one of the characters to react if the two characters touch.  We can add the following  script to the <code>Duck</code> sprite to say <code>OH NOs!!!</code> when it touches Alonzo.

		<em>Note</em>: One really important thing to note here is that once we click the green flag, the script above will <strong>always</strong> be running: notice that it always has a highlighted outline.  Compare this to the script below that would only run once when you click the green flag.  The functionality above is often called an <strong>infinite loop</strong>, and can be very helpful when we want something to continue running forever.
