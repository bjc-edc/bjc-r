        	Assemble a collection of blocks from the
   <b>Motion</b>  and  <b>Pen</b> tabs into a script that draws a square or triangle or some other a simple picture. You will almost certainly want at least these blocks        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move-10-steps.png" alt="Move 10 Steps Block"/>, <img  class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-right-15.png" alt="Turn Right 15 Degrees Block"/>, <img  class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/clear.png" alt="Clear Block"/>, 
        	and <img  class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pen-down.png" alt="Pen Up Block"/>.</p>
        <p>
        	Notes:
<ol>
        		<li>
        			Once the pen is down, it stays down
   even in a different script. If you want your script to move the sprite  without leaving a trace,  use the <img  class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pen-up.png" alt="Pen Down Block"/> block to &quot;lift the pen.&quot; </li>
     
        		<li>
        			Remember that you can, if you  want, use <em>watchers</em> to show the direction of the sprite or its <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates (see  <a href="/bjc=r/cur/programming/intro/sprites/sprites-sensor-blocks.html">Reporters</a>).
