        	Try to get comfortable with the blocks under the
   <b>Motion</b> tab and the <b>Pen</b> tab. Figure out what each one does, and
   try to use these blocks to draw a square or a simple picture. Get started by testing these blocks:
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move-10-steps.png" alt="Move 10 Steps Block"/>
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img  class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-right-15.png" alt="Turn Right 15 Degrees Block"/>
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img  class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/clear.png" alt="Clear Block"/>
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img  class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pen-up.png" alt="Pen Down Block"/>
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img  class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pen-down.png" alt="Pen Up Block"/>
        </p>
        <p>
        	Tips and Tricks:
        	<ol>
        		<li>
        			Once the pen is down, it stays down
   even in a different script. Use the <code>pen up</code> block to lift the pen
   so that no lines will be drawn.
        		</li>
     
        		<li>
        			You also will want to show the direction and x and y 
        			position of the sprite. In the Motion tab, you can select 
        			for these to be shown on the stage as described in the 
        			<a href="/bjc=r/cur/programming/intro/sprites/sprites-sensor-blocks.html">Reporters</a> 
        			activity you saw earlier in the lab.
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			Try this: Does the <b>turn</b> block change the x or the y position?
        		</li>
        	</ol>
