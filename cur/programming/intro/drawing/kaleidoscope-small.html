            Explore <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/drawing/kaleidoscope.xml">this 
            drawing program</a> for a little bit. Press
            the spacebar to run the program, and move your mouse cursor over
            the stage of the <span class="snap">snap</span>  window. 
            While over the stage, use the <code>d</code> (pen down), 
            <code>u</code> (pen up), and <code>c</code> (clear) keyboard keys 
            to change what gets drawn on the screen. The script that 
            causes the sprite to follow the pointer is
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/follow-that-mouse-when-space.png" alt="Kaleidoscope Script"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, this drawing program features more
            <b>Control</b> blocks, in addition to the <code>forever</code> block
            first introduced in the <i>Follow the Mouse</i> activity. These <em>hat</em> shaped blocks, which can be used only at the beginning
            of a script, indicate when a specific script should be run.

                For this activity, your job is to make a (kind of) kaleidoscope, like:

            Some tips:
        </p>

        <p class="step">
            You will need four sprites.  (We
            haven't used more than one sprite up to now, but having more than
            one allows for more interesting projects, as you'll see.) The
            easiest way to create three more is to <em>duplicate</em> the one
            you have. Right-click the sprite in the sprite corral, and select
            <b>duplicate</b> from the <em>context menu</em> that appears. Each
            duplicated sprite will have exactly the same scripts as the
            original, which is why we suggest duplication rather than just
            creating more sprites from scratch.
        </p>
        <p class="step">
            You can change the color of each sprite by clicking the color input 
            in that sprite's <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-pen-color.png" alt="Set Pen to Color X Block"/> 
            block (found under the <b>Pen</b> tab), choosing a color, and then 
            clicking on the the block itself (to run the block and actually set the color). 
            Don't worry about matching the colors in the animation exactly!
        </p>
        <p class="step">
            Pay close attention to what each of
            the other sprites is doing in the animation above. You will need to
            modify the <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> inputs in each sprite's <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-0-0.png" alt="Go to X Y Block"/> 
            block using simple formulas,
            with <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/plus.png"> and 
            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/minus.png">.
        </p>
        <p class="step">
          Hint: All the sprites are reflecting in different ways around the (x=0, y=0) origin point of the stage.
          (Notice that one sprite is following the mouse.)
        </p> 
        <p>
            Once you figured this out, try out some complicated formulas and/or more sprites, and share with your classmates!
