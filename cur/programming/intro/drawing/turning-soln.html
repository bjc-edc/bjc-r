<p>1. Through how many degrees did your sprite turn <em>altogether </em>(not per side) when you drew a triangle?</p>
<p>Answer: <label style="color: green">360</label>
</p>
<p><b>Each turn was 120 degrees, and there were three turns, for a total of 3*120=360 degrees.</b></p>
<p>2. Through how many degrees did your sprite turn <em>altogether </em>when you drew a pentagon?</p>
<p>Answer: <label style="color: green">360</label>
</p>
<p>3. Through how many degrees did your sprite turn <em>altogether </em> when you drew a five-pointed star?</p>
<p>Answer: <label style="color: green">720</label>
</p>
<p><b>Polygons that don't intersect themselves require a total turning of 360 degrees &mdash; one full circle.  Stars turn all the way around more than once.  Try using something like a pencil (flat on the table) to simulate a sprite tracing the path of a star.</b></p>
<p>4. What is the <em>smallest </em>number you can put into the numeric input of the <code>repeat</code> block below to produce the picture shown?</p>
