<p>"Remixing" is the Scratch communities term for downloading another user's project, enhancing it in some way, and then re-posting it. Scratch community members see re-mixing as a complement and earn notoriety for the number of re-mixes their projects inspire.</p>
<p>In this activity, download someone else's project and make a change. You may decide to re-post the project or not.</p>
<p>If you are interested in exploring sound and music more, download Alex Ruthmann's, of the University of Massachusetts Lowell, amazing projects <a target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu/users/alexruthmann">here</a>. His techniques are advanced but you'll be able to play with what he has done and see what can Scratch offers. <br></p>    </body></html>
