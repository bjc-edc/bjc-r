 We need you to take some time to get to know the scratch community and set yourself up to program at home.<br><br> 1. At home, you can download Scratch from http://scratch.mit.edu.<br><br> 2. A scratch account allows you to download other users projects as well as post your own. It is an exciting forum for sharing your work and seeing what others are working on. You can create a Scratch account at http://scratch.mit.edu.<br><br> 3. The "galleries" item in the main menu bar allows you to explore others projects. In the next activity, we download one and "re-mix" it.<br></body></html>
