        	You may have noticed that when running the sound scripts, 
        	you would hear each sound one after another.  For example,
        	<a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/sounds/seq=prog-sounds.xml">
        	open this project</a>. 
        	Before you run the script, predict what will happen 
        	when the script is run. Now run the script.  Is what you predicted what actually happened?
    	<p>
    		This exercise is to show you that scripts run in a specific order,
    		from the top of the script to the bottom of the script. 
    		Your script will finish running one block before continuing 
    		on to the next one below it. Knowing this, you can plan out 
    		your scripts so that you can make something happen before the 
    		another thing happens. Keep this in mind when you make scripts 
    		in the future! It will help you understand what is going on in 
    		case something you have made is not working correctly.
