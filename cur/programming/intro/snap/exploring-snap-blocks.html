        <p>
            The area at the left edge of the window is the
            <em>palette</em>.  As you see in the picture, it contains tabs for eight
            different-color block categories. In this lab, we will focus on the
            <b>Motion</b>, <b>Sound</b>, <b>Pen</b>, and <b>Sensing</b> tabs.
            You will learn about the other tabs in the next few labs.
        </p>
        <p>
            These tabs are an important organizational structure
            in <span class="snap">snap</span> because they are home to the
            various blocks that you will use to tell the computer what to
            do. The blocks are categorized under each tab based on what kind of
            thing each block does.
        </p>
        <div class="clearBoth"></div>
        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
            Look at the <b>Motion</b> tab. Under this tab you will find a bunch of
             blocks that correspond to motion-like actions. For example, click on the 
             <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move-10-steps.png" alt="Move 10 Steps Block"/> 
             block, drag it to the scripting area, and drop it anywhere in the scripting area.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
            <img alt="animation of move block dragging from palette to scripting area" src="/bjc-r/img/intro/drag-a-block.gif" />
        </div>
        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
            The block that you just dragged and dropped into the
            scripting area controls something that we call a <em>sprite</em>,
            which is the arrowhead-looking thing in the middle of the stage
            (the white part of the window).
        </p>
        <p>
            Back to the scripting area, if you click on the 
            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move-10-steps.png" alt="Move 10 Steps Block"/> 
            you just put there, the sprite will move 10 steps. 
            You can see this visually depicted by the sprite moving in the stage. 
            You can vary the input of the block, i.e., the number 10, to change 
            the number of steps you want to the sprite to move. See if you can 
            figure out how to change the block input so that the sprite moves backwards!
