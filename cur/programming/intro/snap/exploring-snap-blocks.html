        	We name the
   sections of the <em><span class="snap">snap</span> </em> window so that we can talk about them.

        <p>
            The area called the
<em>palette</em> contains the blocks (individual instructions) that you will use to tell the computer what you want it to do. The blocks are organized into eight categories according to the kind of thing each block does. </p>
        
       <ul class="alert quoteOrange"> 
       <li><strong>Brief exploration of the Motion blocks:  </strong>Right now, the blue &quot;Motion&quot; tab is lit up at the top of the page and you are looking at the blocks in that category.  </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Click on <img src="/bjc-r/img/intro/move.png" height="30" alt="move.png"> three or four times and watch  the <em>stage</em> to see what the arrowhead-shaped <em>sprite</em> does. </li>
          <li>Click on <img src="/bjc-r/img/intro/turn cw.png" height="30"  alt="turn cw"> a few times to see what happens. </li>
          <li>What does <img src="/bjc-r/img/intro/go to x y.png" height="30" alt="go to x y"> do?  </li>
          <li>What do the other blocks seem to do? </li>
          <li>Change a number in one of the blocks and see how that changes what the block does. </li>
        </ul>
<li><strong>Leaving a trace: </strong>The sprite moved without leaving a trace. If you want the sprite to draw&mdash;to leave a trace as it moves&mdash;it must &quot;touch the tip of its pen&quot; to the &quot;paper&quot; of the <em>stage</em>. The command <img src="/bjc-r/img/intro/pen down.png" height="30" alt="pen down"> tells it to set its penpoint down on that paper. <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/intro/snap/RobotTurtleHistNote.html" title="Robot Turtle Historical Note">Historical Note: Robot "Turtles" with real pens before sprites</a></li>
        <li><strong>Scavenger hunt&mdash;a brief exploration of other tabs: </strong>Click the other tabs to see if you can find these thirteen blocks. As you find them, click <em>them</em> to see if you can figure out what they do. Some have effects on the stage. Some do other things.</p>

<p>In this lab, we will focus on the <b>Motion</b>, <b>Sound</b>, <b>Pen</b>, and <b>Sensing</b> tabs.
          You will learn more about the other tabs in the next few labs.
</p>
<p class="alert quoteOrange">
    Look back at the <b>Motion</b> tab. As you've seen, its blocks  correspond to motion-like actions. Drag the 
    <img src="/bjc-r/img/intro/move (no input).png" width="108" alt="move "> block to some spot in the scripting area and drop it there. </p>
        <div class="center">
            <img alt="animation of move block dragging from palette to scripting area" src="/bjc-r/img/intro/drag-a-block.gif" />
        </div>
        
        <p class="alert quoteOrange">You already know that if you click on that block, the sprite will move that number of steps. 
            You also know that you can vary the input of the block to change 
        the number of steps you want to the sprite to move. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>See if you can 
            figure out how to change the block input so that the sprite moves backwards! </li>
