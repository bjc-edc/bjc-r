        <p>
            The area called the
<em>palette</em> contains the blocks (individual instructions) that you will use to tell the computer what you want it to do. The blocks are organized into eight categories according to the kind of thing each block does. </p>
        <p><strong>Brief exploration of the motion blocks:  </strong>Right now, the blue &quot;Motion&quot; tab is lit up at the top of the page and you are looking at the blocks in that category.  Click on <img src="/bjc-r/img/intro/move.png" width="108.8" height="24" alt="move.png"> three or four times and watch  the <em>stage</em> to see what the <em>sprite</em> does. Click on <img src="/bjc-r/img/intro/turn cw.png" width="131.2" height="25.5" alt="turn cw"> a few times to see what happens. What does <img src="/bjc-r/img/intro/go to x y.png" width="123.8" height="24" alt="go to x y"> do?  What do the other blocks seem to do? Change a number in one of the blocks and see how that changes what the block does. </p>
        <p><strong>Leaving a trace: </strong>The sprite moved but didn't leave a trace. To get it to draw as it moves, look for the <img src="/bjc-r/img/intro/pen down.png" width="68.5" height="20.4" alt="pen down"></p>
        <p><strong>What else is there?  A brief scavenger hunt: </strong>To see what's in another  category, click its tab. </p>

<p>In this lab, we will focus on the <b>Motion</b>, <b>Sound</b>, <b>Pen</b>, and <b>Sensing</b> tabs.
          You will learn about the other tabs in the next few labs.
</p>
        <p>
            These tabs are an important organizational structure
            in <span class="snap">snap</span> because they are home to the
            various blocks that you will use to tell the computer what to
            do. The blocks are categorized under each tab based on what kind of
            thing each block does.
</p>
        <div class="clearBoth"></div>
        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
            Look at the <b>Motion</b> tab. Under this tab you will find a bunch of
             blocks that correspond to motion-like actions. For example, click on the 
             <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move-10-steps.png" alt="Move 10 Steps Block"/> 
             block, drag it to the scripting area, and drop it anywhere in the scripting area.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
            <img alt="animation of move block dragging from palette to scripting area" src="/bjc-r/img/intro/drag-a-block.gif" />
        </div>
        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
            The block that you just dragged and dropped into the
            scripting area controls something that we call a <em>sprite</em>,
            which is the arrowhead-looking thing in the middle of the stage
            (the white part of the window).
        </p>
        <p>
            Back to the scripting area, if you click on the 
            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move-10-steps.png" alt="Move 10 Steps Block"/> 
            you just put there, the sprite will move 10 steps. 
            You can see this visually depicted by the sprite moving in the stage. 
            You can vary the input of the block, i.e., the number 10, to change 
            the number of steps you want to the sprite to move. See if you can 
            figure out how to change the block input so that the sprite moves backwards!
