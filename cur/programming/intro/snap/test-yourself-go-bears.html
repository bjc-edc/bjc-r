                    Without trying this in <span class="snap">snap</span> , try to answer the following question:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    What does the following set of scripts do when you click on the <code>When I receive Turn1</code> script?
                </p>
                <p><img src="../../../../img/prog/turn1.png" alt="turn1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="../../../../img/prog/turn2.png" alt="turn2" />
                  </p>
                <p>
                    Choose one:
                </p>

                <div class="text">
                    The sprite says &quot;Go!&quot; and then &quot;Bears!&quot; once.

                    No, the <code>broadcast Turn1 and wait</code> block after the <code>say Bears! ...</code> block will execute.  <span class="snap">snap</span>  will blindly follow its script.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="choice" identifier="c2">
                <div class="text">
                    The sprite says &quot;Go!&quot; and then &quot;Bears!&quot; until you hit the red Stop button.
                </div>
                <div class="feedback">
                    <p>
                        Right!
                        Here, we see an <em>infinite loop,</em> or a never-ending loop. Whenever this happens in Snap<em>!</em>, we can always stop it by pressing the Stop button at the top right of the window, just above the stage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why does this happen? Well, when you click on the <code> When I receive Turn1</code>
                        script, the sprite says <code> Go</code>
                        for two seconds, and then broadcasts a <code> Turn2</code> message.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If there is any character that has a script that responds to the <code> Turn2</code>
                        message, it will perform that script. In this case, the same sprite has a script that responds to the <code> Turn2</code>
                        message, and so it will run the corresponding script. It says <code> Bears!</code>
                        and then broadcasts a <code>Turn1</code>
                        message. But, it also has a script that responds to the <code> Turn1</code>
                        message, which in turn sends a <code> Turn2</code>
                        message, and so on. This continues until the scripts are forced to stop.

                <div class="feedback">
                    No, the script here definitely does something when clicking on <code>When I receive Turn1</code>

                <div class="feedback">
                    No.  The computer can't just decide to stop itself; rather, it will blindly follow the script!
