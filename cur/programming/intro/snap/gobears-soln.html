<p>Without trying this in <span class="snap">snap</span> , try to answer the following question: <br />
  <br />
What does the following set of scripts do when you click on the <code>When I receive Turn1</code> script? </p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/turn1.png" alt="turn1" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/turn2.png" alt="turn2" /><br />
</p>
<form id="form1" name="form1" method="post" action="">
  <p>
    <label style="color: red">
      <input type="radio" name="RadioGroup1" value="a" id="RadioGroup1_0" />
      a. The sprite says &quot;Go!&quot; and then &quot;Bears!&quot; once.</label>
    <br />
    <label style="color: green">
      <input type="radio" name="RadioGroup1" value="b" checked="checked" id="RadioGroup1_1" />
      b. The sprite says &quot;Go!&quot; and then &quot;Bears!&quot; until you hit the red Stop button. </label>
    <br />
    <label style="color: red">
      <input type="radio" name="RadioGroup1" value="c" id="RadioGroup1_2" />
      c. Nothing happens - this does not work.</label>
    <br />
    <label style="color: red">
      <input type="radio" name="RadioGroup1" value="d" id="RadioGroup1_3" />
      d. The sprite says &quot;Go!&quot; and then &quot;Bears!&quot; a few times and then stops by itself.</label>
    <br />
 </p>
</form>
<p>
Here, we see an <em>infinite loop,</em> or a never-ending loop. Whenever this happens in Snap<em>!</em>, we can always stop it by pressing the Stop button at the top right of the window, just above the stage.

<p>Why does this happen? Well, when you click on the <code>When I receive Turn1</code> script, the sprite says <code>Go</code> for two seconds, and then broadcasts a <code>Turn2</code> message.

<p>If there is any character that has a script that responds to the <code>Turn2</code> message, it will perform that script. In this case, the same sprite has a script that responds to the <code>Turn2</code> message, and so it will run the corresponding script. It says <code>Bears!</code> and then broadcasts a <code>Turn1</code> message. But, it also has a script that responds to the <code>Turn1</code> message, which in turn sends a <code>Turn2</code> message, and so on. This continues until the scripts are forced to stop.
