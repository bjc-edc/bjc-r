        For your first project, make a quick song! You will find the following <strong>blocks</strong> in the <code>Sound</code> tab useful; feel free to change the default numbers as you see fit:
        <br>

        <div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" title="Sounds" alt="Sounds" 
        src="/bjc-r/img/sys/sys-sound-blocks.png" 
        origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab01/Sounds.jpg">
        </div>
        <br>
        While you are working on it, try to figure out how to connect and disconnect blocks, and how to remove a piece from inside a long script.
