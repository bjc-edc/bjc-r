            Exploring <span class="snap">snap</span>: Scripts

        <p>
            You can snap  blocks together (hence the name <span class="snap">snap</span>) to build up a set of instructions, a <em>script</em>. Drag one block right underneath another to snap them together. The white bar that appears shows you where the block will go after you drop it.

        <p>
            If you keep attaching blocks together in this way, you will
            create a <em>script</em>. A <span class="snap">snap</span>
            program consists of one or more of these scripts.
        </p>
        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            Try recreating the following script in the scripting
            area in <span class="snap">snap</span>.  The purple <code>say...</code> blocks
            are available from the <b>Looks</b> tab.

        <p>
            What will happen if you run this script? Remember, a
            script will tell the sprite what to do. Click on the script and see
            what happens! You will know that your script is running if it has a
            highlighted border around it:

        </p>
        <p>
            Be sure to note: <b>blocks in a script run in a specific order,
            from the top of the script to the bottom</b>.

            Generally, <span class="snap">snap</span>
            waits until
            one block has finished its job before continuing on to the block below it.
            (One common exception is blocks that play sounds: a block's job can be
            to <i>start</i> the sound, which means the block below it will execute while
            the sound is still playing.
