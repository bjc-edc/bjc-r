            Exploring <span class="snap">snap</span>: Scripts

        <p>
            You can snap  blocks together (hence the name <span class="snap">snap</span>) to build up a set of instructions, a <em>script</em>. Drag one block right underneath another to snap them together. The white bar that appears (see the picture below) shows you where the block will go after you drop it.  </p>
        <p><img class="indent" src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_blocks_snapping.png" alt="Blocks Snapping Together"/></p>
    <p>A <span class="snap">snap</span> program consists of one or more  scripts.    </p>
    <ul>
          <li>Create this two-block script in the scripting area. Click on it a few times to see what it does.<br>
    <br>

          </ul>
    <p>While a script is running its border is highlighted. This one runs so quickly that you may have to look closely to notice the brief border flash.</p>
    <ul>
  <li>
    Here is another script to create.  Predict what it will do and then try it out.<br>
    <br>
            
    <img class="center" src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_justmadeascript.png" alt="You just made a script!"/>
  </li>
  </ul>
    <p>
    This script takes longer to run, so it's easier to notice the highlighted border.<br>

    </p>
<p>
    Blocks in a script run in a specific order,
    from the top of the script to the bottom.

    Generally, <span class="snap">snap</span>
    waits until
    one block has finished its job before continuing on to the block below it.
    (One common exception is blocks that play sounds: a block's job can be
    to <i>start</i> the sound, which means the block below it will execute while
            the sound is still playing.)
