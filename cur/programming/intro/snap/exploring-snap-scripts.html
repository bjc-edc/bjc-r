            Exploring <span class="snap">snap</span>: Scripts
        </title>

        <p>
            You can snap  blocks together (hence the name <span class="snap">snap</span>) to build up a set of instructions, a <em>script</em>. Drag one block right underneath another to snap them together. The white bar that appears (see the picture below) shows you where the block will go after you drop it.  A <span class="snap">snap</span> program consists of one or more  scripts.    </p>
    <ul>
          <li>Create this two-block script in the scripting area. Click on it a few times to see what it does.
            <img class="indent" src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_blocks_snapping.png" alt="Blocks Snapping Together"/></li>
          </ul>
    <ul><li>While a script is running its border is highlighted border. This one runs quickly. See if you can notice the brief border flash.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
  <li>
    Here is another script to create in the scripting
    area in <span class="snap">snap</span>.  Predict what it will do and then try it out.<br>
    <br>
            
    <img class="center" src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_justmadeascript.png" alt="You just made a script!"/>
  </li>
  </ul>
    <ul><li>
    Again notice the highlighted border.<br>
    <br>
    <img class="center" src="../../../../img/topic1/topic1_highlightedscript.png" alt="Script Running"/>
  </li>
    </ul>

        <p>
            Blocks in a script run in a specific order,
            from the top of the script to the bottom.

            Generally, <span class="snap">snap</span>
            waits until
            one block has finished its job before continuing on to the block below it.
            (One common exception is blocks that play sounds: a block's job can be
            to <i>start</i> the sound, which means the block below it will execute while
            the sound is still playing.)
