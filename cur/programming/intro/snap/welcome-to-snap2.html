        <p>
            <span class="snap">snap</span> is a programming language, a language for writing programs. Programs are sets of instructions for the computer
            to follow, telling it what to do.
        </p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p>When the first programming languages were invented, video screens were rare, and people communicated with computers mostly through a keyboard. Because of that history, most programming languages still use a keyboard. <span class="snap">snap</span> is newer: it's a visual language.
            Instead of writing a program  using only the keyboard,
            you will build the program by dragging pictures of blocks (instructions) and clicking them together.

            Programs in most languages use only text, but
            <span class="snap">snap</span> is different: it's a visual language.

            <span class="snap">snap</span> is different that many other languages in
            another way&mdash; you run it in a web browser like Firefox or Chrome.
            At this time, we recommend you use the
            <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome browser</a>.
            The url that you can use to always get to <em><span class="snap">snap</span> </em> is:
        </p>

        <p class="center " style="font-size:150%;line-height: 150%">
        
            <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/run" target="_blank"><b>http://snap.berkeley.edu/run</b></a>

        </p>

        <p>
            In order to save your programs, the first thing you'll need to do is make an
            account.  In the <span class="snap">snap</span> browser window,
            Find the cloud-shaped button in the top toolbar on the upper
            left corner of the window:</p>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-cloud-with-context.png"
            alt="cloud icon"/>.


        <p>
            Click it, select
            the "sign up" option in the menu, and follow the instructions
            there. You will need to check your email after creating your
            account to get your initial password.
