            <span class="snap">snap</span> is a programming language, a language for writing programs. Programs are sets of instructions for the computer
            to follow, telling it what to do.
        </p>
    When the first programming languages were invented, video screens were rare, and people communicated with computers mostly through a keyboard. Because of that history, most programming languages still use a keyboard. <span class="snap">snap</span> is newer: it's a visual language.
            Instead of writing a program  using only the keyboard,
            you will build the program by dragging pictures of blocks (instructions) and clicking them together.
