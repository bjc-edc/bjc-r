            Snap<em>!</em> is a programming language, a language for writing computer programs. Programs are sets of instructions for the computer to follow, telling it what to do.
        </p>
    	<p> When the first programming languages were invented, video screens were rare, and people communicated with computers mostly through a keyboard. Because of that history, most programming languages still use a keyboard. Snap<em>!</em> is newer: it's a visual language. Instead of writing a program  using only the keyboard, you will build the program by dragging pictures of blocks (instructions) and clicking them together.
