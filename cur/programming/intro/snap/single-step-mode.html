		Now that single stepping is turned on, go back and run your "play sound [meow]" scripts from the previous page. Observe how quickly the highlighted block changes on the "play sound [meow]" and likewise how long it waits on the "play sound [meow] until done".

		If you no longer want single stepping on, click <code>Edit</code> and then <code>Stop Single Stepping</code>.
