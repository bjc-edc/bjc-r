            You are interested in finding the number of a person’s ancestors, that is, them, their parents,
            their parents' parents, etc. In their family, everyone has a unique name and couples are always
            recorded together -- if you find one parent, you've found the other. You are provided with three
            helper blocks (which access some global family tree):
        </p>
        
        <ul>
                <li>
                    <img src="../../../../img/hof/parents-found-person.png" alt="parents-found? (person)"/> reports <img src="../../../../img/hof/true.png" alt="true"/>
                    or <img src="../../../../img/hof/false.png" alt="false"/> depending on whether the system has found that person's parents
                    (mother <i>and</i> father) or not.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <img src="../../../../img/hof/mother-person.png" alt="mother (person)"/> reports that person's mother (a <img src="../../../../img/hof/person-variable.png" alt="person"/>),
                    if she was found (if she wasn't found, it's an error).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <img src="../../../../img/hof/father-person.png" alt="father (person)"/> reports that person's father (a <img src="../../../../img/hof/person-variable.png" alt="person"/>),
                    if he was found (if he wasn't found, it's an error).
                </li>
            </ul>
            
        <p>
            Example family: In the diagram, mothers (b, d, f, h) are listed to the left of the fathers (c, e, g, i)
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/family-tree.png" alt="a family tree"/><br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            a's parents were found: b and c (b is the mother, c is the father).<br/>
            b's parents were found: d and e.<br/>
            c's parents were found: f and g.<br/>
            e's parents were found: h and i.<br/>
            d, f, g, h and i's parents were not found in the family tree. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><img src="../../../../img/hof/parents-found-e.png" alt="parents-found? (e)"/> reports <img src="../../../../img/hof/true.png" alt="true"/>
                because we found e's parents, who are h and i.
            </li>
            <li><img src="../../../../img/hof/parents-found-d.png" alt="parents-found? (d)"/> reports <img src="../../../../img/hof/false.png" alt="false"/>,
            	because we didn't find d's parents.</li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../../../img/hof/mother-e.png" alt="mother (e)"/> reports h, because e's mother is h
                (calling <img src="../../../../img/hof/mother-blank.png" alt="mother ()"/> on d, f, g, h or i is an error).
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../../../img/hof/father-e.png" alt="father (e)"/> reports i, because e's father is i
                (calling <img src="../../../../img/hof/father-blank.png" alt="father ()"/> on d, f, g, h or i is an error).
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Fill in the blanks for the block <img src="../../../../img/hof/ancestors-person.png" alt="ancestors (person"/> 
            that <u>reports that person’s <b>total number</b> of
            ancestors (counting themselves).</u> Examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <img src="../../../../img/hof/ancestors-a.png" alt="ancestors (a)"/> reports 9 (for a b c d e f g h i)
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../../../img/hof/ancestors-b.png" alt="ancestors (b)"/> reports 5 (for b d e h i)
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../../../img/hof/ancestors-c.png" alt="ancestors (c)"/> reports 3 (for c f g)
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="../../../../img/hof/ancestors-d.png" alt="ancestors (d)"/> reports 1 (for d), etc...
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Framework for this block is given in the "Ancestors" sprite in the starter file.
            You <u>will not</u> need to use HOFs for this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a bit annoying that this block counts us as one of our ancestors.
            Write the block <img src="../../../../img/hof/ancestors-without-self-person.png" alt="ancestors-without-self (person"/>
            so that it returns the number of ancestors, <u>not
            counting</u> the original person (e.g. <img src="../../../../img/hof/ancestors-without-self-a.png" alt="ancestors-without-self (a)"/>
            will report 8, instead of 9). It should only require subtle changes from the original
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/ancestors-person.png" alt="ancestors (person)"/> block.
