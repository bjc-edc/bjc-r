        	In computer science, one thing we love to do is to take <i>specific</i> problems and <i>generalize</i> them.
            What was specific in <img src="../../../../img/hof/path-home-place.png" alt="path-home (place)"/>? Each <img src="../../../../img/hof/place-variable.png" alt="place"/>
            had exactly <i>two</i> paths out of it (if it wasn't a dead-end), but that's not very realistic. Most places have
            <i>many</i> paths out of them.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	Fortunately, the problem statement won't change much. All we do is replace <img src="../../../../img/hof/go-left-place.png" alt="go-left (place)"/>
            and <img src="../../../../img/hof/go-right-place.png" alt="go-right (place)"/> with <img src="../../../../img/hof/go-neighbors-place.png" alt="go-neighbors (place)"/>,
            which returns a <i>list</i> of neighbor places, each reached by going down a particular path out of that place.
            For example, using the same graph as before (reprinted for your convenience):
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	<img src="../../../../img/hof/forest-paths.png" alt="example forest paths"/>
        </p>
        
        <ul>
        	<b><li><code>go-neighbors(5)</code> ==> <code>(1 2)</code></li>
            <li><code>go-neighbors(6)</code> ==> <code>(3 4)</code></li>
            <li><code>go-neighbors(7)</code> ==> <code>(5 6)</code></li></b>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        	... but you could imagine that some forests might have only one path out of a place, or even a hundred!
            Like before, calling <img src="../../../../img/hof/go-neighbors-place.png" alt="go-neighbors (place)"/> is an error if 
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/place-variable.png" alt="place"/> is a <i>dead-end</i>, so <img src="../../../../img/hof/go-neighbors-place.png" alt="go-neighbors (place)"/>
            will never return a list with no elements.
        </p>
        
        <p> Write the block <img src="../../../../img/hof/generalized-path-home-place.png" alt="generalized-path-home (place)"/> that can handle the generalized
        	forests described above. You will need to use HOFs in your solution, but it will not require drastic changes from your
            original <img src="../../../../img/hof/path-home-place.png" alt="path-home (place)"/> block.
