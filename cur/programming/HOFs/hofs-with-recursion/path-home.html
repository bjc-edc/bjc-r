        <p>
            You’re lost in the forest. Every <img src="../../../../img/hof/place-variable.png" alt="place"/> in the forest
            is either a dead-end or has exactly 2 one-way
            paths: left and right. Your goal is to find out if there is a way home.
            You are presented with four new blocks, two predicates
            and two reporter blocks (all take a <img src="../../../../img/hof/place-variable.png" alt="place"/> as an argument):
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
            	<img src="../../../../img/hof/home-place.png" alt="home (place)"/> reports <img src="../../../../img/hof/true.png" alt="true"/> 
                if the <img src="../../../../img/hof/place-variable.png" alt="place"/> is your home, and <img src="../../../../img/hof/false.png" alt="false"/> otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
            	<img src="../../../../img/hof/dead-end-place.png" alt="dead-end (place)"/> returns <img src="../../../../img/hof/true.png" alt="true"/> if the
                <img src="../../../../img/hof/place-variable.png" alt="place"/> is a dead-end (i.e. no paths from it).
            </li>
            <li>
            	<img src="../../../../img/hof/go-left-place.png" alt="go-left (place)"/> follow the <i>left</i> path, returning
                a new <img src="../../../../img/hof/place-variable.png" alt="place"/>.
            </li>
            <li>
            	<img src="../../../../img/hof/go-right-place.png" alt="go-right (place)"/> follows the <i>right</i> path, returning
                a new <img src="../../../../img/hof/place-variable.png" alt="place"/>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        	It is an error to <img src="../../../../img/hof/go-left-place.png" alt="go-left (place)"/> or 
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/go-right-place.png" alt="go-right (place)"/>
            if <img src="../../../../img/hof/place-variable.png" alt="place"/> is a dead-end (because it has no paths!).
            There is no way in this forest to follow a sequence of left paths and/or right paths and end up
			where you started. I.e., there’s no way to walk in circles. Your home (if one exists) might be at a
			dead-end or it might not. You might actually start your search at home.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	Write <img src="../../../../img/hof/path-home-place.png" alt="path home (place)"/>, which uses the four functions above and returns
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/true.png" alt="true"/> if you can
			get home following a (possibly zero) number of lefts and rights starting from <br/><img src="../../../../img/hof/place-variable.png" alt="place"/>, and
			<img src="../../../../img/hof/false.png" alt="false"/> otherwise. There is a framework for this block under the "Going Home" sprite in the starter file.
            As before, make sure you have clicked the green flag before testing your block.
            You can write this block entirely with recursion - you won't need HOFs or iteration. Example:

	        <h3>The Road Not Taken</h3>
        	<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>
            And sorry I could not travel both<br/>
            And be one traveler, long I stood<br/>
            And looked down one as far as I could<br/>
            To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
             
            <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br/>
            And having perhaps the better claim,<br/>
            Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br/>
            Though as for that the passing there<br/>
            Had worn them really about the same,</p>
             
            <p>And both that morning equally lay<br/>
            In leaves no step had trodden black.<br/>
            Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br/>
            Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br/>
            I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
             
            <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br/>
            Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>
            Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br/>
            I took the one less traveled by,<br/>
            And that has made all the difference.</p>
