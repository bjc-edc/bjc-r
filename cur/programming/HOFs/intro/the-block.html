There are two powerful programming ideas we want you to take away from this course.  The first is recursion.  The second is that program elements &mdash; blocks and scripts &mdash; can be used as <i>data</i>.  You'll see in a moment what that means, and you'll see very shortly why it's a powerful idea.

How do we use a block or script as data?  If we just put the block or script into our program, it'll be used as an <i>action</i>; that is, BYOB will just perform whatever computation the block or script calls for.  We have to <i>encapsulate</i> the block or script, which is a fancy way to say "wrap it up."  BYOB provides two "wrapper" blocks, called <b>the block</b> and <b>the script</b>.  Right now we're going to work on blocks as data, so we use <b>the block</b>, which you'll find in the Operators menu.

<b>The block</b> takes a block as input, and reports the block itself.  Compare these two interactions and you'll see what that means:
