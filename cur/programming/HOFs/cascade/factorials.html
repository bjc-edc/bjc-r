CASCADE has one, too, and it means the same thing for both of them: You can drag the # into the reporter block you're using as input to MAP or CASCADE, and it represents how many times the reporter block has been called. So, the first time MAP or CASCADE calls the reporter, # has the value 1; the second time it's 2; and so on. We can use this to compute the product of the numbers from 1 to a given number:<br><p></p>
