It computes a function of each item of the list and report a list of resulting values. The first figure below is an abstract representation of how map would apply to an arbitrary function <b>fn</b>; the others are examples of how to use <b>map</b>. You'll notice that at the left end of the map block is an orange circle containing a number sign. Ignore that for now; it's a rarely-used feature that we'll get back to later. <br><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/hof/function-maps-over-list-diagram.png" alt="abstract map block with general function" title="abstract map block with general function" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab19/Lab19-2.png"></div>

<p> </p> <br><h3> Try these yourself! </h3> Try out the examples above to help you get more familiarized with map, then try these exercises.<br><br>Make the "first-letters" block that was introduced using map.<br><p> </p> Given any list of numbers as an input, use map to add each of those numbers in the list by ten.
<p> </p> Given any list of words as an input, use map to to add a letter "s" to the end of those words in the list.   </body></html>
