<p> Okay, now we knowing that there is a winning move for the computer, but knowing that there is a winning move isn't much help unless we know where it is. Modify the i-can-win? block so that if there is a winning move, return the square. <br><br> It would also help if you wrote a <i>choose-win?</i> block that takes in the <span style="font-style: italic;">winning triples</span> and returns false if the given input is an empty list - otherwise it returns back the winning square (a number, NOT A LIST). </p>
