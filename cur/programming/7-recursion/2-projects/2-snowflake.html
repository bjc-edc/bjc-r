        <h2>Koch Snowflake</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will use recursion to draw the <strong>Koch snowflake</strong>.<br />

        <div class="sidenote">The <em>ch</em> in Koch is like <em>ch</em> in Bach, or the Spanish pronunciation of <em>x</em> in Mexico or Xavier, or the <em>j</em> in Alejandra, or like the Yiddish pronunciation of <em>ch</em> in chutzpah.</div>
        <p>
            The Koch snowflake consists of three copies of the <strong>Koch curve</strong>, arranged along the sides of a triangle:<br />

        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike <code>tree</code> and <code>triangle fractal</code>, this one does not return the sprite to the same place after each recursive call. It replaces a straight line with a bent line.<br />

        <p>
        	The base case is just a line: <br />

        </p>
        <p>
            At each next level, the algorithm draws four copies of the previous level, each one third the length of the previous level, arranged this way. (The red shows a smaller version of the previous level.)<br />

            <div class="sidenoteBig">The red color was added here to make the previous level more visible. Your version should be all one color for now. (You can experiment with color when you are finished.)</div>

                    These pictures are closely related to the Koch curve. See if you can generate pictures like these by changing the turning angles.<br />
