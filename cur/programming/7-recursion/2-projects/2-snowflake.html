        <h2>Koch Snowflake</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>PG: Koch and LÃ©vi are related and give practice with each other. I love them both, and they do "teach" something new, but I feel (again) like we're doing more of a survey of fractals than learning about recursion.  I'd have to work through more carefully, but I feel like we're rushing to "cover" the field.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="sidenote">The <em>ch</em> in Koch is like <em>ch</em> in Bach, or the Spanish pronunciation of <em>x</em> in Mexico or Xavier, or the <em>j</em> in Alejandra, or like the Yiddish pronunciation of <em>ch</em> in chutzpah.</div>
        <p>
            This fractal is called the <strong>Koch snowflake</strong>:<br />

        </p>
        <p>
            The Koch snowflake consists of three copies of the <strong>Koch curve</strong>, arranged along the sides of a triangle:<br />

        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike <code>tree</code> and <code>triangle fractal</code>, this one does not return the sprite to the same place after each recursive call. It replaces a straight line with a bent line.<br />

        </p>
        <p>
        	The base case is just the line: <br />

        </p>
        <p>
            At the next level, the straight line is replaced by four lines, each one third the length of the parent, arranged this way. <br />

            Each new level replaces the straight lines of the previous level with bent lines, exactly the same way. <br /> 
            <div class="sidenoteBig">The red color was added here to make the previous level more visible. Your version can be all one color.</div>

                <li>When you get one side of the snowflake working, combine three of them to  make the entire snowflake.</li>

                    These pictures are closely related to the Koch curve. See if you can generate pictures like these by changing the turning angles.<br />
