		<h2>Triangle Fractal</h2>
        <div class="todo">Does it make sense to have this page at all given that they already built a recursive triangle in U2? What's actually new here? We can teach <code>wrap</code> on the next page. --MF, 6/19/20</div>

            <div class="todo">BH, this is new. Please review and then remove this comment. --MF, 6/19/20</div>
            <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will create several recursive, fractal-drawing procedures.</p>

            <p>PG: Change. The follow-up that leads to competency (abstraction of the principles so that kids can do new things of /their/ invention) is the "if there is time" and embedded non-triangles (squares, pentagons, hexagons). I feel like we're moving from thing to thing without building kids' ability to be independent. The TIF is about animation, not actual extension of the ideas kids are already dealing with. Yes, A is about varying the angle, a worthy thing, but our LAB is about recursion, and kids are not reapplying THAT idea here at all.</p>

        <h3>Growing the Triangle into the Fractal</h3>
        <p>
            <code>triangle</code> is the base case. You can modify it, or create a new block with <var>level</var> and <var>size</var> inputs just like <code>tree</code>:<br />
        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tri-frac-1-head.png" alt="triangle fractal level: (level #) size: (size #)" title="triangle fractal level: (level #) size: (size #)" />
        </p>
        <p>
            If the level is 1, we should see only the  triangle:<br />

        <div class="comment">Paul, do you not like my click-for-comment on principle? --bh</div>
        <p>
            Otherwise, a half-size child buds at the end of each side of the parent. At level 2, it should look like this:<br />
            <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tri-frac-1-level-2.png" alt="Triangle fractal level 2 drawing: triangle with 3 smaller triangles on its vertices" title="Triangle fractal level 2 drawing: triangle with 3 smaller triangles on its vertices" />
		</p>
        <p>
        And at level 3, you should see this:<br />
        <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tri-frac-1-level-3.png" alt="Triangle fractal level 3 drawing: triangle with 3 smaller triangles on its vertices each of which in turn have 3 smaller triangles on their vertices" title="Triangle fractal level 3 drawing: triangle with 3 smaller triangles on its vertices each of which in turn have 3 smaller triangles on their vertices" /></p>

                            Your finished product should have produced a shape sort of like this:<br />

                        <p>but with lots of small line segments instead of the grey parts. This should suggest an alternate way to make the shape: Level 1 is a triangle, level 2 is three level-1 versions arrayed around an empty triangle, etc. Write the code for that and compare the two results.</p>

                    <div class="todo">I couldn't get the fractal in this second problem right without help from Brian, and it turned out to be that I was being too logical. In the problems above, the smaller triangles were half-size. I assumed that to be the case here (though perhaps I should have assumed third-size)&mdash;especially because the very next problem specifies <span class="katex">\frac{size}{\sqrt{3}}</span>, so obviously that's not what would we want here (but it turns out that's the only factor that gives the level 8 image below.) --MF</div>

                        <p>If you compare the level 2 picture with the one from the previous page, you'll see that the basic idea is the same: Stick little triangles at the corners of big ones. But they're stuck together slightly differently.</p>

                    <div class="todo">After Brian corrected me on the <span class="katex">\frac{size}{\sqrt{3}}</span> thing on the problem above and my misinterpretation of the instruction "turn 30 degrees left after drawing each side and before the recursive call" on the problem below to mean that the <code>turn left</code> block should have an input of 30, I now have two identical scripts for these two seemingly separate problems. --MF</div>
                    <li>This time, instead of balancing the smaller triangles symmetrically on the corners of the bigger triangle, turn 30 degrees left after drawing each side and before the recursive call, and use <span class="katex">\frac{size}{\sqrt{3}}</span> as the size in the recursive call. Then make a level-10 fractal inside a <code>warp</code> block.  (Find it in the Control palette.)</li>
