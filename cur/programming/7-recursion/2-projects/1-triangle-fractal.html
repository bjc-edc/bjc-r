            <ul>
                <li>make this all one block instead of two</li>
                <li>explicitly have them change the color of the block</li>
                <li>and explain why that's helpful (to make the recursive call visible)</li>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
	      <li>Open your project "U3L1-FractalArt"; save it as "U7L2-TriangleFractal".</li>
              <li>Run 
        	<img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/old-nested-triangle.png" alt="nested triange, size: (175)" title="nested triange, size: (175)" />.  Then look inside the block and remind yourself and your partner how it works.</li>
	      <li><strong>Predict</strong> how the shape will change if you change the 9 in <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/size-gt-9.png" alt="(size)&gt;(9)" title="(size)>&gt;(9)" /> to 2 and run the instruction again.  Then try it and see if it does what you expect.
                <div class="endnote">
                    The <code>warp</code> block (in the yellow Control palette) makes the script inside it run faster by not letting any other scripts run or updating the display until it's finished.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/warped-175.png" alt="warp{nested triangle, size:(175)}" title="warp{nested triangle, size:(175)}" />
                </div>
		</li>
		<li>Then set the value from 2 back to 9.</li>
	     </ol>
	</div>

<p>The expression <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/size-gt-9.png" alt="(size)>(9)" title="(size)>(9)" /> sets the <em>base case</em> of the recursion in the <code>nested triangle</code> block.  But using the <var>size</var> input to control the depth of the recursion isn't very satisfactory.  For example, when you tried <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/old-nested-triangle.png" alt="nested triangle, size: (175)" title="nested triangle, size: (175)" /> you may have thought, "That's an interesting picture, but it's too big to fit on the stage.  Let me try size 100 instead."  If you actually tried it, were you disappointed in the result?</p>

	<div class="forYouToDo">
	  <ol start="5">
	    <li>
	    If you didn't try it then, try it now.
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	</div>

	<p>You already know a better way to control the recursion: have another input, <var>level</var>, to control the depth of the recursion separately from the overall size of the picture.  That's what you did in the tree fractal.</p>

	<div class="forYouToDo">
	  <ol start="6">
	    <li>
	    Make a block <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tri-fract-block.png" alt="triangle fractal, level: ( ) size: ()" title="triangle fractal, level: ( ) size: ()" />.  You can use the code of your existing <code>nested triangle</code> block as a starting point.
	    </li>
	    <li>Try several <code>triangle fractal</code> drawings, all with <var>size</var> 100, but with values of <var>level</var> from 1 up to 10.  Make sure they do what you expected.</li>
              <li>
                   Your block makes the recursive call between the <code>move</code> and the <code>turn</code> of the larger triangle.  Try some modifications like these:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/triangle-fractal-variation01.png" alt="repeat(3){move(size) steps; turn clockwise (120) degrees; triangle fractal level:(level-1) size:(size*0.5)}" title="repeat(3){move(size) steps; turn clockwise (120) degrees; triangle fractal level:(level-1) size:(size*0.5)}" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/triangle-fractal-variation02.png" alt="repeat(3){move(size) steps; turn clockwise (120) degrees; triangle fractal level:(level-1) size:(size*0.5); turn clockwise(60) degrees}" title="repeat(3){move(size) steps; turn clockwise (120) degrees; triangle fractal level:(level-1) size:(size*0.5); turn clockwise(60) degrees}" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/triangle-fractal-variation03.png" alt="repeat(3){move(size) steps; turn counter-clockwise (30) degrees; triangle fractal level:(level-1) size:(size*0.5); turn clockwise(150) degrees}" title="repeat(3){move(size) steps; turn counter-clockwise (30) degrees; triangle fractal level:(level-1) size:(size*0.5); turn clockwise(150) degrees}" />
                </li>
		<li>Generalize your procedure by adding an input:<br />
		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/poly-fract.png" alt="polygon fractal, level: ( ) number of sides: ( ) size: ()" title="polygon fractal, level: ( ) number of sides: ( ) size: ()" />.

		<div class="takeItFurther">
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Use <code>for</code> to make a triangle animation that cycles through different turning angle arrangements (that is, 0&deg; and 120&deg;, then 1&deg; and 119&deg;, then 2&deg; and 118&deg;, etc.).</li>
                <li>Experiment with the scale factor for the <var>size</var> of the recursive calls.  A couple of interesting values are <span class="katex">\frac{<var>1</var>}{3}</span> and <span class="katex">\frac{<var>1</var>}{\sqrt{3}}</span>.</li>

                        <p>
                            Your finished product should have produced a shape sort of like this:<br />

                        </p>
                        <p>but with lots of small line segments instead of the grey parts. This should suggest an alternate way to make the shape: Level 1 is a triangle, level 2 is three level-1 versions arrayed around an empty triangle, etc. Write the code for that and compare the two results.</p>
                    </li>
                    <div class="todo">I couldn't get the fractal in this second problem right without help from Brian, and it turned out to be that I was being too logical. In the problems above, the smaller triangles were half-size. I assumed that to be the case here (though perhaps I should have assumed third-size)&mdash;especially because the very next problem specifies <span class="katex">\frac{size}{\sqrt{3}}</span>, so obviously that's not what would we want here (but it turns out that's the only factor that gives the level 8 image below.) --MF</div>

                        <p>
                            Okay, no hints this time. Level 1 is an equilateral triangle. Here are levels 2 and 3:<br />

                        <p>
                            And here's level 8:<br />

                        <p>If you compare the level 2 picture with the one from the previous page, you'll see that the basic idea is the same: Stick little triangles at the corners of big ones. But they're stuck together slightly differently.</p>
                    </li>
                    <div class="todo">After Brian corrected me on the <span class="katex">\frac{size}{\sqrt{3}}</span> thing on the problem above and my misinterpretation of the instruction "turn 30 degrees left after drawing each side and before the recursive call" on the problem below to mean that the <code>turn left</code> block should have an input of 30, I now have two identical scripts for these two seemingly separate problems. --MF</div>
                    <li>This time, instead of balancing the smaller triangles symmetrically on the corners of the bigger triangle, turn 30 degrees left after drawing each side and before the recursive call, and use <span class="katex">\frac{size}{\sqrt{3}}</span> as the size in the recursive call. Then make a level-10 fractal inside a <code>warp</code> block.  (Find it in the Control palette.)</li>
