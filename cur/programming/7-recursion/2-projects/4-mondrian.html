                    <p>It's like a fractal in that the picture is made up of smaller pictures of the same kind.  But, because of the use of randomness, the smaller pictures don't look quite like the big one.  A fractal is "self-similar," which means that it looks just like a piece of itself.</p>

            Mondrian did not use a computer, but we can use recursion to <em>model</em> his paintings and create similar images. The base case is one rectangle with a black border around it. That's more complicated than any base case you have worked with before, so you'll use an abstraction called <code>rectangle</code> to hide the drawing script for the base case.<br />

                        There is a block for the base case, <code>rectangle</code>, and a block for the complete recursive procedure, <code>Mondrian</code>.<br />

                                    <strong>It will be easier to think about your code if <code>rectangle</code> and <code>Mondrian</code> are state invariant.</strong> The sprite should end up in the same position and direction as it started. Check for this in each piece of code (that is, in <code>rectangle</code> and in each branch of the <code>if</code> statement inside <code>Mondrian</code>).

                                        <li>It's harder to keep your code state invariant if you move to a particular place or turn in a particular direction, such as by using <code>go to</code>, <code>set x</code>, <code>set y</code>, or <code>point in direction</code>. Instead, use blocks like <code>turn &#8635;</code>, <code>turn &#8634;</code>, and <code>move</code> so that you can undo these changes before leaving that piece of code.</li>

                                        <li>If you sometimes rotate 90 degrees before a recursive call to <code>Mondrian</code>, you may need to swap <var>width</var> and <var>height</var> in the recursive call. This is possible but can be confusing to think through.</li>
