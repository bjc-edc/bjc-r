                    <p>They're like fractals in that the picture is made up of smaller pictures of the same kind.  But, because of the use of randomness, the smaller pictures don't look quite like the big one.  A fractal is "self-similar," which means that it looks just like a piece of itself.</p>

            Mondrian did not use a computer, but you can use recursion to <em>model</em> his paintings and create similar images. The base case is one rectangle with a black border around it. That's more complicated than any base case you have worked with before, so you'll use an abstraction called <code>rectangle</code> to hide the drawing script for the base case.<br />

                        There are partially written blocks for the base case, <code>rectangle</code>, and for the complete recursive procedure, <code>Mondrian</code>.<br />

                        <strong>It will be easier to think about your code if <code>rectangle</code> and <code>Mondrian</code> are state invariant.</strong> The sprite should end up in the same position and direction as it started. Check for this in each piece of code (that is, in <code>rectangle</code> and in each branch of the <code>if</code> statement inside <code>Mondrian</code>).
                        <ul>
                          <li>If any piece of your code (such as <code>rectangle</code> or one branch of an <code>if</code>) turns, the sprite should finish facing in the same direction in which it started.</li>
                          <li>It's harder to keep your code state invariant if you move to a particular place or turn in a particular direction, such as by using <code>go to</code>, <code>set x</code>, <code>set y</code>, or <code>point in direction</code>. Instead, use blocks like <code>turn &#8635;</code>, <code>turn &#8634;</code>, and <code>move</code> so that you can undo these changes before leaving that piece of code.</li>

                          <li>If your first recursive call moves <code>width × fraction</code>, make sure the second call moves through <code>width × (1 - fraction)</code>.</li>
                          <li>If you sometimes rotate 90 degrees before a recursive call to <code>Mondrian</code>, you may need to swap <var>width</var> and <var>height</var> in the recursive call. This is possible but can be confusing to think through.</li>

                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Look at <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/piet-mondrian/all-works#!#filterName:Style_neoplasticism,resultType:masonry">some actual Mondrian paintings</a> and count how many rectangles he used in each. (If you visit other pages, make sure you are looking at actual Mondrians and not imitations, of which there are very many on the Web.)
            Think about what <var>level</var> input makes your pictures look as much like Mondrian's as possible.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
		<div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="8">
				<li>
					So far on this page, you've used only primary colors (red, yellow, and blue) plus black and white. Mondrian used these colors in most of his geometric paintings, with only occasional use of softer colors.  But now you're the artist, and you can use different colors if you prefer.  Why do you think Mondrian chose these intense colors?  If you like, do some research to find out.

						<a href="#hint-rgb" data-toggle="collapse" title="Aren't the primary colors red, <em>green,</em> and blue?">Aren't the primary colors red, <em>green,</em> and blue?</a>
						<div id="hint-rgb" class="collapse">
						<p>Color is complicated.  When mixing different colors of light, as your computer display does, you use red, green, and blue.  But when mixing <em>paint</em> colors, you use red, yellow, and blue as primary.</p></div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>Do a careful comparison of your program's paintings and Mondrian's.  How faithful is this algorithm (dividing a rectangle, and dividing each piece recursively) to the way Mondrian used lines to divide his canvas?  The random choice of color in each rectangle sometimes uses the same color in rectangles next to each other.  Is that something you see in Mondrian's work?  Think about how your program could be improved.  (That is, for each problem you notice, what specific changes to the code would help?)</li>
			</ol>
        </div>
        <p>These geometric paintings came near the end of Mondrian's career.  He started out painting realistic landscapes, and moved to greater and greater abstraction over time.
