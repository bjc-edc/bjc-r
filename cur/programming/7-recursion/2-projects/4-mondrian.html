            <p>PG: And, of course, I'd be inconsistent here if I said keep this, though I love the project. Here, too, I'd want to check the supports. I'm really not sure we've done enough to prepare students to be able to /do/ this with confidence and independence. Of course, it should be a challenge, but one that /we/ are confident they can manage. Otherwise, we're teaching them that they /can't/ program and that CS is really /not/ for them.  If we're going to do pages 2-5 here, we need to have done much more earlier (which, of course, I think we /should/ do).</p>

                    <p>It's like a fractal in that the picture is made up of smaller pictures of the same kind.  But, because of the use of randomness, the smaller pictures don't look quite like the big one.  A fractal is "self-similar," which means that it looks just like a piece of itself.</p>

                	<div class="comment">PG: There's no time to fix this now, but this is <em>so</em> scaffolded that the only work the student is left to do is <em>not</em> about the recursion. The recursion is harder here, but that's what the lesson should be about. Instead, learning about recursion is sidestepped. The student chooses numbers—an exercise in fractions—but never needs even to look at the structure and does no actual programming beyond the base case, a Unit 1 task. In revision, reverse the scaffolding. Also not clear why we have the scripts with hat blocks. This is all stuff the student can do. </div>

                    Finish programming the base case, the <code>rectangle</code> block. Use a line of color with a pen size the width of the rectangle to paint the inside and then create the black border. Maintain state transparency.

                    <div class="todo">I couldn't figure out how we'd write the starter project with <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/set-flag-flat-line-ends.png" alt="set flag(Flat line ends) to (true)" title="set flag(Flat line ends) to (true)" /> build in.

                    Click "r" a few times to be sure you have <code>rectangle</code> set up correctly. Each time, you should get a big rectangle with one of the five colors inside and a black border, like this:<br />

						Then, program the code for the recursive case. The <code>Mondrian</code> block already contains some structure. Your job is to figure out what inputs it will need based on how the script should work.  
                        <ul>
							<li>You've already seen level 1, a filled-in rectangle. At each level, <code>Mondrian</code> subdivides the space it has into <em>two</em> rectangles (which will further subdivide if more levels are required). For example, in level 2, <code>Mondrian</code> will randomly divide the area specified by its <var>width</var> and <var>height</var> inputs in two pieces, and draw a <code>rectangle</code> in each piece.  For level 3, <code>Mondrian</code> uses a level-2 <code>Mondrian</code> to subdivide the two smaller rectangles (for a total of four filled-in rectangles).  Level 4 will subdivide again, creating eight rectangles, and so on.<div class="todo">Too long to read. Seems more confusing than it is. --MF, 7/5/20</div>
</li>
                            <li>The <var>fraction</var> variable will contain a random fraction between 1/5 and 4/5, specifying how to subdivide the area at this level. <div class="todo">Yeah, this might be over scaffolded. I'd back this off a little, but not a lot. --MF, 7/5/20</div>
</li>
                            <li>The algorithm decides whether to subdivide the width or the height. <div class="todo">I'd rather spec this: "If the width is bigger subdivide the width; if the height is bigger subdivide the height." or just "The algorithm should subdivide whichever is greater." Something like that, no? And not give them the pic. I suggest we do this whole thing with specs and hints and no pic. --MF, 7/5/20</div>

                        </ul>

                    Click "space" a few times. When you have <code>Mondrian</code> working, it should produce pictures like this:<br />
