		<h2>Recursive Mondrian</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>PG: And, of course, I'd be inconsistent here if I said keep this, though I love the project. Here, too, I'd want to check the supports. I'm really not sure we've done enough to prepare students to be able to /do/ this with confidence and independence. Of course, it should be a challenge, but one that /we/ are confident they can manage. Otherwise, we're teaching them that they /can't/ program and that CS is really /not/ for them.  If we're going to do pages 2-5 here, we need to have done much more earlier (which, of course, I think we /should/ do).<br />Generic editing: I find the constantly flicking gifs enormously distracting, annoying and, frankly, show-offy. Two /static/ pictures—or three if we desperately need them—are enough. The constant motion is like these distracting pop-up ads, and serves only to show off how clever we all are.  Please let us let the /students/ be the clever ones who show off /their/ creations without having to compete with ours.</p>

            Mondrian did not use a computer, but we can use recursion to <em>model</em> his paintings and create similar images:<br />
            <div class="sidenoteBig">The corners of the outside border in this picture are missing. This happens when you  choose "Flat line ends" from the settings menu <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/settings-menu.png" alt="the settings icon" title="the settings icon"> and use a large pen size, as we did for this project. You will probably want to change that setting back for other projects.</div>

                	<div class="comment">PG: There's no time to fix this now, but this is <em>so</em> scaffolded that the only work the student is left to do is <em>not</em> about the recursion. The recursion is harder here, but that's what the lesson should be about. Instead, learning about recursion is sidestepped. The student chooses numbers—an exercise in fractions—but never needs even to look at the structure and does no actual programming beyond the base case, a Unit 1 task. In revision, reverse the scaffolding. Also not clear why we have the scripts with hat blocks. This is all stuff the student can do. </div> <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/7-recursion/U7L2-Mondrian.xml" target="_blank"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/load-save.png" alt="Click here to load this file. Then save it to your Snap! account." title="Click here to load this file. Then save it to your Snap! account."></a><br /> Some blocks are already created for you and the script that calls <code>Mondrian</code> is already set up.
                </li>
                <li>
					First, finish programming the base case, the <code>rectangle</code> block. Use a line of color with a pen size the width of the rectangle to paint the inside and then create the black border. Maintain state transparency.
                    <div class="endnote">The <code>rectangle</code> block already contains two custom blocks for you to use. Look inside these two custom blocks to see how they work. <!-- <var>Colors</var> is set up before the outer call to <code>Mondrian</code>, like this:<br />
                        <img src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/set-colors.png" alt="set (color) to {(set pen color to red), (set pen color to yellow), (set pen color to blue), (set pen color to white), (set pen color to black)}" title="set (color) to {(set pen color to red), (set pen color to yellow), (set pen color to blue), (set pen color to white), (set pen color to black)}" /> -->
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click "r" a few times to be sure you have <code>rectangle</code> set up correctly. Each time, you should get a big rectangle with one of the five colors inside and a black border, like this:<br />
                    <img class="indent noshadow" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/mondrian-base-case-animation.gif" alt="Mondrian base case pictures" title="Mondrian base case pictures" />

						<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/take-turns-speaking-mini.gif" alt="Take turns speaking" title="Take turns speaking">
						Then, program the code for the recursive case. The <code>Mondrian</code> block already contains some structure. Your job is to figure out what inputs it will need based on how the script should work.  
                        <ul>
							<li>You've already seen level 1, a filled-in rectangle. At each level, <code>Mondrian</code> subdivides the space it has into <em>two</em> rectangles (which will further subdivide if more levels are required). For example, in level 2, <code>Mondrian</code> will randomly divide the area specified by its <var>width</var> and <var>height</var> inputs in two pieces, and draw a <code>rectangle</code> in each piece.  For level 3, <code>Mondrian</code> uses a level-2 <code>Mondrian</code> to subdivide the two smaller rectangles (for a total of four filled-in rectangles).  Level 4 will subdivide again, creating eight rectangles, and so on.</li>
                            <li>The <var>fraction</var> variable will contain a random fraction between 1/5 and 4/5, specifying how to subdivide the area at this level. </li>
                            <li>The algorithm decides whether to subdivide the width or the height. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Click "space" a few times. When you have <code>Mondrian</code> working, it should produce pictures like this:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/mondrian-animation.gif" alt="Mondrian pictures" title="Mondrian pictures" />

                	Recursion is not just for <em>commands</em> either. You'll learn about recursive <em>reporters</em> in Unit 8. For example, this block reports the factorial of a number. Can you see how it works?<br />
