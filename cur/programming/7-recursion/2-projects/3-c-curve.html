		<h2>Lévy C-Curve Fractal</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will use recursion to draw the Lévy C-curve.</p>
        </div>
                
        <div class="sidenote">Lévy is pronounced lay-VEE.</div>
        <p>
            As in the snowflake algorithm, the base case for the Lévy C-curve is a single line segment:<br />

        </p>
        <p>
            At each next level, the algorithm draws two copies of the previous level, some percentage of the length of the previous level, and arranged in a right angle as shown below. (As before, the red shows a smaller version of the previous level.) You'll have to figure out how much smaller the <var>size</var> input should be in the recursive calls.<br />

                    The original line is replaced by two other lines. Together, the three would form a right triangle with the original line as the hypotenuse. That is, what are the lengths of the legs (the two lines shown)?

            In the third level, the sprite again replaces each straight line with a pair of lines for a total of four smaller lines. Notice that the second and third lines form one long line. The red color here makes that visible. Your version should be all one color for now.<br />
