            It seemed to make sense to replace all the look-alike numbered tree scripts with a single recursive script with the same structure:<br />

        <!-- 	<p>We first tried to build the recursive tree by using the same script as for <code>tree2</code>, <code>tree3</code>, etc. and replacing the call to a lower-level tree with a call to <code>tree</code> itself but with a lower level input, like this:<br />

            </div>
        	<div>
                <span>Alphie:</span> It never stops!

                <span>Gamal:</span> After it turns to the left, it should make a smaller tree, but then it's <em>supposed</em> to finish and turn to the right and do a tree, there, too.

        	<div>
                <span>Betsy:</span> Oh, <em>right</em>, Gamal! It's not going <em>right</em>!

        	<div>
                <span>Gamal:</span> Yeah, in each recursive call to <code>tree</code>, the sprite draws smaller and smaller left branches until it seems to be just spinning around in one place. It never draws a right branch to finish the tree it's working on.
			</div>
        	<div>
                <span>Alphie:</span> I get it. The original numbered <code>tree 1</code>, <code>tree 2</code>, etc. blocks <em>aren't</em> all the same. The first one, <code>tree 1</code>, is different; it just draws a line, <em>no branches</em>, and puts the sprite back where it started.
                <p> 
                	<em>Alphie points to the <code>tree 1</code> code and to the figure it draws.</em><br />

        	<div>
                <span>Betsy:</span> <strong>So our recursive <code>tree</code> block has to do something <em>different</em> when the <var>level = 1</var>!</strong>
            </div>
        	<div>
                <span>Gamal:</span> Yup! It has to draw just a line without adding another branch.
            </div>

			<div class="takeNote">This different version for the lowest level of a recursive script is called the <strong>base case</strong>.</div>

            <div>
                <span>Betsy:</span> Let's think through a simple tree to figure out how this "base case" needs to work. Let's look at <code>tree 3</code> with size 40.<br />
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-3-script.png" alt="tree 3 size:(size#){move(size) steps; turn counterclockwise (25) degrees; tree 2 size:(size*0.65); turn clockwise(25) degrees; turn clockwise(35) degrees; tree 2 size:(size*0.85); turn counterclockwise (35); move(-1*size) steps}" title="tree 3 size:(size#){move(size) steps; turn counterclockwise (25) degrees; tree 2 size:(size*0.65); turn clockwise(25) degrees; turn clockwise(35) degrees; tree 2 size:(size*0.85); turn counterclockwise (35); move(-1*size) steps}">
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree3-call.png" alt="clear; point in direction (0); pen down; tree 3 size:(40)" title="clear; point in direction (0); pen down; tree 3 size:(40)"  />
            </div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Ok, after clearing the stage, pointing up, and putting the pen down, the sprite will move 40 steps and then turn 25&deg; left. And then it will call <code>tree 2</code> with a smaller size.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Right. And <code>tree 2</code>, which is almost the same,  will move, turn, and then call <code>tree 1</code>, which <em>just draws a line and goes back</em>. Then, <code>tree 2</code> tells the sprite to turn right 60&deg; and draw another little <code>tree 1</code> and.... </div>
            <div> <span>Gamal:</span> Yeah, and because <code>tree 1</code> finishes, <em>that lets <code>tree 2</code> finish!</em> So, it'll look like this when <code>tree 2</code> finishes:</div>
            <div class="stagedir"><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree3-drawing-partial.jpg" height="100" alt="drawing of tree 3 after the first tree 2 is called" title="drawing of tree 3 after the first tree 2 is called" /></div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Yup. And then the <code>tree 3</code> script turns right 60&deg; and uses the whole <code>tree 2</code> script again to create the other side. Then it'll turn back 35&deg; and move backwards to the very beginning.</div>
            <div class="stagedir"><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree3-drawing-complete.jpg" alt="drawing of tree3 after the second tree 2 is called" title="drawing of tree 3 after the second tree 2 is called" /></div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> So that's how <code>tree 3</code> finishes. Now, about that "base case" thing for the recursive <code>tree</code> script... The base case is the lowest level of the recursion, so that's like the <code>tree 1</code>. </div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Yeah, the <code>tree 1</code> just draws a line and doesn't try to make another tree.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> So, we need our <em>recursive</em> <code>tree</code> block to draw a line at level 1 instead of making more little trees forever.</div>

                    Correct your recursive <code>tree</code> block so it includes a base case to stop the script from calling itself forever. Here are  two ways you could do that, and there are more. Use whatever makes most sense to you.<br />

                <li>
                	Run <code>tree level: 9 size: 50</code>. If it is now working properly, you should get a result like this:<br />

                </li>
                <li>The time it takes to draw the tree increases <em>very</em> quickly with the number of levels, so we don't recommend trying 20 levels. But try timing level 8 through level 12.</li>

            <p><em>Recursive</em> scripts call themselves. In order for them to stop, there must be some special case when they <em>don't</em> call themselves. We call that  the <strong>base case</strong>, a simpler version of the script that <em>doesn't call the block itself</em>.</p>
            <p>There is usually a <em>conditional</em> (like <code>if-else</code>) with two cases: a <em>base case</em> for the lowest level that stops the recursion from going on forever and a <strong>recursive case</strong> that calls the script itself again and again at lower levels until it reaches the base case.</p>
            <p>When a script <em>does</em> keep recursively calling itself forever (as when the sprite was just spinning around in one place), that's a bug, and we say the program is stuck in an <strong>infinite loop</strong>.</p>
