        	<div>
                <span>Betsy:</span> Yeah! It's not making it to the right side at all.

        	<div>
                <span>Gamal:</span> Hmmm, in each recursive call to <code>tree</code>, the sprite draws smaller and smaller left branches until it seems to be just spinning around in one place. It never turns right to finish the tree it's working on.
			</div>
        	<div>
                <span>Alphie:</span> Hey look! The <code>tree 1</code> block is different from the others; it just draws a line, <em>no branches</em>, and it puts the sprite back where it started.

        	<div>
                <span>Betsy:</span> So our recursive <code>tree</code> block has to do something <em>different</em> at the lowest level!
            </div>
        	<div>
                <span>Gamal:</span> Yup! It has to draw just a line without adding another branch.

                <p>This different version for the lowest level of a recursive script is called the <strong>base case</strong>.</p>

                <span>Betsy:</span> Let's think through a simple tree to figure out how this "base case" needs to work. Let's look at <code>tree 3</code> with size 40.<br />

            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Ok, after clearing the stage, pointing up, and putting the pen down, the sprite will move 40 steps and then turn 25 degrees left. And then it will call <code>tree 2</code> with a smaller size.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Right. And <code>tree 2</code>, which is almost the same,  will move, turn, and then call <code>tree 1</code>, which <em>just draws a line and goes back</em>. Then, <code>tree 2</code> tells the sprite to turn right 60&deg; and draw another little <code>tree 1</code> and.... </div>
            <div> <span>Gamal:</span> Yeah, and because <code>tree 1</code> finishes, <em>that lets <code>tree 2</code> finish!</em> Here, let's draw out what has happened by the time the first <code>tree 2</code> finishes:</div>
            <div class="stagedir"><img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree3-drawing-partial.jpg" height="100" alt="drawing of tree 3 after the first tree 2 is called" title="drawing of tree 3 after the first tree 2 is called" /></div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Yup. And then the <code>tree 3</code> script turns right a total of 60 degrees and then uses the whole <code>tree 2</code> script again to create the other side. And finally it'll turn left 35 degrees and move backwards to the very beginning.</div>
            <div class="stagedir"><img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree3-drawing-complete.jpg" alt="drawing of tree3 after the second tree 2 is called" title="drawing of tree 3 after the second tree 2 is called" /></div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> So that's how <code>tree 3</code> finishes. Now, about that "base case" thing for the recursive <code>tree</code> script... The base case is the lowest level of the recursion, so that's like the <code>tree 1</code>. </div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Yeah, the <code>tree 1</code> just draws a line and doesn't try to make another tree.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> So, we need our <em>recursive</em> <code>tree</code> block to draw a line at level 1 instead of making more little trees forever.</div>

            <p><em>Recursive</em> scripts call themselves. In order for them to stop, there must be some special case when they <em>don't</em> call themselves. We call that  the <strong>base case</strong>, a simpler version of the script that <em>doesn't call the block itself</em>.</p>
            <p>There is usually a <em>conditional</em> (like <code>if-else</code>) with two cases: a <em>base case</em> for the lowest level that stops the recursion from going on forever and a <strong>recursive case</strong> that calls the script itself again and again at lower levels until it reaches the base case.</p>
