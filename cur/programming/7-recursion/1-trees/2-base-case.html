            <p><em>Recursive</em> blocks call themselves. In order for
        	them to finish, there must be some special case in which
        	they <em>don't</em> call themselves. That is the <em>base
        	case</em>, a simpler version of the block's script that doesn't call the block itself.</p>
            <p>There is usually a conditional with two cases: a <em>base case</em> for the lowest level that stops the recursion from going on forever and a <em>recursive case</em> that calls the block itself at lower levels until it reaches the base case.</p>
            <p>If a block keeps recursively calling itself forever (as when the sprite was just spinning around in one place), that's a bug, and we say the program is stuck in an <em>infinite loop</em>.</p>
