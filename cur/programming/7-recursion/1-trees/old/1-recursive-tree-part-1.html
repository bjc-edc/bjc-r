		<h2>Recursive Tree, Part 1</h2>	
        <p>
            Our goal is to draw a tree like this:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/real-tree.jpg" alt="goal: tree fractal" title="goal: tree fractal" />
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll start with a simpler version that shows the technique clearly:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/full-recursive-tree-BYOB.jpg" alt="simple tree fractal" title="simple tree fractal" />
        </p>
        <p>
           Notice that the tree is like a <em>fractal</em>, a picture that contains smaller versions of itself:<br />
            <div class="sideHOMbig">Technically, all the images in this unit are just <em>approximations</em> to fractals because the smaller pictures are <em>simpler</em> than the complete picture. In real fractals, the smaller pictures are just as complete; the smaller and smaller branches go on forever to matter how much you zoom in. In these projects, you can imagine that we have infinitely many smaller and smaller branches.</div>

        </p>
        <p>We'll create a <code>tree</code> block in Snap<em>!</em> It'll start with a <code>move</code> block to draw the trunk of the tree, then a <code>turn</code> block turning left, then another <code>tree</code> block to draw the left smaller tree, and so on.</p>
        <div class="takeNote">"Wait!" you may be thinking. "How can we use a <code>tree</code> block <em>inside</em> a <code>tree</code> block? It doesn't exist yet!" That's the big idea for this assignment.</div>
        <p>We're going to work up to the complicated tree starting with very simple steps that don't involve <code>tree</code> within <code>tree</code>.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>	
                <div class="todo">These two steps should be more symmetrical instead of being 3 steps where the 3rd combines everything in the first two and takes it to the next level. Just easier to see the step from <code>tree1</code> to <code>tree2a</code> that way... --MF</div>
                <li>
                    <div class="sidenote">The block <code>tree1 size</code>draws just 1 level of the tree.</div>
                    Make a <code>tree1 size</code> block using this script: <br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree1.png" alt="tree level 1 script" title="tree level 1 script" />
                    <p>This looks simple, but it will get interesting soon. The script draws one tree branch and then moves the sprite back to its original position.</p> 
                    <div class="takeNote">Moving back to the original position is going to be important when we start using scripts within scripts; we always want to be able to assume that our  blocks leave the sprite in the same position and direction as it started in.</div>
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <strong>Point the sprite facing upward</strong>, and put the pen down. Then try <code>tree1 size 50</code>. You should get a result something like this: <br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-level1.png" alt="tree level 1 result" title="tree level 1 result" />
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Make a <code>tree2a size</code> block that draws two levels. <br />
                    <div class="sidenote">You're going to make two different versions of this, so the first one is called <code>tree2a size</code>.</div>
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree2a.png" alt="tree level 2a script" title="tree level 2a script" />
                    <p>
                        When <code>tree2a size 50</code> run, it should give this result:<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-level2.jpg" alt="tree level 2a result" title="tree level 2a result" />
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

		<p>At this rate you'll never be able to make the beautiful version of the tree in this century! In the next step, we'll discuss how to simplify this process.</p>
		<div class="takeNote"><div class="commentBig">I think this would be more effective as a discussion listed in the TG. --MF</div>Before going on, make sure that you can mentally trace through the code provided. Paying close attention to the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks is going to be important to seeing the big picture<!-- and understanding the recursion-->. </div>
        <div class="takeItFurther"><a name="further" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>How many blocks would you need to write <code>tree3a</code> out of Motion blocks similarly to how we wrote <code>tree2a</code>?</li>
                <li>How about <code>tree4a</code>?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
