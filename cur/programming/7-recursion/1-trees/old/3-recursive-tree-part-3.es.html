		<h2>Recursive Tree, Part 3</h2>
        <p>
        	Last time, we tried to generalize this pattern:<br />
        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree2.es.png" alt="tree2">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree3.es.png" alt="tree3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/old/tree4.es.png" alt="tree4"><br />
            by making a single block that took the level number as an <em>input, </em>instead of as part of the block name:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-nobase.es.png" alt="tree script first version">
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, it did not work:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/treebug.gif" alt="picture of failing tree">
        </p>
        <p>The sprite draws smaller and smaller left branches, finally just spinning around in one place, without ever drawing a right branch.</p>
        <p>
            What went wrong? The problem is that the original numbered <code>tree</code> scripts <em>aren't </em>all the same. The first one, <code>tree1</code>, is different; it just draws a trunk, without any branches:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree1.es.png" alt="tree1 script" />
        </p>
        <p>
            So our all-in-one <code>tree</code> block has to do something different from what's now in the script for the case <code>levels=1</code>.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree.es.png" alt="correct tree script" />
        </p>
        <p>
            With this change, we can draw trees of any complexity. Here's a level-9 tree:<br />

        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <div class="commentBig">Are we hoping that they'll use their timing block from U5 or an approach less formal? --MF</div>
                <li>The amount of time required to draw the tree goes up very quickly with the number of levels, so we don't recommend trying 20 levels. Try timing level 8 through level 12.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="todo">Definitions of recursion and base case need to be more clear and upfront. --MF</div>
        <div class="takeNote">This general code pattern, with a simple <em>base case</em> that doesn't call the block itself, is typical of recursion. (<em>Recursion </em>is the name for a block that calls itself in its script.) There's a base case and a recursive case.</div>
