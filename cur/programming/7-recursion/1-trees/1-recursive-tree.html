            <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will create tree-drawing programs that use recursion to draw the branches by drawing smaller and smaller trees.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will explore nesting code for trees inside code for trees.</p>

        <div class="todo">BH, I reviewed this page and resolved my pedagogical concerns with a small change (they don't have to build it. This comment and the following two can be removed if you feel they are resolved. --MF, 6/18/20</div>

        <div class="todo">
            <p>PG: Change. I still have great reservations about the pedagogy. We are telling kids, step by step, how to do something before they have a picture of what they're trying to control. At least two other alternatives: create tree governed by size (as we do in Unit 1 or 2) and embed, /then/ show how one might want to control growth by count rather than size; create tree by abstract model (trunk, branch, and leaf, which is also the base case) showing structural similarities and differences. Neither of these succeeds in getting to the generic "formula"—stop rule dependent on decrementing input, body, recursive call—but, in my mind, that's a culmination, not a place to start.</p>

            The branching pattern on many plants has <em>fractal</em> structure: the smaller parts are like miniature copies of the whole plant. <br />
            <div class="vocab">
                <p>A <strong>fractal</strong> is an infinite repeating pattern made up of copies (or slight variations) of the same shape. In this picture, the green branch is (essentially) the same shape as the entire picture.</p>

                    It doesn't work. Try to debug the script. Consider building the code and running it yourself.
