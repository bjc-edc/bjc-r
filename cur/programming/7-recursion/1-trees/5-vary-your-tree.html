            <p>I've moved what was a separate page ("Fractals in Nature") onto the bottom of this page. --MF, 12/31/19</p>
            <p>This link was commented out, but I like the variety it offers. Why was it commented out? --MF, 12/31/19
                <ul><li>There are some beautiful examples of recursive patterns in nature; see, for instance, <a href="http://www.rainbowskill.com/canteen/beautiful-fractals.php" target="_blank">this collection</a>.</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>I also like this sentence and want to keep it somewhere --MF, 12/31/19
                <ul><li>The computer-generated landscapes and clouds you see in Pixar (and other) films are fractals.</li></ul>

            <p>I think this should be an optional page or perhaps since our "safe to skip" language isn't as relevant after the exam, this should be an optional project at the end of the unit. --MF, 4/3/19 </p>
            <p>I still think this should be listed as skippable (asterisked). Do you agree, Brian? --MF, 12/31/19</p>

                	Experiment! Try varying your tree in the following ways: 
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">You should revert to the original script after each experiment, so that you can always tell exactly what edit in your script relates to the changes on the stage.</div>
                	<ul>
                        <li>Change the turn angle.</li>
                        <li>Change the scale factor.</li>
                        <li>Change the number of branches at each level.</li>
                        <li>Change the branching <em>structure</em>. 
                        	<p>For example,  trees can have  branches along the trunk <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-with-five-branches.png" height="150" alt="tree with two branches at different locations along trunk and three branches at top" title="tree with two branches at different locations along trunk and three branches at top"> or even a bent trunk <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-with-bent-trunk.png"  height="165" alt="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge" title="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge">.</p></li>
                      <div class="endnote">When you use more complicated structures or bend the trunk, returning the sprite to its original position—maintaining state transparency—becomes more of a nuisance. Instead of undoing each move and turn step by step, you can record the starting position like this <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/set-sprite-state.png" width="320" alt="script variables(sprite state); set(sprite state) to (sprite pos and direction); set pen color to (brown)" title="script variables(sprite state); set(sprite state) to (sprite pos and direction); set pen color to (brown)"> </p> <p> using a block like this </p> <p> <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/sprite-pos-and-direction.png" width="372" alt="sprite pos and direction{report(list{x position, y position, direction})}" title="sprite pos and direction{report(list{x position, y position, direction})}"></p> 
                      and build a block <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/return-sprite.png" height="46" alt="return sprite (sprite state)" title="return sprite (sprite state)"> that returns the sprite to its original position.</div>

                    In nature, gravity affects how plants grow. Here is an example of the tree fractal that uses a <code>gravity</code> block to weigh down the branches  roughly the way gravity would. This tree's branching structure looks like <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-with-bent-trunk.png"  height="165" alt="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge" title="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge">. The image below shows what happens when we add gravity. Experiment with this idea or work on whatever alternative you find interesting and beautiful.<br />
