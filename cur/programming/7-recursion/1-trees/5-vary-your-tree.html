                	Experiment! Try varying your tree in the following ways:
                	<ul>
                        <li>Change the turn angle.</li>
                        <li>Change the scale factor.</li>
                        <li>Change the number of branches at each level.</li>
                        <li>
                            Change the branching <em>structure</em>.
							For example, trees can have branches along the trunk <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-with-five-branches.png" height="150" alt="tree with two branches at different locations along trunk and three branches at top" title="tree with two branches at different locations along trunk and three branches at top"> or even a bent trunk <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-with-bent-trunk.png"  height="165" alt="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge" title="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge">.

                            When you use more complicated structures or bend the trunk, returning the sprite to its original position—maintaining state transparency—becomes more of a nuisance. Instead of undoing each move and turn step by step, you can record the starting position like this<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/set-sprite-state.png" alt="script variables(sprite state); set(sprite state) to (sprite pos and direction); set pen color to (brown)" title="script variables(sprite state); set(sprite state) to (sprite pos and direction); set pen color to (brown)"><br />
                            using a block like this<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/sprite-pos-and-direction.png" alt="sprite pos and direction{report(list{x position, y position, direction})}" title="sprite pos and direction{report(list{x position, y position, direction})}"><br />
                            and build a <code>return sprite to state</code> block that returns the sprite to its original position.<br />

                    Change the pen thickness between levels, so that the trunk is really thick and the leaves are thin.<br />

                    In nature, gravity affects how plants grow. Here is an example of the tree fractal that uses a <code>gravity</code> block to weigh down the branches  roughly the way gravity would. This tree's branching structure looks like <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-with-bent-trunk.png"  height="165" alt="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge" title="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge">. The image below shows what happens when we add gravity. Experiment with this idea or work on whatever alternative you find interesting and beautiful.<br />
