		<h2>Vary Your Tree</h2>
		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<ol>
				<li>
                	Experiment! Try varying your tree in the following ways: 
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">You should revert to the original script after each experiment, so that you can always tell exactly what edit in your script relates to the changes on the stage.</div>
                	<ul>
                        <li>Change the turn angle.</li>
                        <li>Change the scale factor.</li>
                        <li>Change the number of branches at each level.</li>
                        <li>Change the branching <em>structure</em>. 
                        	<p>For example,  trees can have  branches along the trunk <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-with-five-branches.png" height="150" alt="tree with two branches at different locations along trunk and three branches at top" title="tree with two branches at different locations along trunk and three branches at top"> or even a bent trunk <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-with-bent-trunk.png"  height="165" alt="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge" title="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge">.</p></li>
                      <div class="endnote">When you use more complicated structures or bend the trunk, returning the sprite to its original position—maintaining state transparency—becomes more of a nuisance. Instead of undoing each move and turn step by step, you can record the starting position like this <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/set-sprite-state.png" width="320" alt="script variables(sprite state); set(sprite state) to (sprite pos and direction); set pen color to (brown)" title="script variables(sprite state); set(sprite state) to (sprite pos and direction); set pen color to (brown)"> </p> <p> using a block like this </p> <p> <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/sprite-pos-and-direction.png" width="372" alt="sprite pos and direction{report(list{x position, y position, direction})}" title="sprite pos and direction{report(list{x position, y position, direction})}"></p> 
                      and build a block <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/return-sprite.png" height="46" alt="return sprite (sprite state)" title="return sprite (sprite state)"> that returns the sprite to its original position.</div>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

        	<ol start="2">
            	<li>Change the pen thickness between levels, so that the trunk is really thick and the leaves are thin.<br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/thicktree.png" alt="tree with thick trunk" title="tree with thick trunk"></li>
