        <p>
            This <a class="run" href="../../../prog/robots/better-finch-remote.xml">starter file</a> contains a different attempt at creating
            a remote control system for the finch. Like before, try pressing the arrow keys and see how the finch behaves
            (you'll need to click the green flag first in this version). Now, look closer at the code and see if you can 
            figure out how it works.
        </p>
        <p>
            One way that this control system is different is that it allows the user to change how fast the finch goes.
            Suppose we wanted to make our finch get faster or slower (accelerate and decelerate) more quickly. Edit the program
            so that it starts by asking the user how much acceleration they want the finch to have (and then gives the finch that
            much acceleration). The values input by the user should be between zero and 100 (bonus: what happens if we input a 
            negative acceleration value?).
