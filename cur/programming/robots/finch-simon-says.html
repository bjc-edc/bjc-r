        <p>
            You've probably played games like Simon Says and Bop-It that involve quickly responding to
            a series of commands.
            This <a class="run" href="../../../prog/robots/finch-simon-says.xml">starter file</a> contains a version of these
            games, using the finch as a controller. In this version of the game,
            you'll be asked to turn the finch in a certain direction, which you must quickly do; otherwise,
            you lose the game (I lost the game!).
            First, try playing the game a couple of times, then
            take a look at the code and see how it works.

            Now that you understand how the program is working, let's make some modifications!
            There are two more orientations that the finch can sense, but that haven't yet been 
            included in the game. Figure out what they are and add them as possibilities!
            Here are a few more ideas to make the game better. Implement your favorites:
            <ul>
                <li>At this point, the game still isn't very exciting. Let's give the user more feedback.
                    Have the finch respond with colors, sounds, or talking when the user does
                    something good or bad.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our game is still kind of mean. Change it so
                    the user can miss more than one command before losing (maybe allow them to specify
                    how many "lives" they get).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Give the user a score, or record their longest streak of correct responses.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
