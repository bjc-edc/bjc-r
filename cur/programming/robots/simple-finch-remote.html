            In the same starter file as on the last slide, click on the "Remote Control" sprite. Explore what happens
            when you press various buttons on your keyboard. You'll notice that
            <img src="../../../img/robots/when-left-arrow-key-pressed.png" alt="When (left-arrow) key pressed"/> and
            <img src="../../../img/robots/when-right-arrow-key-pressed.png" alt="When (right-arrow) key pressed"/> don't have anything attached
            below them. Fill these in so that the finch turns left and right when these keys are pressed.
            While you're at it, make it so the finch's LED turns blue when the "b" key is pressed, and the finch
            plays a note at 880 Hz. for one second when the "2" key is pressed.
