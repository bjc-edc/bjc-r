		<h2>Unit 5: Algorithms and Data</h2>
		<div>
            <p>Hi All, this is a list of the LOs and EKs that I <em>think</em> we'll need to cover in U5. Please note that some of these might be covered elsewhere, as I haven't gotten my AP search script working yet due to other priorities. This is a first pass at this unit based on my handwritten notes, and it is a very long list. So, any that don't belong here, please move to the very bottom. Otherwise, let's use this as a starting point for writing the unit. --MF</p>
