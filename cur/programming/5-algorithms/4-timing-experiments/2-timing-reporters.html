		<h2>Timing Reporters</h2>
		<div class="comment">EK: 4.2.4D, 4.2.4F</div>
		<div class="sidenoteBig">The title of this page has two meanings: You will build a "timing reporter" &hellip; that times reporters.</div>
        <p>Snap<em>!</em> allows us to report how long a program takes to finish.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>In the "Sensing" palette, look for the <code>current (</code><var>date</var><code>)</code> reporter. Drag it into the scripting area.  From its input menu, select <var>time in milliseconds</var>.
                </li>
                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/current-time.png" alt="current (time in milliseconds) reporting 1454091401280" title="current (time in milliseconds) reporting 1454091401280" />
                <li>Click the block several times.  Note the results.

        <p>
            This block can be used to time how long a reporter takes to output. Here’s an algorithm:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Create a variable <var>start time</var> and set it to the current time.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Call the reporter that you're trying to time.  Ignore the result.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> When the reporter finishes, get the current time and subtract <var>start time</var> from it.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="3">
                <li>Download <a target="_blank" href="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/U5L3functiontimer.xml">this library</a> and save it on your desktop. It provides a block called <code>time function</code> that takes any reporter (with its inputs filled in), computes the result, but reports <em>how long it took</em> to do the computation.  The answer will be in milliseconds.</li>
                <li>Open the project <tt>U5L3-ReporterTimer</tt> that you saved on page 1 of this lab. Drag in the <tt>U5L3functiontimer</tt> library that you just downloaded.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
		<div class="sidenoteBig">You can replace the <code>list from</code> block with any reporter. You can edit <code>time function</code> to see how it works.</div>

        <p>In this example, it took 27 milliseconds to compute the list of integers from 1 to 1000. (The actual number will depend on how fast your computer is.)</p>

                    Use <code>time function</code> to compare Alphie and Betsy's ways of adding the integers from 1 to <em>n</em>. Try it with several different large numbers to see just how different the algorithms are in terms of the time it takes to compute their outputs.<br />
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">Alphie and Betsy’s algorithms solve the same problem but are quite different in efficiency. Imagine the difference when adding the integers from 1 to 1,000,000&hellip;</div>

                <div class="takeNote">The efficiency of an algorithm can make a huge difference. Sometimes, an efficient algorithm is necessary to solve larger instances of a problem.</div>
                <li>
                    In <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/2-improving-search.html">Lab 1</a> you built two reporters that output the position of an element in a list. The reporter <code>position of __ in unsorted list</code> works for any list as a <em>linear search</em>, checking element-by-element until it finds a match (or gets to the end and reports &quot;Not In List&quot;). The reporter <code>position of __ in sorted list</code> works on sorted lists as a <em>binary search</em> algorithm. So, both will work on sorted lists. Compare them for some long sorted lists and make a table of your findings.	 You may have to use very large lists, say 1000 or 2000 items, to get meaningful results.

                    Throughout this course, you’ve programmed many algorithms. Try timing them! Test your favorite algorithms, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating a list of numbers</li>
                        <li>Testing a list to see if the elements are distinct</li>
                        <li>Adding 1 to a number</li>
                        <li>Computing the factorial of a number</li>
                        <li>Number guessing games</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Time your algorithms for varying size inputs and describe the different behaviors you see. Again, use large inputs for meaningful results.</p>
                </li>
