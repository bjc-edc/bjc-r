            <li>Drones! The key point in this whole topic is that the ability to conduct war from home eliminates the human cost (i.e., dead Americans), which is what voters care about, and therefore make it much easier for a president to choose to go to war overseas without worrying about political consequences. This is really different from previous weapons technologies.<ul><li>We can't say that "dead Americans...is what voters care about." Not only is that cynical, but it's also not true. Plenty of voters care about hurting people of any nationality and would prefer to resolve conflicts without war. --MF

                    <li>Sorry, Mary, but it's neither cynical nor untrue. If it would make you happier, we could say &quot;most voters.&quot; But, for example, never mind the Republicans, all the Democrats who prefer Clinton over Sanders are people who don't care <em>enough</em> about non-American lives to think that being a super hawk should disqualify a candidate for president. Sure, many people say they love peace in the abstract, but there's a ton of research about this, and nobody gets voted out of office for warmaking unless American lives are lost. That's what all the &quot;boots on the ground&quot; nonsense is about! And we <em>have</em> to say so, because people  (at least people who do care about peace) <em>need to know</em> that this is a crucial way in which drones change warfare. They make it cost-free for politicians. --bh</li>

            	<li>When you were listing military technologies, did you think of cryptography? GPS?
                
              Those technologies have other uses too, but they're of definite military importance, and were developed mainly for military use. Cryptography is older than computers, but modern cryptography depends on computers, and some of the earliest computers were developed for that purpose. What other computer-based military technology can you think of?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    <p>On this page we're going to focus on three really important computer-based military technologies.
        <h3>1.  Malware</h3>
        <p>You learned about malware in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-cybersecurity/5-cybersecurity.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 4, Lab 6</a> on Internet security. This is a general name for all kinds of programs intended to do harm, including viruses (which copy themselves like real viruses), DNS spoofing, phishing, and denial of service software.</p>
        <p>Malware is generally used either just to make trouble or to steal money. But various countries' military groups are actively developing malware to disrupt an enemy country's communications or technology centers.</p>
    <div class="forYouToDo">
      <ol start="2">
       <li>Look up &quot;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Stuxnet" target="_blank">Stuxnet</a>,&quot; which is the best-known military malware attack. You can also research other <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=military+malware" target="_blank">military malware</a>.</li>
      </ol></div>
    <h3>2. Autonomous weapons</h3>
    <p>An <strong>autonomous</strong> weapon is one that can decide to fire itself without human decision-making.</p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<p>You can see why the military might want autonomous weapons.</p>
<ol start="3"><li>Look up the amount of time between the detection of a missile attack on the US and the actual explosion of the incoming missiles.</li></ol></div>
<p>On the other hand, autonomous weapons raise the possibility that a programming error could start a nuclear war <em>by accident.</em>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="4">
<li>Look up "nuclear near misses" to read some of the stories about automated false alarms caused by a <a href="http://atomictoasters.com/2012/08/tactical-geese/" target="_blank">flight of geese</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volk_Field_Air_National_Guard_Base#False_alarm_incident" target="_blank">bear</a>, and <a href="http://nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/accidents/20-mishaps-maybe-caused-nuclear-war.htm" target="_blank">many others</a>.</li></ol></div>
<p>In all of these cases, what prevented the outbreak of World War III is that some human expert didn't trust the automatic missile detectors and, sometimes in violation of direct orders, refused to attack the other side.
<p>In 1983, then-President Ronald Reagan announced a program called the &quot;Strategic Defense Initiative&quot; (SDI) that would have placed military satellites in orbit, equipped with both missile detectors and anti-missile weapons, including high-energy lasers. The satellites would be equipped with computers that would detect an enemy attack, aim its weapons at incoming missiles, and destroy them. The project became known by the (sarcastic) nickname &quot;Star Wars.&quot;
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="5">
<li>Look up SDI, and some of the controversies surrounding it, both in 1983 and in later revivals of the idea.</li>
<li>Look up the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which SDI would have violated.  Why would a treaty limit <em>defensive</em> weapons rather than <em>offensive</em> ones?</li>
<li>For a more recent perspective, read this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/01/25/if-killer-robots-arrive-the-terminator-will-be-the-least-of-our-problems/" target="_blank">article about killer robots</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>3. Drones</h3>
<p><strong>Drones</strong> are remotely piloted aircraft. They vary in size from toys for hobbyists to bombers used in warfare. The remote control depends on computers both in the airplane and on the ground.</p>
<div class="takeNote">
<p>"Many contend that President Bush's re-election and increased vote share prove that the Iraq War
was either irrelevant or even an asset to him.
We present evidence to
the contrary. Focusing on
the change in Bush’s 2004 showing compared to
2000, we discover that Iraq War casualties from
a state significantly depressed the President’s vote
share there. We infer that were it not for the
approximately 10,000 U.S. dead and wounded in Iraq by Election Day, Bush would have won
nearly 2% more of the popular vote, carrying
several additional states
and winning decisively... In contrast, National Guard/Reservist call-ups had no significant
additional effect beyond the main casualty effect."

</div>
<p>For an elected president, there are political benefits and political costs to starting a war. A benefit is that when a war starts, especially if voters feel that their country is under attack, a war makes people feel patriotic, and that is reflected in greater approval of the president. That's the primary effect until American soldiers die. Voters disapprove of American deaths. In the study quoted above, the researchers examined George W. Bush's approval ratings <em>state by state,</em> and found that his rating was measurably lower in states from which more soldiers had died.
<p>The risk of American deaths, leading to votes against the president's party, is what keeps presidents from fighting unnecessary wars. It's also why Barack Obama promised &quot;no American boots on the ground&quot; in the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
<p>Drone aircraft are important mainly because they make it easier to start a war in which no Americans die.  The pilots are in the US, not in the country being bombed. It's not that the drones are faster or more accurate or otherwise better from a strictly military viewpoint; it's that they're <em>politically</em> valuable, making it easier to start a war.
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="8">
<li>Discuss: Is making it easier for the US to start a war good or bad?  Come up with some arguments on <em>both sides</em> before deciding on your answer.</li>
<li>Discuss: &quot;The US are the good guys, so we won't start a war unless it's in a good cause.&quot;  This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States" target="_blank">list of US wars</a> may help.</li></ol></div>
