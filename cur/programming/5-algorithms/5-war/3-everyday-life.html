                	Professional codes of ethics all say you shouldn't build technology that's harmful. Is it justifiable to work for the military, or for a military contractor?

				<p>Mary Golda Ross (1908–2008) was a ground-breaking Native American engineer and the first female employed by Lockheed, an American aerospace technology corporation. Ross was passionate about educating women and Native Americans and spent over ten years teaching while earning her Master’s degree in mathematics during the summer.  Lockheed hired her as a mathematician in 1942.  During her thirty-plus years there, Ross contributed to cutting-edge aerospace designs including concepts for interplanetary space travel, crewed and uncrewed Earth-orbiting flights, and orbiting satellites.</p>

An essential aim of computing professionals is to minimize negative consequences of computing systems, including threats to health and safety.

This principle prohibits use of computing technology in ways that result in harm to any of the following: users, the general public, employees, employers. Harmful actions include intentional destruction or modification of files and programs leading to serious loss of resources or unnecessary expenditure of human resources such as the time and effort required to purge systems of "computer viruses." ...</p>
