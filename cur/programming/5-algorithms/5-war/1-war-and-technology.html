                <li>Explain: "War is all about technology" - in what ways is war related to technology? 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who wins a war is largely determined by technology, more than by the size of armies, etc. Students may know the example of the importance of metal-clad warships in the Civil War.

                                <li>New technology changes the rules. For a long time you could make a clear distinction between soldiers and civilians, and just do battle with soldiers. But the ability to drop bombs from airplanes undid that.</li>

<p>SuperSoaker inventor Lonnie Johnson is a career engineer whose professional activities are mostly in energy production, especially solid-state batteries and solar panels.  His earliest professional work was in the U.S. Air Force, and then at Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the Galileo mission to Jupiter.</p>

		<p>Technology affects real wars, too.  The outcome of individual battles may be decided by numbers of soldiers, the strategies of generals, and other human factors.  But, with rare exceptions, if one side has better technology, they win in the long run.  For example, in the Seventh Century, the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire was militarily weak until its invention of &quot;Greek fire,&quot; a flammable chemical that was fired through hoses or in projectiles, with the special property that it would keep burning in water, so it was valuable in naval battles. This weapon was very important to the survival of the empire, which lasted until the 15th Century.</p>
