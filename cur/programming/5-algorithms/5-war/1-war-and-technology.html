                <li><strong>EK 7.4.1A</strong> The innovation and impact of social media and online access varies in different countries and in different socioeconomic groups.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 7.4.1C</strong> The global distribution of computing resources raises issues of equity, access, and power.</li>

I don't know if these are the /original/ sources of the pictures; they're just the places Google Images sent me to.  I can imagine that #2 might be problematic because it's a picture of specific, named kids (not named in the picture, but on that web page).  Does EDC have a copyright clearance department?

<p>SuperSoaker inventor Lonnie Johnson is a career engineer whose professional activities are mostly in energy production, especially solid-state batteries and solar panels.  His earliest professional work was in the U.S. Air Force, and then at Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the Galileo mission to Jupiter.</p>

		<p>Technology affects real wars, too.  The outcome of individual battles may be decided by numbers of soldiers, the strategies of generals, and other human factors.  But, with rare exceptions, if one side has better technology, they win in the long run.  For example, in the Seventh Century, the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire was militarily weak until its invention of &quot;Greek fire,&quot; a flammable chemical that was fired through hoses or in projectiles, with the special property that it would keep burning in water, so it was valuable in naval battles. This weapon was very important to the survival of the empire, which lasted until the 15th Century.</p>
