        <div class="todo">
            <p>PG: Light changes. My experience with "explain" questions like #5 is that they tend to be "guess what I'm thinking" questions. A student who writes "there are more ways to win" is completely right, but the explanation won't clarify (convince) for a person who doesn't see why. A kid who says "Because people who go there win more" is also right....</p>
            <p>MF: Project still needs to be wrapped up and updated online</p>

            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll make the computer play against the human player.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The game currently allows two human players to take turns playing. But you don't really need a computer to keep track of moves for two human players. We want the human player to take turns with a computer player that will move automatically. To simplify the project, we'll assume that the human player will always move first (playing X) and that the computer is playing O.</p>
        <p>For now, you'll create a computer player that moves to <em>random</em> positions on the board. (It won't be a very good player, but you'll fix that once the structure of the code for the computer's move is in place.) Once the program decides where it wants to move, you'll use <code>broadcast</code> to send a message to tell the clone with the matching <var>position number</var> to record a move. (For the human player, <code>when I am clicked</code> serves this purpose, but the computer's moves aren't prompted by the user clicking a square.)</p>
        <div class="endnote">Recall that clones are temporary copies of a sprite. You learned about them in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-abstraction/5-building-tic-tac-toe.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment#clones" title="Unit 3 Lab 1 Page 5: Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board">Unit 3 Lab 1 Page 5: Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board</a>.</div>
        <div class="takeNote">
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/broadcast.png" alt="broadcast" title="broadcast" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-i-receive.png" alt="when I receive" title="when I receive" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/message.png" alt="message" title="message" /><br />
            <p><code>Broadcast</code> sends out a message to all the sprites in the project. Any scripts that start with <code>when I receive</code> and have a matching message in the input slot will run.</p>
            <p>The <code>message</code> reporter reports the most recent message sent out.</p>
        </div>
        
		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
                <li>If it isn't open already, open your U5-TicTacToe project.</li>
		<li>Find the script that starts <code>when I am clicked</code>.  That script handles a move by the human player.  Now start a new script next to it:<br />
		<img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/when-receive.png" alt="when I receive (any message) : if (message) = (square number) [nothing in script slot yet]" title="when I receive (any message) : if (message) = (square number) [nothing in script slot yet]" />
		</li>
		<li>What's going to go in that slot?  What it needs to do is make a move on behalf of the computer.  But that's just like making a move on behalf of a human player, except that a different event makes it happen.  So you're going to be tempted to copy and paste all the code from the "clicked" script to the "receive" script, but don't do that.  Instead, make a block
		<img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/move-here.png" alt="move in this square (command block)" title="move in this square (command block)" /> and drag everything inside the <code>if</code> that surrounds the move-here code into the new block.  So you now have (depending on exactly how you wrote the "clicked" script) <br />
		<img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/when-receive.png" alt="move in this square (command block)" title="move in this square (command block)" />
		</li>
               <li>After your code for Player X's turn, use <code>broadcast</code> with a random number from 1 to 9 as the message. (The computer will move in the corresponding square, once you've written the code to handle the message.)</li>
                <div class="sidenoteBig">
                	<a href="#hint-when-i-receive" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click here for a hint about the <code>when I am clicked</code> script.">Click here for a hint about the <code>when I receive</code> script.</a>
					<div id="hint-when-i-receive" class="collapse"><img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/when-i-am-clicked-script.png" alt="when I receive (any message) {if (position number = message) {} }" title="when I receive (any message) {if (position number = message) {} }"></div>
                </div>
				<li>Then create a <code>when I receive</code> script that will accept <var>any message</var> as input. If the <var>position number</var> for the clone matches the <code>message</code>, make the computer move in the correct clone's space and check for a win or a tie.</li>
                <div class="takeNote">Instead of copying code from <code>when I am clicked</code> to <code>when I receive</code>, move that code into a custom block and call the custom block from both scripts. This is one of the ways to use <em>abstraction</em> in programming: don't have two copies of the same piece of code; instead, give it a name.</div>
				<div class="narrower">If your computer player uses the wrong costume when it plays in the last square, it's because the parent sprite has the same <var>position number</var>. Revise <code>make board</code>, and ensure that the parent's position number isn't 1-9 so that it doesn't conflict with a clone.</div>
				<li>Take turns with your partner playing Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer. Fix any bugs you find.</li>
                <div class="todo">In the first move of the first time I tried this today, the computer played in the same space as I had just played, so I fixed that (knowing, as the curriculum designer that I don't really have to because of what comes next, but because the student won't know what's next), but then I noticed that when X wins, which it generally will against a random player, O then moves again--potentially even "winning" after me. So I tried to fix that, and after trying for a bit, I ended up deciding to stop and write about this potential time sink rather than sinking my own time into it. What to do? --MF, 9/6/18
                    <p>Also: we have no note about removing the Player O code, which we might consider adding, and the orange box in #3 is too late; I'd already done copy and paste before I saw it. Our directions really inspire "just doing what it says without thinking" I'm not sure what to do about that... (BTW, should we have said that earlier? I can't find a good place because we build up the code slowly, but I wondered it.) --MF, 9/6/18</p></div>
			</ol>

		<p>Instead of having the computer move at random, you will start to give the computer some strategy. Unlike people, all squares on the tic-tac-toe board are <em>not</em> created equal. Playing in the center (position 5) or on a corner (positions 1, 3, 7, or 9) is better than playing on an edge (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8).<br />
