        <div class="todo">

            <p><strong>In this lab</strong>, you'll extend your <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/3-tic-tac-toe/1-find-ties.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Tic-Tac-Toe program">Tic-Tac-Toe program</a> to make the computer play against you.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll review the blocks in your previous Tic-Tac-Toe project.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Open your <strong>U3L3-TicTacToe</strong> project, and save it as <strong>U5L6-TicTacToe</strong> so you'll still have your old version as a backup.</li>
                <li>
                    Play part of a game, stop before finishing, and then click on each of the following blocks. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Discuss what each expression does and how its code works.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/board.png" alt="board" title="board" /></li>
            	        <div class="sidenote">You can edit a block to remind yourself of how it works if you've forgotten.</div>
                        <li><img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/possible-winning-triples.png" alt="possible winning triples" title="possible winning triples"></li>
                        <li><img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/status-of-all-winning-triples.png" alt="status of all winning triples" title="status of all winning triples"></li>

                    Two of these blocks report what's on the board but in different ways: <code>status of all winning triples</code> and <code>board</code>. Why do you need both of those? When do you use each of them?
                </li>
		<li>What tells the program that clicking in a square means to move in that square?  How does it know which square you clicked?</li>
            </ol>
