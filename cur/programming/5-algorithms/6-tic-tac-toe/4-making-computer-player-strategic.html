        <h2>Making the Computer Play Strategically</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>MF: Project still needs to be wrapped up and updated online</p>
        </div>

        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll implement the Tic-Tac-Toe strategy rules to make the computer play strategically.</p>
        </div>

        <p>You'll set up a <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/next-move.png" alt="next move for computer" title="next move for computer"> block so you can broadcast to all the clones the position where the computer will move. As before, only the clone with the matching <var>position number</var> will make the move.</p>
        <p>
        	The code for <code>next move for computer</code> will implement the three strategy rules:
            <ul>
                <li>Rule 1: If I (the computer, player O) can win, do so.</li>
                <li>Rule 2: If my opponent (the human, player X) can win, block them.</li>
                <li>Final rule: Otherwise, just pick the best empty square.</li>
            </ul>
		</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
				<li>If it isn't open already, open your U5L6-TicTacToe project.</li>
                <li>
		  The English description of Rules 1 and 2 is "If ... do ..."  To turn that into code using the <code>if</code> block, you'll need a predicate to put in the hexagonal input slot of <code>if</code>.  Write
<img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/can-player-win-now.png" alt="can player () win now?" title="can player () win now?" /> using the
<img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/winning-square-for-player.png" alt="winning square for player" title="winning square for player" /> block you wrote on the previous page.
		</li>
               <li>Now, create the <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/next-move.png" alt="next move for computer" title="next move for computer"> block that implements the strategy rules using these two new blocks, and use it as the input to <code>broadcast</code> instead of <code>best empty square</code>. </li>

                <li>Play against the computer, and find a strategy that lets you win the game. (This isn't trivial; just the computer rules you already have are pretty good.)</li>
                <li>
                    Program more rules to make the computer a better player.  This will involve looking more than one move ahead.  There are various ways to do it, and what follows is just one suggestion.

                            It's not good enough just to look for a winning move for yourself two moves from now. If you can see such a move, so can your opponent, who'll move to block you. So what you have to find is a <em>fork: </em>two triples in which you have one appearance and your opponent has none, and which have a free square in common. This is much easier to see with a picture:<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/hof/fork.png" alt="board with fork" title="board with fork" /><br />
                            <div class="endnote">Player X opened the game with the standard opening move, in the center. Player O responded poorly, on the top edge, and is therefore about to lose the game. Player X played in the top left corner. Player O had to respond in the bottom right corner in order to block an immediate win for player X. It's player X's turn. There is no winning combination with two Xs, nor with two Os. But player X can find <em>two</em> winning combinations, the ones marked with the red lines, both of which have one X and two free squares, <em>with one of the free squares in common</em>. In the picture, the common square is 4, the left edge square, and so that's where Player X should move.</div>
                        </li>
                        <li>Find all the triples (that is, report a <em>list of triples</em>) in which the computer has one square and the other two are empty, and store them in a variable called <var>singles</var>.</li>
                        <li>
                            Make one big list of all the letters and numbers from the triples:<br />
