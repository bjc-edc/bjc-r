<h2>Why do we use models and simulations?</h2>
<p>
Models and simulations are computer representations of complex phenomena in the real world.  They are used to explain or predict real life occurences.  There are many reasons to use computer simulations rather than real world experiments:</p>
<ul>
<li> Experimenting in the real world may be <strong>expensive</strong>. For example, a new design for an airplane might fall apart in strong winds.  Using a computer to model the shape of the airplane and to simulate the wind behavior can eliminate some bad designs before building a real airplane.</li>
<li>Experimenting in the real world may be <strong>time-consuming</strong> such as testing the effects of a genetic mutation in a species across generations.</li>

<li>Experimenting in the real world may be <strong>dangerous</strong>, such as testing whether a nuclear reactor will survive an earthquake.</li>

<li>Experimenting in the real world may be <strong>unethical</strong>, such as giving a population a disease to test how fast it spreads.</li>
</ul>

<p>Computer models rarely capture the full complexity of real situations.  For example, models that scientist use to predict the impact of global climate change have to account for hundreds of interconnected factors such as wind patterns, the course of rivers, geological fault lines that cause earthquakes, and interactions of local plants and animals.  It would be impossible to include all of these dependencies in a model.  So, researchers have to make <em>simplifying assumptions</em> in their models, based on their past experiences making predictions.</p>

<p>Researchers may use an <em>iterative design process</em>, starting with a very simple model and refining that model to make it more realistic for the next simulation.  Highly detailed models may push the limits of current computer speeds.  So, researchers may have to limit the complexity of the model.  Complex models and simulations depend on abstractions (simplifications) to avoid the many details of the real world phenomena.
