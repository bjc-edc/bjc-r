            Models and simulations are computer representations of complex things in the real world.  They are used to explain or predict the actual behaviors of objects in the real world.  Why use simulations, instead of doing experiments?  There are many reasons; here are a few:
            <ul>
                <li> Doing the experiment in the real world may be very expensive, requiring the construction of, say, an airplane that might fall apart in strong winds.  Modeling the airplane shape and simulating the wind behavior can eliminate some bad designs until reaching a level of confidence that justifies finally building the real airplane.</li>
                <li>Doing the experiment may be very dangerous, such as testing whether a nuclear reactor will survive an earthquake.</li>
                <li>Doing the experiment may be unethical, such as giving people a disease to test whether a new drug will cure them.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>Computer models rarely capture the full complexity of real situations. Think about the models that scientists use to predict the results of global climate change in 10 years, or in 100 years. So many factors affect the weather! Models have to account for geological fault lines that lead to earthquakes, the course of rivers, wind patterns, which plants and animals live in what regions, and much more. So model-builders make simplifying assumptions, based on their experience of which things were most important in past predictions.</p>
        
        <p>Researchers may use an iterative design process, starting with a very simple model, and examining the results of simulations using that model to decide what aspects of the real situation have to be modeled more precisely for the next simulation.  Really detailed models may push the limits of current computer speeds.  That's another reason researchers may have to limit the complexity of the model.  Complex models and simulations generally depend heavily on the idea of levels of abstraction.  World climate is a good example of something that could never be simulated if programmers had to think about the lowest-level details all the time.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">As a class discuss and come up with some examples of complex real life phenomena for which it would be impractical, impossible or even unethical to conduct real world experiments.  Explain how modeling and simulations may help with our understanding of these phenomena.  What are the pros and cons of such an approach?</div>
