        <h2>Flipping a Coin Hints</h2>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            Here are some hints for one possible way to write the code:
            <ol>
                <li>Create variables <code>Heads</code>, <code>Tails</code>, <code>Total</code> to keep track of the number of Heads, Tails and “Total” that have been tossed, and initialize these variables.</li>
                <li>Create a custom block <code>TossCoin</code> that simulates a coin being tossed by rapidly switching between Heads and Tails costumes a few times.</li>
                <li>Ask the user how many times they wish to toss the coin, and check that the value entered by the user is a number.</li>
                <li>If the value entered is a number, repeat the simulation of the coin toss for the number of times entered by the user.</li>
                <li>After each toss, randomly chose between costumes Heads or Tails.</li>
                <li>Increment the associated variables <code>Heads</code>, <code>Tails</code>, and update the value of <code>Total</code>.</li>
                <li>Play a sound that signals the end of a flip.</li>
                <li>Add a brief pause between each toss.</li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            If you need further hints, the following are some blocks already built for you, but put in scrambled order.  Your job at this point is to put the pieces of the puzzle together to build a functional code in Snap! <br />
