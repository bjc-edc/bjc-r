		<h2>Graphing Functions</h2>
        <div class="todo">
        	<ul>
            	<ol>
                	<li>building the function-grapher using the same PlotPoint</li>
                    <li>putting x in your hands</li>
                    <li>rescaling</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The same <code>PlotPoint</code> and <code>set window scale</code> can be used for graphing functions, but you'll need to build a different grapher that doesn't expect a list of points but instead takes a function as input and <em>runs</em> that function with varying values of <em>x</em> to generate the points.  </p>
        <p>You already have a tool that will translate the mouse position on the stage into appropriate <em>x</em> values based on the scale of the screen. So the position of your mouse can represent <em>x</em>. <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/x-value-at-stage-coord-(mouse-x).png" alt="x-value-at-stage-coord-(mouse-x)"></p>
        <p><code>PlotPoint</code> can use that as <em>x</em>, and so can your function. And your function's output is <code>PlotPoint</code>'s <em>y</em>. So all you need is to be able to "call" that function with the right input, and use its value in <code>PlotPoint</code>. <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/call(function)with-inputs(x-value-at-stage-coordinate(mouse-x)).png" alt="call(function)with-inputs(x-value-at-stage-coordinate(mouse-x))"></p>
        <p>You are used to placing reporters (including functions) in input slots, but what you get is the <em>value</em> of the function at that moment, not the function itself, that you can evaluate at many different moments.  To give  <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/Graph-function.png"  alt="Graph-function"> a function as input, you must define it to <em>expect</em> a function as input. </p>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
    <ol> <div class="sidenoteBig">Leave one slot in your function blank to indicate where the value of "x" will go. The block <code>squared</code> shown here is not a Snap! primitive; if you want something like that, you will need to build it yourself.</div>
        <li>Build <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/Graph-function.png"  alt="Graph-function"> and try it out with any function you like, for example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/function-((-5)-plus-(()-plus-(-3))-squared.png"  alt="function-((-5)-plus-(()-plus-(-3))-squared">. </li>
