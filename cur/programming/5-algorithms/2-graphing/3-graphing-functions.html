        The same <code>PlotPoint</code> and <code>set window scale</code> can be used for graphing functions, but you'll need to build a different grapher that doesn't expect a list of points but instead takes a function as input and <em>runs</em> that function with varying values of <em>x</em> to generate the points.  
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
    <ol>
        <li>You already have a tool that will translate the mouse position on the stage into appropriate <em>x</em> values based on the scale of the screen, and you already have a tool that will translate the function's output into an appropriate position on the stage to show that value.  All you need is....</li>
       
    </ol>
