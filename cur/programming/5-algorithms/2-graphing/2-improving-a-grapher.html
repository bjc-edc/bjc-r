    	  <ol>
          	<li>You have another dataset on one classroom of 27 sixth-graders: <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/Gr6-age-height-weight-gender-stats.png" alt="Gr6-age-height-weight-gender-stats">. Each data point in this set contains <em>four</em> items:  age in months, height in centimeters, weight in kilograms, and gender. Your grapher was written to expect only <em>two</em> numbers in each datapoint. Will it even work with this dataset? Try it. What does it do?</li>
            <li>Create a block that reports a list containing only the 27 ages. <p>Create another block that reports only the 27 heights.</p> <p>Create another block that reports only the 27 weights.</p> <p>Create a block that takes any list of numbers as input and reports the <em>average</em> value.</p></li>
            <li>Create a block, using <code>keep</code>, that reports a list containing all the datapoints of only the girls, and another block that does the same for the boys.</li>
            <li>You now have everything you need to create a graph of height against weight, showing the boys and girls in different colors, and also allowing you to examine individual datapoints to see their approximate values. Here's an example of such a graph.</li>
     </ol></div>

         <ol start="5">
            	<li>Use your tools to create a few separate graphs—age against height or weight, height against weight, separated or not separated by gender—and <em>also mark the averages</em> in each case. What can you say about this particular class based on the data?</li>
                <li>You probably needed to reset the window scale for some of these graphs. Searching through the data to find the lowest and highest values can be a nuisance. Create tools to do that for you. </li>
