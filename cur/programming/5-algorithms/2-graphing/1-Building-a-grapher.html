    	<h2>Plotting points</h2>
        
        <p>Plotting a single point, given its two coordinates, should feel this simple.</p>
        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/PlotPoint-simple.png" alt="PlotPoint block using go to x y, pendown, move 1, penup"></p>
        <p>Then you could graph a whole list of data points by inventing a block like <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/GraphDatapoints.png"  alt="Graph datapoints (pointlist)"> that uses <code>PlotPoint</code> for each item of the list.</p>
    	<p>If  all the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) pairs fit on the stage that seems like all you should need, but what if you want to plot the popularity of a baby name over time, like this?</p>
        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/PercentageOfDerekByYear.png"  alt="percentage of births named Derek by year"></p>
    <p>The <em>x</em>-values can't be plotted because they are completely off the screen. And even if you adjusted them to be on the screen <em>y</em>-values 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc., are so close to zero that they would all look the same. We would not see the huge increase in popularity between 1960 and 1980. </p>
        <p>A good grapher needs to let the user set the scale of the screen, to specify where to focus attention, where to zoom in. </p>

           	  <li>Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/U5L2-GrapherStarter.xml">this Snap<em>!</em> project.</a> It contains several blocks already built for your convenience.
                <ol>
                    <li>Click  the <code>set window scale</code> block with the inputs it already has (-2, 4, 30, 300) to see what it does. It sets several variables that your other blocks will need so that they know the intended screen dimensions. It also draws axes (or substitutes) on the screen and labels the place where they cross.</li>

                    <li>Now click <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/set-window-scale-xmin-(1927)-xmax-(2014)-ymin-(0)-ymax-(0.5).png"  alt="set-window-scale-xmin-(1927)-xmax-(2014)-ymin-(0)-ymax-(0.5)"> to reset the size of the screen.</li>

      </li>
           	  
              <li>Experiment with various inputs to see where it puts the axes and how it represents the &quot;substitutes&quot; for the axes, when the axes can't be shown.</li>
              <li>Build <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/go-to-scaled-point-x-y.png" alt="go to scaled point">. The two operations that convert data coordinates into stage coordinates, so that <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/go-to-scaled-point-x(1971)-y(0.25).png" alt="go-to-scaled-point-x(1971)-y(0.25)">
sets the sprite  in roughly the middle of the stage.</li>
           	  <li>Then, build <code>PlotPoint</code> so that it uses the new <code>go to scaled point</code> instead of plain <code>go to</code>.</li>
              <li>inally build <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/GraphDatapoints.png"  alt="Graph Datapoints (list input)"> and try it out.</li>
