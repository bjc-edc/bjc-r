           	  <li>Plotting a point, given its two coordinates, should feel this simple.

                That would seem fine if all the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) pairs fit on the stage. <img src="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/Graph-datapoints().png"  alt="Graph Datapoints (list input)">

       	<li>What strategy gives you the best you can do? Describe your strategy clearly and precisely enough for your pair programmer to use it in playing the game.</li>
        <li>With your partner, build a program that uses your strategy to guess someone's secret number. If your secret number is 21, the program should work something like this:
