    	<h2>Plotting points</h2>
        
        <p>Plotting a point, given its two coordinates, should feel this simple.</p>
        <p><img src="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/PlotPoint-simple.png" alt="PlotPoint block using go to x y, pendown, move 1, penup"></p>
        
    <p>That would seem fine if all the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) pairs fit on the stage.</p>
    <p>Then the graphing could be done 
    by giving a list of data points like <img src="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/list-of-points(4,7),(-3,5.1),(1.5)(2.05).png"  alt="list of arbitrary points"> to a block like  <img src="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/Graph-datapoints().png"  alt="Graph datapoints (pointlist)"> that applies <code>PlotPoint</code> to each item of the list.</p>
    <p>But what if you wanted to plot the popularity of a baby name over time, like this?</p>
        <p><img src="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/PercentageOfDerekByYear.png"  alt="percentage of births named Derek by year"></p>
    <p>The <em>y</em>-values 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc., are so close to zero that they would all look the same. We would not see the huge increase in popularityâ€”the name 8 times as popular in 1980 as in 1960. In fact, we wouldn't even see those points because the <em>x</em>-values are off the screen.</p>
        <p>A grapher needs to be able to specify the scale of the screen. </p>

    <ol>
           	  <li>Build a block like this to set global variables that your other procedures can use.
              <p><img src="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/set-window-scale-xmin-(1927)-xmax-(2014)-ymin-(0)-ymax-(0.5).png"  alt="set-window-scale-xmin-(1927)-xmax-(2014)-ymin-(0)-ymax-(0.5)"></p>
              </li>
           	  <li>Build <img src="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/go-to-scaled-point-x-y.png" alt="go to scaled point">
        and the two operations that convert data coordinates into stage coordinates, so that <img src="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/go-to-scaled-point-x(1971)-y(0.25).png" alt="go-to-scaled-point-x(1971)-y(0.25)">
        sets the sprite  in roughly the middle of the stage.</li>
           	  <li>Then, build <code>PlotPoint</code> so that it uses the new <code>go to scaled</code> instead of plain <code>go to</code>, and finally build <img src="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/Graph-datapoints().png"  alt="Graph Datapoints (list input)">.
