        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will consider a problem that <em>can't</em> have an answer.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>By this point in the course, you've experienced the frustration of debugging a program. It would be great if there were a general-purpose debugging program that could read any code and determine if there were bugs. Unfortunately, we can use proof by contradiction (as Alphie, Betsy, and Gamal did on the previous page) to prove that this can't be done.</p>
        <div class="vocabBig">
            <p>An <strong>infinite loop</strong> is a sequence of computer instructions that repeats forever.</p>
            <p>An <strong>undecidable problem</strong> is one for which no algorithm can ever be written that will always give a correct true/false answer for every input value.</p> 
        </div>
        <p>First, we'll assume that it's possible to write a function to determine if there are <em>infinite loops</em> in a program (situations in which a function runs forever without reporting a value). Then, we'll use that function in a program especially designed to create a contradiction (a logical incompatibility) to prove that the assumption is wrong&mdash;<strong>no general-purpose debugging program program can exist</strong>. "Does this program have bugs" is an <em>undecidable problem</em>; no algorithm can ever be constructed that always solves it correctly for every program.</p>
		
        
        <h3>Assuming That a <code>Halts?</code> Function Exists</h3>
        <h4><strong>Making the Assumption</strong></h4>
        <p>
			<div class="sidenote">We can't show the code inside <code>halts?</code>; we are proving that it can't be written at all, no matter what code implements it.</div>
            First, we <em>assume</em> there exists a function called <code>halts?</code> that determines whether a given reporter will report a value in a finite time. (If so, we say that the reporter <em>halts.</em>) It takes two inputs: a function and an input value for that function. It reports <code>true</code> if the function would report a value when given that input;  it reports <code>false</code> if the function would run forever (in an infinite loop).<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts.png" alt="halts? (function) (input)" title="halts? (function) (input)" />
        </p>
        
        <p>For example, the function <code>round</code> will not run forever when given the input <var>7.5</var>; it will report 8.</p>
        <div class="sidenote">The gray ring around the input function means that the <code>halts?</code> code will treat the input function as data instead of running it. </div>
        <p class="indent"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts-reporting.png" alt="halts?(round())(7.5) reporting true" title="halts?(round())(7.5) reporting true" /> because <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/round(7-5).png" alt="round (7.5)" title="round (7.5)" /> reports a value.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, imagine we had a function that will get stuck in an infinite loop when given the input <var>foo</var>; it would never report (never halt).</p>
        <p class="indent"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts-reporting-false.png" alt="halts?(program with an infinite loop ())(foo) reporting false" title="halts?(program with an infinite loop ())(foo) reporting false" /> because <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/program-with-loop(foo).png" alt="program with an infinite loop (foo)" title="program with an infinite loop (foo)" /> loops infinitely.</p>
        
        
        <h4><strong>Reviewing the Plan for the Proof</strong></h4>
        <p>We'll use proof by contradiction to show that the following question <em>can't</em> be answered <em>in general</em>:</p>
        <p class="center"><strong>Will a certain computer program, given a certain input, report a result in a finite amount of time?</strong></p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p>The "computer program" is the first input to <code>halts?</code>. The "given input" is the second input to <code>halts?</code>. And what <code>halts?</code> reports is either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>: yes the "computer program" will halt or no it won't.</p>
            <p>Note that <code>halts?</code> itself must always report a result, even if the program it's testing doesn't. This is because we are <em>assuming</em> that <code>halts?</code> always works&mdash;that it always reports an answer.</p>
        </div>
		<p>We <em>can</em> answer this question for some <em>specific</em> functions, but we are trying to determine whether we can devise a <em>general</em> test that will tell us whether <em>any</em> particular function will report a value for <em>any</em> specific input.</p>
        
        <div class="endnote">
			<a href="#hint-general" data-toggle="collapse" title="What specific functions?">What does it mean to answer the question for <em>specific</em> functions?</a>
            <div id="hint-general" class="collapse">
                <p>
                    The "in general" part is important. Of course we can answer the question for certain particular programs. This one halts (reports a value) for <em>any</em> input:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/three-fn.png" alt="three(x): report (3)" title="three(x): report (3)" /> 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    This one <em>never</em> halts for any input:<br />

                </p>
                <p>
                    And this one halts <em>sometimes</em>&mdash;for any input except 87:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/weird-fn.png" width="158" alt="weird(x): if (x = 87) (forever (wait 1 secs)) else (report (3))" title="weird(x): if (x = 87) (forever (wait 1 secs)) else (report (3))" /> 
                </p>
                <p>Recall: the question is whether we can devise a test that will tell us whether <em>any</em> particular function will report a value for <em>any</em> specific input.</p>

        <h3>Showing How This Creates a Contradiction</h3>
        
		<h4><strong>Constructing a Program For Which <code>Halts?</code> Won't Work</strong></h4>
		<p>
            To prove there can be no such function, we need to create a contradiction. We need to show that there has to be at least one function and one input to that function for which <code>halts?</code> fails to work the way we assumed it does. So, we can make up a block, <code>tester</code>, specifically for the purpose of breaking <code>halts?</code>:<br />
            <div class="sidenoteBig">
                Just like the <code>#</code> and <code>⋮</code> symbols for inputs declared to be <em>numbers</em> or <em>lists</em>, the <code>&lambda;</code> is not part of the input's name but is a <strong>type hint</strong> that was created when selecting the <em>reporter</em> input type:<br />  
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/input-type-reporter.png" alt="selecting the Reporter input type" title="selecting the Reporter input type"/><br />
                Recall that selecting an input type changes the appearance of the input slot so that it indicates what kind of input is expected. The input slot for <code>tester</code> will have a rounded gray ring to indicate that the input should be a reporter: <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/tester().png" alt="tester ()" title="tester ()" />
            </div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/tester-halting.png" alt="tester(reporter){if(halts?(reporter)(reporter){forever{}}else{report(It doesn't matter what value is reported.)}}" title="tester(reporter){if(halts?(reporter)(reporter){forever{}}else{report(It doesn't matter what value is reported.)}}">
        </p>
        <p>The <code>forever</code> block in this script creates an infinite loop. If the <code>tester</code> code ends up in this part of the <code>if</code> statement, it will never report anything. So whether <code>tester</code> <em>itself</em> will halt depends on the output of the <code>halts?</code> predicate in the <code>if</code> statement inside it.</p>
        <p>The expression <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts-reporter-reporter.png" alt="halts? (reporter) (reporter)" title="halts? (reporter) (reporter)" /> asks what will happen if we call the inputted function (<var>reporter</var>) with <em>itself</em> as its own input. This is similar to when Betsy made a statement about the statement she was making, when she said, "The statement I'm making <em>right now</em> is false."</p>
        
        <div class="endnote">
            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
            This <em>is</em> challenging. Stick with it! We are <em>creating a contradiction</em> to prove that the <code>halts?</code> function called inside <code>tester</code> can't exist. 
        </div>
        
        <h4><strong>Using Self-Reference to Lead to Contradiction</strong></h4>
        <p>
            To make the situation <em>exactly</em> like what Betsy said ("The statement I'm making <em>right now </em>is false."), we'll call <code>tester</code> on <em>itself</em>:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/testertester.png" alt="tester(tester())" title="tester(tester())" /><br />
            Now, the <code>if</code> statement inside the <code>tester</code> block will ask if <code>tester</code> will halt (not run forever) if it's called with <code>tester</code> as its input. The predicate in the <code>if</code> statement will become <code>halts? (tester) (tester)</code>.<br />
<div class="todo">I took out class="indent" on this picture so that it'd fit in the window.  If you don't like that, figure out how to shrink the picture without fuzzing it up. -bh<br />OK, leaving this comment here to remind me for another day. --MF, 2/1/18</div>
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/tt-t-htt.png" alt="tester(tester) -&gt; reporter input in tester definition -&gt; halts? (tester) (tester)" title="tester(tester) -&gt; reporter input in tester definition -&gt; halts? (tester) (tester)">
        </p>
        <p>So, just as in the examples above,</p>
        <p class="indent"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts-tester-tester-reporting-true.png" alt="halts (tester) (tester) reporting true" title="halts (tester) (tester) reporting true" /> would mean that <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/testertester.png" alt="tester(tester())" title="tester(tester())" /> returns a value.</p>
        <p class="indent"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts-tester-tester-reporting-false.png" alt="halts (tester) (tester) reporting false" title="halts (tester) (tester) reporting false" /> would mean that <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/testertester.png" alt="tester(tester())" title="tester(tester())" /> loops infinitely.</p>
                
        <h4><strong>Understanding the Contradiction</strong></h4>
        <p>
        	When we call <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/testertester.png" alt="tester(tester())" title="tester(tester())" />, we run into the contradiction. To see how, look back at the <code>tester</code> definition:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/tester-halting.png" alt="tester(reporter){if(halts?(reporter)(reporter){forever{}}else{report(true)}}" title="tester(reporter){if(halts?(reporter)(reporter){forever{}}else{report(true)}}">
        </p>
        <p>
            Showing that <strong>the result has to be wrong</strong> involves a <em>case analysis</em> like the ones used to solve the logic puzzles on page 1. Consider the two possible cases:
            <ol>
              <li>If <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts-tester-tester-reporting-true.png" alt="halts (tester) (tester) reports true" title="halts (tester) (tester) reports true" /> then <code>tester</code> will take the first branch of the <code>if</code>, and so it will loop forever. That means <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/testertester.png" alt="tester(tester())" title="tester(tester())" /> <em>won't</em> halt, and so <code>halts?</code> gave the wrong answer.</li>
                <li>If <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts-tester-tester-reporting-false.png" alt="halts (tester) (tester) reports false" title="halts (tester) (tester) reports false" /> then <code>tester</code> will take the <code>else</code> branch and report "It doesn't matter what value is reported." That means <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/testertester.png" alt="tester(tester())" title="tester(tester())" /> <em>will</em> halt, and so <code>halts?</code> is wrong again.</li>
            </ol>
		</p>
        <div class="endnote">It doesn't matter <em>what</em> value <code>tester</code> reports, just that it reports <em>some</em> value, but it <em>does</em> matter what value <code>halts?</code> reports.</div>
        
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p>No matter what <code>halts?</code> reports, it will always disagree with itself in a program like this. <strong>This contradiction (this logical impossibility) means that the assumption that it's possible write <code>halts?</code> has to be wrong</strong>. This isn't just a claim about what will happen in Snap<em>!</em>. The language you use to explore a computational problem can impact the clarity or readability of your code but not whether a solution to a problem exists. Even with advances in quantum computing, we will never be able to create a general-purpose debugging program. This famous example is known as the <em>halting problem,</em> and the fact that the halting problem is not decidable is the <em>Halting Theorem.</em></p>

            <h4><strong>Who first proved the Halting Theorem?</strong></h4>
            <p>Alan Turing (1912-1954) was one of the founders of computer science. He is known for two achievements. First, he made a massive contribution to winning World War II by inventing a mathematical theory and corresponding computer hardware to break the encoded messages generated by the German Enigma machine. Second, together with his colleague Alonzo Church, Turing was a founder of <em>theoretical computer science</em>: proving how computers <em>must</em> work regardless of future technology. Though his work on the Halting Problem, he proved that <em>there are computations that can never be done</em>, no matter how big and fast computers get.</p>
            <p>When Turing did this work, there were no programmable computers; people had to rewire physical machines to solve each new problem. With powerful programming languages (such as Snap<em>!</em>), we can see and understand the essence of Turing's proof much more easily because we can use functions as inputs to other functions, as you've seen with <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>. This proof was even harder for Turing because he had to invent the idea of a computer program that can itself be represented as data inside the computer.</p>
