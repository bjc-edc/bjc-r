        Selim suggested EK's: <br />

        4.2.3C An undecidable problem is one in which no algorithm can be constructed that always leads to a correct yes or no answer. <br /><br />

        4.2.3A An undecidable problem may have instances that have an algorithmic solution, but there is not algorithmic solution that solves all instances of the problem.<br />
		4.2.3B A decidable problem is one in which an algorithm can be constructed to answer "yes" or "no" for all inputs (e.g., "is the number even?").<br />

		<p>By this point in the course, you've experienced the frustration of debugging a program. It would be great if there were a general-purpose debugging program that could read any code and determine if there were bugs. Unfortunately, we can use proof by contradiction (like Alphie, Betsy, and Gamal did on the previous page) to prove that this can't be done.</p>
        <p>First, we'll assume that it's possible to write a function to determine if there are <em>infinite loops</em> in a program (situations in which a function runs forever without reporting a value). Then, we'll use that function in a program especially designed to create a contradiction (a logical incompatibility) to prove that the assumption is wrong&mdash;<strong>no general-purpose debugging program program can exist</strong>. "Does this program have bugs" is an <em>undecidable problem</em>; no algorithm can ever be constructed that always solves it correctly for every program.</p>

            <div class="sidenote">The code inside <code>halts?</code> is not important in order for us to <em>assume</em> that it can be written; we are proving that it can't be written the way we want it to work anyway.</div>
            First, we <em>assume</em> there exists a function called <code>halts?</code> that determines whether a reporter will report a value. It takes two inputs: a function and an input value for that function. It reports <code>true</code> if the function would report a value when given that input (and so it would halt), and it reports <code>false</code> if the function would run forever (in an infinite loop).<br />

        </p>
        
        <p>For example, the function <code>round</code> will not run forever when given the input <var>7.5</var>; it will report 8.</p>

        <p>As another example, imagine we had a function that will get stuck in an infinite loop when given the input <var>foo</var>; it would never report (never halt).</p>
        <p class="indent"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts-reporting-false.png" alt="halts?(program with an infinite loop ())(foo) reporting false" title="halts?(program with an infinite loop ())(foo) reporting false" /> because <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/program-with-loop(foo).png" alt="program with an infinite loop (foo)" title="program with an infinite loop (foo)" /> loops indefinitely.</p>

            We use proof by contradiction to show that the following question <em>can't</em> be answered <em>in general</em>: <strong>Will a certain computer program, given a certain input, report a result in a finite amount of time?</strong>

                        The "in general" part is important. Of course we can answer the question for certain particular programs. This one halts (reports a value) for any input:<br />

		<h3>Showing How This Creates a Contradiction</h3>
        
        <h4><strong>Constructing a Program Where <code>Halts?</code> Won't Work</strong></h4>
        <p>
            To prove there can be no such function, we need to create a contradiction. We need to show that there has to be at least one function and one input to that function for which <code>halts?</code> fails to work the way we assumed it does. So, we can make up a block, <code>tester</code>, specifically for this purpose:<br />
            <div class="sidenoteBig">
                Just like the <code>#</code> and <code>â‹®</code> symbols for inputs declared to be <em>numbers</em> or <em>lists</em>, the <code>&lambda;</code> is not part of the input's name but is a <strong>type hint</strong> that was created when selecting the <em>reporter</em> input type:<br />  
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/input-type-reporter.png" alt="selecting the Reporter input type" title="selecting the Reporter input type"/><br />
                Recall that a type hint changes the appearance of the input slot so that it indicates what kind of input is expected. The input slot for <code>tester</code> will have a rounded gray ring to indicate that the input should be a reporter: <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/tester().png" alt="tester ()" title="tester ()" />
            </div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/tester-halting.png" alt="tester(function){if(halts?(function)(function){forever{}}else{report(true)}}" title="tester(function){if(halts?(function)(function){forever{}}else{report(true)}}">
        </p>
        <p>The <code>forever</code> block in this script creates an infinite loop. If the <code>tester</code> code ends up in this part of the <code>if</code> statement, it will never report anything. So whether <code>tester</code> <em>itself</em> will halt depends on the output of the <code>halts?</code> predicate in the <code>if</code> statement inside it.</p>
        <p>The expression <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts-reporter-reporter.png" alt="halts (reporter) (reporter)" title="halts (reporter) (reporter)" /> asks what will happen if we call the inputted function (<var>reporter</var>) with <em>itself</em> as its own input (like <code>round(round())</code> if <code>round</code> were the inputted function). This is similar to when Betsy made a statement about the statement she was making when she said, "The statement I'm making <em>right now</em> is false."</p>
        
        <div class="endnote">
            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
            This <em>is</em> challenging. Stick with it! We are <em>creating a contradiction</em> to prove that the <code>halts?</code> function inside <code>tester</code> can't exist. 
        </div>
        
        <h4><strong>Using Self-Reference to Lead to Contradiction</strong></h4>
        <p>
            To make the situation <em>exactly</em> like what Betsy said ("The statement I'm making <em>right now </em>is false."), we'll call <code>tester</code> on <em>itself</em>:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/testertester.png" alt="tester(tester())" title="tester(tester())" /><br />
            Now, the <code>if</code> statement inside the <code>tester</code> block will ask if <code>tester</code> will halt (not run forever) if it's called with <code>tester</code> as its input. The predicate in the <code>if</code> statement will become:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts-tester-tester.png" alt="halts (tester ()) (tester ())" title="halts (tester ()) (tester ())" />
        </p>
        <p>So, just as in the examples above,</p>
        <p class="indent"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts-tester-tester-reporting-true.png" alt="halts (tester) (tester) reporting true" title="halts (tester) (tester) reporting true" /> would mean that <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/testertester.png" alt="tester(tester())" title="tester(tester())" /> returns a value.</p>
        <p class="indent"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts-tester-tester-reporting-false.png" alt="halts (tester) (tester) reporting false" title="halts (tester) (tester) reporting false" /> would mean that <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/testertester.png" alt="tester(tester())" title="tester(tester())" /> loops indefinitely.</p>
        
        <div class="endnote">
            Calling a function with itself as input (recursion) isn't the problem. You used recursion when you called <code>nested square</code> inside itself to create fractal art in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-abstraction/2-fractal-art.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 2 Lab 4: Fractal Art">Unit 2 Lab 4</a>. But in this case&mdash;because <code>halts?</code> is impossible to code correctly&mdash;we end up with a contradiction.

        </div>
        
        <h4><strong>Understanding the Contradiction</strong></h4>
        <p>
        	When we call <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/testertester.png" alt="tester(tester())" title="tester(tester())" />, we run into the contradiction. To see how, look back at the <code>tester</code> definition:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/tester-halting.png" alt="tester(function){if(halts?(function)(function){forever{}}else{report(true)}}" title="tester(function){if(halts?(function)(function){forever{}}else{report(true)}}">
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the two possible cases:
            <ol>
                <li>If <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts-tester-tester-reporting-true.png" alt="halts (tester) (tester) reports true" title="halts (tester) (tester) reports true" /> then <code>tester</code> will take the first branch of the <code>if</code>, and so it will loop forever. That means <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/testertester.png" alt="tester(tester())" title="tester(tester())" /> <em>won't</em> halt, and so <code>halts?</code> gave the wrong answer.</li>
                <li>If <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts-tester-tester-reporting-false.png" alt="halts (tester) (tester) reports false" title="halts (tester) (tester) reports false" /> then <code>tester</code> will take the <code>else</code> branch and report "It doesn't matter what value is reported." That means <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/testertester.png" alt="tester(tester())" title="tester(tester())" /> <em>will</em> halt, and so <code>halts?</code> is wrong again.</li>
            </ol>
		</p>
        <div class="endnote">It doesn't matter <em>what</em> value <code>tester</code> reports, just that it reports <em>some</em> value, but it <em>does</em> matter what value <code>halts?</code> reports.</div>
        
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p>No matter what <code>halts?</code> reports, it will always disagree with itself in a program like this. <strong>This contradiction (this logical impossibility) means that the assumption that it's possible write <code>halts?</code> has to be wrong</strong>. This isn't just a claim about what will happen in Snap<em>!</em>. The language you use to explore a computational problem can impact the clarity or readability of your code but not whether a solution to a problem exists. Even with advances in quantum computing, we will never be able to create a general-purpose debugging program. This famous example is known as "the halting problem."</p>

            <p>Leaving this for the TG. --MF, 1/9/18</p>
            <p>It's crucial to the proof that the function given as input to <code>halts?</code> takes an input, and that <code>tester</code> is written so that it tests that function <em>with itself as input.</em> It's tempting to leave out the second input in <code>halts?</code>, but this is how we get the self-reference that leads to a contradiction proving that there can be no such <code>halts?</code> function.</p>
            <ul><li>I wrote that bit about recursion to addresses how the self-reference leads to contradiction, but the bit about the second input being essential is (I hope) clearer with this rewrite, and I didn't mention it on this student page. --MF, 1/9/18</li></ul>

                <p>Alan Turing (1912-1954) was one of the founders of computer science. He is known for two achievements. First, he made a massive contribution to winning World War II by inventing a mathematical theory and corresponding computer hardware to break the encoded messages generated by the Germans. Second, together with his colleague Alonzo Church, Turing was a founder of <em>theoretical computer science</em>: proving how computers <em>must</em> work regardless of future technology. Though his work on the "halting problem," he proved that <em>there are computations that can never be done</em>, no matter how big and fast computers get.</p>
                <p>When Turing did this work, there were no programmable computers; people had to rewire physical machines to solve each new problem. With today's programming languages (like Snap<em>!</em>), we can see and understand the essence of Turing's proof much more easily because we can use functions as inputs to other functions, as you've seen with <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, <code>for each</code>, and <code>combine</code>. This proof was even harder for Turing because he had to invent the idea of a computer program that can itself be represented as data inside the computer.</p>
