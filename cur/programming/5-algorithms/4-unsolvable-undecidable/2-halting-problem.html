            Alan Turing (1912-1954) was one of the founders of computer science. He is known for two achievements. First, he made a massive contribution to winning World War II, by inventing a mathematical theory and corresponding computer hardware to break the encoded messages generated by the Germans.
            <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/turing.jpg" alt="Alan Turing" title="Alan Turing" />
            Second, together with his colleague Alonzo Church, Turing was a founder of <em>theoretical computer science</em>: proving how computers <em>must</em> work regardless of future technology.  He proved that <em>there are computations that can never be done</em>, no matter how big and fast computers get.
		</p>
        <div class="endnote">When Turing did this work, there were no programmable computers; people had to rewire physical machines to solve each new problem. With today's programming languages, we can see and understand the essence of Turing's proof much more easily.</div>
           
        <h3>The Halting Theorem</h3>
        <p>By this point in the course, you've experienced the frustration of debugging a program. Wouldn't it be great if there were a <strong>general-purpose debugging program</strong> that could read any code and find all the bugs? Alan Turing proved that this can't be done.</p>
        <p>Turing used a <em>proof by contradiction,</em> just like Alphie, Betsy, and Gamal on the previous page. Turing <em>assumed</em> he could write a function to find all infinite loops in a program (situations in which a function runs forever without reporting a value). Then, he used that function in a program and found a <em>contradiction</em> (a logical incompatibility), which proved that his assumption was wrong&mdash;<strong>no such program can exist</strong>.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Consider this <code>halts?</code> function. It takes two inputs, a function and an input value for that function, and it reports <code>true</code> if the function would report a value (and halt) or <code>false</code> if the function would run forever.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts.png" alt="halts? (function) (input)" title="halts? (function) (input)" /><br />
					For example, the function <code>round</code> will not run forever when given the input 7.5; it will report 8. So, <code>halts (round) (</code><var>7.5</var><code>)</code> will report <code>true</code> because <code>round (</code><var>7.5</var><code>)</code> will eventually halt.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts-reporting.png" alt="halts?(round())(7.5) reporting true" title="halts?(round())(7.5) reporting true" />
					<div class="endnote">Note that <code>halts?</code> itself can't run forever. We are assuming that it always works, reporting an answer in a finite amount of time.</div>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
		<p>
            Then, Turing defined a function like this:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/tester-halting.png" alt="tester(function){if(halts?(function)(function){forever{}}else{report(true)}}" title="tester(function){if(halts?(function)(function){forever{}}else{report(true)}}">
        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="2">
                <li>
                	Review this <code>tester</code> function closely.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Notice that the <code>forever</code> block creates an infinite loop. If the <code>tester</code> code ends up in this part of the <code>if</code> statement, it will never report anything.</li>
                        <li>
                        	Look at the <code>halts?</code> block in the definition. Turing is asking what happens if we call some function with <em>itself</em> as its input (like <code>round(round())</code>).
        					<div class="endnote">This is similar to Betsy making a statement about "this statement" (namely, "this statement is false"). This is easy to do in Snap<em>!</em> because it allows functions as inputs to other functions, as you saw in Unit 3.  It wasn't easy for Turing, who had to invent the idea of a computer <em>program</em> that can itself be represented as data inside the computer.</div>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Turing then asked a question that makes the situation <em>exactly</em> like what Betsy said; he calls tester on <em>itself</em>:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/testertester.png" alt="tester(tester())" title="tester(tester())" /><br />
            Now, the <code>if</code> statement will ask if <code>tester</code> will halt (i.e., not run forever) if it's called with <code>tester</code> as input.
        </p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="3">
                <li>
					<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
                    Consider the two possibilities for the <code>if</code> statement inside <code>tester</code>:
                    <ol>
						<li>Suppose <code>halts?</code> reports <code>true</code>. This would tell us that <code>tester(tester)</code> succeeds at reporting a value (it halts). Then <code>tester</code> takes the first branch of the <code>if</code>, and so <code>tester</code> loops forever (it doesn't halt).</li>
                        <li>Now suppose instead that <code>halts?</code> reports <code>false</code>. This would tell us that <code>tester(tester)</code> loops forever (it doesn't halt). In that case, <code>tester</code> takes the <code>else</code> branch, and reports <code>true</code> (it does halt). </li>
						<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/tester-halting.png" alt="tester(function){if(halts?(function)(function){forever{}}else{report(true)}}" title="tester(function){if(halts?(function)(function){forever{}}else{report(true)}}">
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p>This contradiction means that the assumption that it's possible write <code>halts?</code> has to be wrong.  Turing's "halting problem" has been proven to be impossible, and because of this proof, nobody tries to write a perfect infinite loop checker.</p>
            <p>Turing used this example to prove that <strong>there are functions that can't be computed at all</strong>. And this isn't just a claim about the particular computers that existed in Turing's time, or today. Even with advances in quantum computing, we <em>still</em> won't be able to solve the halting problem.</p>
