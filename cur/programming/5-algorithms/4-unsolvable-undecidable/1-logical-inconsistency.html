					Imagine an island somewhere with two large families. One family (unlike normal people) can tell only the truth, even when they'd rather lie. This Truthteller family <em>can't ever</em> make false statements, even by mistake. The other family, the False-Teller family, is just as reliable but in the opposite way: they can't make true statements ever.
                    <p>You are visiting the island and meet two of its people, Adam and Eve.</p> 
                    <p>Adam says, "Eve and I are from the same family."</p>

                    A <strong>proof by contradiction</strong> is a two-step proof that something is false that is done by:

            <div><span>Gamal:</span> Sometimes it's easier to prove that something is false than to prove that something is true.  So let's <em>assume the opposite</em> of what you want to prove, and see where that leads us.  So we assume that Eve is a False-teller.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Okay. So if Adam is a Truthteller, then what he said is true, and they are from the same family, the Truthtellers. But we assumed that Eve is a False-teller, so they're actually from different families, and so Adam can't be a Truthteller.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> So, Adam has to be a False-teller.</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> But that won't work either! If Adam is a False-teller, then what he said is false, and they are from different families. But they are both False-tellers, so they're actually in the same family, and so Adam can't be a False-teller either.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> No matter what family Adam is from, our assumption that Eve is a False-teller led us to a <em>contradiction</em>. Eve can't be a False-teller, so has to be a Truthteller. We proved it.</div>
            <div class="todo">
              <p>This made Mary-the-student wonder if this really works. What if this is an unsolvable or undecidable problem? How do we know that Eve's not being a False-teller means she <em>has</em> to be a Truthteller? I mean, Mary-the-student would have thought that before doing this lab, but now she's pretty mixed up about these things. Can we say something concrete to help her? --MF, 1/3/18</p>
              <p>I don't think we should dump all the categories on them at once. So I propose to leave this here but come back to this problem after they understand paradoxical statements. See notes below. --bh</p>

		<div><span>Gamal:</span> That's very clever, Betsy.  It can't be true <em>or</em> false.  Hmm, maybe our analysis of Adam's statement wasn't perfect.  We proved that Eve can't be a False-teller, but we'd better make sure she <em>can</em> be a <em>Truth-teller.</em></div>
        <div><span>Betsy:</span> But that part's easy.  We no longer have to prove that she <em>must</em> be a Truth-teller, just that there's <em>some</em> possibility that's consistent.  So, let's try the case that they're both Truth-tellers.  Adam's statement is then true, so there's no contradiction.</div></div>

	  <p>This seems both important (like orange-box important) and <em>wrong</em> (if Adam's statement is undecidable, why did we conclude something above?) --MF, 1/3/18</p>

		<div class=takeNote>Some statements, such as Betsy's, are <em>inconsistent</em>, self-contradictory, and can be neither True nor False. Some, like &quot;Adam is a Truth-teller,&quot; cannot be determined with the information we have so far, but <em>could</em> be either True or False. And some, like &quot;Eve is a Truth-teller,&quot; can be proven correct or proven incorrect.</div>
