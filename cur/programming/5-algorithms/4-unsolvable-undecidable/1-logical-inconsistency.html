                	Imagine an island somewhere with two large families. One family (unlike us "normals") can tell only the truth, even when they'd rather lie. The Truthteller family <em>can't ever</em> make false statements, even by mistake. The other family, the False-Teller family, is just as reliable, but in the opposite way: they can't make true statements. Ever.
                    <p>You are visiting the island and meet two of its people, Adam and Eve.</p> 
                    <p>Adam says "Eve and I are from the same family."</p> 
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Can you say for sure which family Eve is from?</li>
                            <li>Can you say for sure which family Adam is from?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>

        <div class="dialogue">
			<div><span>Betsy: </span> I'm pretty sure Eve is a Truthteller, but I don't know how to prove it.</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> Sometimes it's easier to prove that something is <em>false</em> than to prove that something is true.  So let's <em>assume the opposite</em> of what you want to prove, and see where that leads us.  So we're going to assume that Eve is a False-teller.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Okay.  Now suppose Adam is a Truthteller.  If Eve is a False-teller, they're from different families, and what Adam said is false, but that can't be.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> So Adam has to be a False-teller.</div>
            <div><span>Gamal:</span> But that won't work either!  If Adam and Eve are both False-tellers, they're in the same family, so Adam has to say the opposite of what he said.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> So either way, the assumption that Eve is a False-teller led us to a contradiction.  So Eve <em>can't</em> be a False-teller, so she's a Truthteller, and we proved it.</div>

            <div><span>Alphie: </span> I can't believe the two of you!</div>

            <ol start="3">
                <li>Betsy claims her statement is False? What do <em>you</em> think? Make sure you can explain your idea clearly.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>


		<p>Some statements are <em>inconsistent</em>, self-contradictory, and can be neither True nor False. Some, like Adam's statement, cannot be determined with the information we have so far, but <em>could</em> be either True or False. </p>


        <div class="forYouToDo">
        	<ol start="4">
                <li>What questions <em>can</em> you ask to determine, for sure, whether a person is a Truthteller or a False-Teller? (Talking with others, figure out at least four questions that will  work reliably.)</li>
                <li>You've developed a "test." If Adam were a Truthteller, how would he answer your questions? Check to make sure that if he were a False-Teller, he'd answer differently.</li>
        	</ol>
        </div>

		<p>Problem 5 asked you to devise a "test" to determine whether the person you've met is a Truthteller or a False-Teller. Some statements, as you will see in part 2 of this lab, <em>could</em> be True or False, but we can <em>prove</em> that no test could be devised to determine the Truth or Falsity of the statement.</p>

            <ol type="A">
            	<li>On that island of Truthtellers and False-Tellers, you meet Max and Min. Max says "She and I are both liars!" Which kind of statement is this? Is it self-contradictory? Is it indeterminate (it could be either, but there's no way to tell)? Or is it definitely resolvable?</li>
            </ol>
