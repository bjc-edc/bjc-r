        <div class="sidenoteBig">Puzzles like these are famous among mathematicians and computer scientists. In fact, there's a whole branch of mathematics devoted to the logic that is behind puzzles like these.</div>
        <li>Imagine an island somewhere, with two large families. One family (unlike us "normals") can tell only the truth, even when they'd rather lie. The Truthteller family <em>can't ever</em> make false statements, even by mistake. The False-Teller family is just as reliable, but in the opposite way: they can't make true statements. Ever.
           <p>You are visiting the island and meet two of its people, Adam and Eve.</p> 
           <p>Adam says "Eve and I are from the same family."</p> 
           <p>Can you say for sure what family Eve is from?</p>
           <p>Can you say for sure what family Adam is from?</p>
        </li>
        <li>You meet someone Derek and ask him if he's from the Truthteller family.  What does he answer? What if you ask Derek if he's from the False-Teller family?</li>
        
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
                <div><span>Betsy: </span> The statement I'm making <em>right now</em> is false. </div>
                <div><span>Gamal: </span> <em>(in a bored tone) </em>Whatever you say, Betsy.</div>
                <em>Gamal thinks a moment.</em>
                <div><span>Gamal: </span>Wait!  <em><strong>What??!!!!</strong></em></div>
                <div><span>Alphie: </span> I can't believe the two of you!</div>
                <div><span>Gamal: </span> Hey, Betsy, that's cool!</div>
                <em>Alphie sighs and walks off to lunch.</em>
  </div>
  
<div class="forYouToDo">
    <ol start = "3">
        <li>Betsy claims her statement is False? What do <em>you</em> think? Make sure you can explain your idea clearly.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

Some statements are <em>inconsistent</em>, self-contradictory, and can be neither True nor False. Some, like Adam's statement, cannot be determined with the information we have so far, but <em>could</em> be either True or False. 
<div class="forYouToDo">
    <ol start = "4">
        <li>What questions <em>can</em> you ask to determine, for sure, whether a person is a Truthteller or a False-Teller? (Talking with others, figure out at least four questions that will  work reliably.)</li>
        <li>You've developed a "test." If Adam were a Truthteller, how would he answer your questions? Check to make sure that if he were a False-Teller, he'd answer differently.
  </ol>
</div>

Problem 5  asked you to devise a "test" to determine whether the person you've met is a Truthteller or a False-Teller. Some statements, as you will see in part 2 of this lab, <em>could</em> be True or False, but we can <em>prove</em> that no test could be devised to determine the Truth or Falsity of the statement.

    <div class="takeItFurther">
    <ol type="A">
        <li>On that island of Truthtellers and False-Tellers, you meet Max and Min. Max says "She and I are both liars!" Which kind of statement is this? Is it self-contradictory? Is it indeterminate (it could be either, but there's no way to tell)? Or is it definitely resolvable?</li>
    </ol>
