		<h2>Comparing Algorithms</h2>

        <div class="sidenoteBig">This introductory box is a new design feature that the BJC development team is considering using throughout the student lab pages. Its goal is to help students anticipate what they will be working on.<br />Is it helpful to you? How could we make it better? Please use the blue feedback button at the bottom to support BJC with your ideas!</div>

            <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will learn that some ways to solve a problem are faster than others.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will compare two algorithms for adding all numbers from 1 to an input number and figure out which is faster.</p>

                Alphie and Betsy are creating algorithms that take a positive integer as input and report the sum of all integers from 1 to the input number, like this: <br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/sum-from-1-to-13-reporting.png" alt="" title="" /><br />
                Their two different approaches always give the same outputs for the same inputs. Alphie and Betsy are discussing their different approaches.

            <div><span>Alphie: </span> I made two new blocks. First, I created a reporter to list of all the integers between and including two integers, and then I used <code>combine</code> to add up the list.</div>

                    The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/combine.png" alt="combine" title="combine" /> block takes an operation (with <em>two</em> blank input slots) and a list as input, and it reports a single result (not a list): the combination of the elements in the list when using the given operation. For example:<br />
                    <div class="sidenote">Read this out loud as "combine the elements of  the list 5, 6, 2, 3 with addition."</div>

                <div class="sidenoteBig"><code>Combine</code> is a <em>higher order function</em>. This means that it is a function that takes a function as input. You've seen several higher order functions already: <code>for each</code> (in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/1-the-for-each-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 2 Lab 2</a>), <code>keep</code> (in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/2-keeping-list-items.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 2 Lab 3</a>), and <code>map</code> (in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-introduction-to-lists/5-mapping-over-list.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 3 Lab 1</a>).</div>
                    <p>You choose the operation, and <code>combine</code> performs that operation by <em>combining</em> all the items in the input list and then reports the result.</p>
                    <p>Notice that the function used to <em>combine</em> the list items always has two blank input slots. Both <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> only need one blank in their input function, but with <code>combine</code>, two are required.</p>

                <div class="endnote">
                    Unlike <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code>, <code>combine</code> is mostly used with one of <em>only these six</em> functions:<br />

                    Among blocks you might write yourself, there are only two likely candidates:<br />

                    <div id="hint-3" class="collapse">
                    	The function has to be <em>associative</em>, meaning that it doesn't matter what order you group the items in; (7&thinsp;+&thinsp;8)&thinsp;+&thinsp;1 is the same as 7&thinsp;+&thinsp;(8&thinsp;+&thinsp;1) (work it out yourself), but (7&thinsp;−&thinsp;8)&thinsp;−&thinsp;1 is different from 7&thinsp;−&thinsp;(8&thinsp;−&thinsp;1).
                    	So <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine-minus.png" alt="combine with (-) items of (list 7 8 1)"> would be ambiguous.
