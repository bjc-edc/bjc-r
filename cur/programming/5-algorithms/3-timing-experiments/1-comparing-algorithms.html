        <div class="sidenoteBig">This introductory box is a new design feature that the BJC development team is considering using throughout the student lab pages. Its goal is to help students anticipate what they will be working on.<br />Is it helpful to you? How could we make it better? Please use the blue feedback button at the bottom to support BJC with your ideas!</div>

            <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will learn that some ways to solve a problem are faster than others.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will compare two algorithms for adding all numbers from 1 to an input number and figure out which is faster.</p>

                Alphie and Betsy are creating algorithms that take a positive integer as input and report the sum of all integers from 1 to the input number, like this: <br />

                Their two different approaches always give the same outputs for the same inputs. Alphie and Betsy are discussing their different approaches.

            <div><span>Alphie: </span> I made two new blocks. First, I created a reporter to list of all the integers between and including two integers, and then I used <code>combine</code> to add up the list.</div>
