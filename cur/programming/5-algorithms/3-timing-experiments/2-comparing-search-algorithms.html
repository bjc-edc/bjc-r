    	<h2>A Distinct List Algorithm</h2>
		
<div class="comment">EK: 4.1.2A, 4.1.2B</div>
		
        <p>
        	Suppose you have a list of numbers and want to know if the numbers in the list are <em>distinct</em>, with no repetitions. This kind of question pops up frequently: for example, a Web search engine would want to be sure all of the search results are different from each other. Here is one algorithm to solve the problem:<div class="sidenote">Algorithms can be expressed in natural language or in <em>pseudocode</em>, text that describes the steps a program might carry out. These languages for human understanding may help write the algorithm in a programming language.</div>
        	<ul>
            	<li><strong>Step 1</strong>. Take the first number of the list. Compare it with the numbers later in the list (the second number, the third, etc.). If you see the starting number again, report that the numbers <em>are not</em> distinct.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2</strong>. If you complete Step 1 without stopping, take the second number of the list. Compare it with the numbers later in the list (the third number, the fourth, etc.). If you see it again, report that the numbers <em>are not</em> distinct.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3</strong>. Repeat Step 2 for each number in the list. Take that number and compare it with the numbers later in the list.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4.</strong> If you complete Step 3 without finding any duplicates, report that the numbers <em>are</em> distinct.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
