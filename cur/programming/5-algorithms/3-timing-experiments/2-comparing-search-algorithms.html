    	<h2>Comparing Search Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
        	Consider the following problem: You have a list of numbers and  want to know if the numbers in the list are <em>distinct</em>. In other words, you want to know if there are any repetitions in your list. This kind of question pops up frequently in computer science: for example, when returning search results, Google would like to make sure that all of the search results are different from each other. Here is a first attempt at an algorithm to solve the problem:
        	<ul>
            	<li><strong>Step 1</strong>. You take the first number of the list, and compare it with each of the other numbers in the list (the second number, the third number, and so on). If, at any point, you see the same number again, stop and tell the user that the numbers are not distinct.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2</strong>. If you complete step 1 without stopping,  take the second number of the list, and compare it with each of the other numbers in the list (the third number, the fourth number, and so on). If, at any point, you see the same number again, stop and tell the user that the numbers are not distinct.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3</strong>. Repeat the two steps above for all of the numbers in the list, each time taking a number from the list and comparing it with each of the following numbers.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4.</strong> If you are done with all of the numbers in the list,  stop and tell the user that the numbers <em>are</em> distinct.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
