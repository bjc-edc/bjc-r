    	<h2>A Distinct Difference</h2>
        <div class="todo">Seems like this should be a new lab... --MF</div>
        <p> Consider the following problem: You have a list of numbers and  want to know if the numbers in the list are <em>distinct</em>. In other words, I want to know if there are any repetitions in my list. This kind of question pops up frequently in computer science: for example, when returning search results, Google would like to make sure that all of the search results are different from each other. Here is a first attempt at an algorithm to solve the problem:</p> 
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong>. I take the first number of the list, and compare it with each of the other numbers in the list (the second number, the third number, and so on). If, at any point, I see the same number again, I stop and tell the user that the numbers are not distinct.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><br /></span> <strong>Step 2</strong>. If I complete step 1 without stopping, I take the second number of the list, and compare it with each of the other numbers in the list (the third number, the fourth number, and so on). If, at any point, I see the same number again, I stop and tell the user that the numbers are not distinct.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><br /></span> <strong>Step 3</strong>. I repeat the two steps above for all of the numbers in the list, each time taking a number from the list and comparing it with each of the following numbers.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4.</strong> If I am done with all of the numbers in the list, I stop and tell the user that the numbers <em>are</em> distinct.</p>

<div class="comment">AC:  I have the predicate built (with a "?" at the end).  I can't get a script pict to show the output, and I can't get the graphic to display, anyway.  Shouldn't they see the recursive version?</div>
