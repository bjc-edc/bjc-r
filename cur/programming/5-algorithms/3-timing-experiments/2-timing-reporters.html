        <p>
            This block can be used to time how long a reporter takes to output. Here’s an algorithm:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Create a variable <var>start time</var> and set it to the current time.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Call the reporter that you're trying to time.  Ignore the result.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> When the reporter finishes, get the current time and subtract <var>start time</var> from it.</li>
            </ul>

A block called <code>time function</code> is provided that takes any reporter (with its inputs filled in), computes the result, but reports <em>how long it took</em> to do the computation.  The answer will be in milliseconds.  Take a minute to review the code in <code>time function</code>.</li>

                    In <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/2-improving-search.html" title="Analyzing and Improving Searches">Lab 1</a> you built two reporters that output the position of an element in a list. The reporter <code>position of __ in unsorted list</code> works for any list as a <em>linear search</em>, checking element-by-element until it finds a match (or gets to the end and reports &quot;Not In List&quot;). The reporter <code>position of __ in sorted list</code> works on sorted lists as a <em>binary search</em> algorithm. So, both will work on sorted lists. Compare them for some long sorted lists and make a table of your findings.	 You may have to use very large lists, say 1000 or 2000 items, to get meaningful results.
