<div class=takeNote>
        <p>These two algorithms may be the same as <em>functions</em> (they always give the same answers for the same inputs), but they are different internally. Computer programs are judged not only by what they do; they are also judged by how long it takes them to do it, especially as the size of the inputs grows. Different correct algorithms for the same problem can have different efficiencies, and can provide different insights to the same problem.</p>
		<p>In this lab, you’ll investigate how long an algorithm takes to compute its output, and classify algorithms by this "efficiency" criterion.</p>
