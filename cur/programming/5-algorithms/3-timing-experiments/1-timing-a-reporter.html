    	<h2>Timing a Reporter</h2>
		<div class="sidenote">You've built one model of  this summing block in an earlier unit.</div>
		<p>Different people often create different reporters to do the same job.  For example, you can create a reporter that adds up all the whole numbers between 1 and some limit.</p>
        
        <div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>Alphie: </span> I want to create a function that takes an input <span class="katex">n</span> and adds up all the whole numbers between 1 and <span class="katex">n</span>.  First I'll create a reporter that creates the list of these numbers, then I'll just use <code>combine</code>.</div>
            <div class="stagedir">

            <div><span>Alphie: </span> Of course you do.  What is it?</div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> I imagine my list of numbers arranged as you do, from, say, 1 to 13.  And then I write the same numbers in reverse order, right under my first list, like this:</div>

            <div><span>Betsy: </span> Oh, yeah.  I added the numbers twice, so the answer is <span class="katex">\frac {182}2</span>, or 91, as you said.</div>
			<div><span>Alphie: </span> And if you wanted to add the numbers from 1 to 50, you'd get <span class="katex">50\times 51</span> divided by 2 or 1275.  In general...</div>
			<div><span>Betsy:</span> ...to add the numbers between 1 and <span class="katex">n</span>, you calculate <span class="katex">n\times(n+1)</span> and divide by 2.</div>

        <p>This script will reset the timer whenever the green flag is pressed. The sprite will say "Hello!" for 1 second, then say the current time (less 1 second to account for how long the sprite said "Hello!").</p>
        <p>If we replace "Hello!" with a reporter, then the sprite will say the value reported by reporter, and one second later, it will say how long the reporter took to generate that response: this is the timing information that we need for the upcoming pages in this lab.</p>
