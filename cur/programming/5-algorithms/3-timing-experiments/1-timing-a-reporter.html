    	<h2>Timing a Reporter</h2>
		<div class="sidenote">You've built one model of  this summing block in an earlier unit.</div>
		<p>Different people often create different reporters to do the same job.  For example, you can create a reporter that adds up all the whole numbers between 1 and some limit.</p>
        
        <div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>Alphie: </span> I want to create a function that takes an input <span class="katex">n</span> and adds up all the whole numbers between 1 and <span class="katex">n</span>.  First I'll create a reporter that creates the list of these numbers, then I'll just use <code>combine</code>.</div>
            <div class="stagedir">
                Alphie shows his work:<br />
                <div class="comment">I can't get the scriptpict for listbetween to show the output, and I can't get the pict  combineaddit to show at all.  Blah. (Al, please create new script pics <em>with results</em> and replace the files. If that Snap features is not working, please touch base. --MF)</div>

            <div><span>Betsy: </span> I know another way.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie: </span> Of course you do.  What is it?</div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> I imagine my list of numbers arranged as you do, from, say, 1 to 13.  And then I write the same numbers in reverse order, right under my first list, like this:</div>
			 <div/ class="stagedir">
               Betsy writes on the board:<br />
			<div><span class="katex-block">\begin{array}{ccccccccccccc}
1 & 2 & 3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12&13\\
13&12&11&10&9&8&7&6&5&4&3&2&1
\end{array}</span></div>

<div><span class="katex-block">\begin{array}{ccccccccccccc}
&1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12&13\\
+&13&12&11&10&9&8&7&6&5&4&3&2&1\\ \hline
&14&14&14&14&14&14&14&14&14&14&14&14&14 
\end{array}</span>
</div>
</div>

<div><span>Betsy: </span> So I have 13 14s and my answer is <span class="katex">13\times 14</span> or 182..</div>
			
			
			
            <div><span>Alphie: </span> But the answer is 91.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> Oh, yeah.  I added the numbers twice, so the answer is <span class="katex">\frac {182}2</span>, or 91, as you said.</div>
			
			 <div><span>Alphie: </span> And if you wanted to add the numbers from 1 to 50, you'd get <span class="katex">50\times 51</span> divided by 2 or 1275.  In general<span class="katex">\dots</span></div>
			
			<div><span>Betsy:</span><span class="katex"> \dots </span> to add the numbers between 1 and <span class="katex">n</span>, you calculate <span class="katex">n\times(n+1)</span> and divide by 2.



WORKPOINT

        </div>
        
        <p>This script will reset the timer whenever the green flag is pressed. The sprite will say "Hello!" for 1 second, then say the current time (less 1 second to account for how long the sprite said "Hello!").</p>
        <p>If we replace "Hello!" with a reporter, then the sprite will say the value reported by reporter, and one second later, it will say how long the reporter took to generate that response: this is the timing information that we need for the upcoming pages in this lab.</p>
