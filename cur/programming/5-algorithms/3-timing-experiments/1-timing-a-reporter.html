    	<h2>Timing a Reporter</h2>
		    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
			<div class="sidenote">You've built one model of  this summing block in an earlier unit.</div>
        <p>
        	Different people often create different reporters to do the same job.  For example, you can create a reporter that adds up all the whole numbers between 1 and some limit.
        </p>
<div class="dialogue">
                <div><span>Alphie: </span> I want to create a function that takes an input <span class="katex">n</span> and adds up all the whole numbers between 1 and <span class="katex">n</span>.  First I'll create a reporter that creates the list of these numbers, then I'll just hit it with <code>combine</code>.</div>
		 <div class="stagedir">
				Alphie shows his work.
				
<div class="sidenote">I can't get the scriptpict for listbetween to show the output, and I can't get the pict  combineaddit to show at all.  Blah.</div>

                <div><span>Betsy: </span> I got it in 4 guesses once. I think that's the best you can do.</div>
                <div><span>Gamal: </span> If you were <em>really</em> lucky, you could have gotten it in one guess.  Maybe your 4 is luck, too!</div>
                <div><span>Betsy: </span> But I have a strategy.</div>
                <div><span>Gamal: </span> You have a strategy that will always work in 4 guesses?!</div>
                <div><span>Betsy: </span> Not always 4, but  always a lot less than 12.</div>

        <p>This script will reset the timer whenever the green flag is pressed. The sprite will say "Hello!" for 1 second, then say the current time (less 1 second to account for how long the sprite said "Hello!").</p>
        <p>If we replace "Hello!" with a reporter, then the sprite will say the value reported by reporter, and one second later, it will say how long the reporter took to generate that response: this is the timing information that we need for the upcoming pages in this lab.</p>
