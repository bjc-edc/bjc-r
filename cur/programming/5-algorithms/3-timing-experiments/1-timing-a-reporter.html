    	<h2>Timing a Reporter</h2>
		<div class="sidenote">You've built one model of  this summing block in an earlier unit.</div>
		<p>Different people often create different reporters to do the same job.  For example, you can create a reporter that adds up all the whole numbers between 1 and some limit.</p>
        
        <div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>Alphie: </span> I want to create a function that takes an input <span class="katex">n</span> and adds up all the whole numbers between 1 and <span class="katex">n</span>.  First I'll create a reporter that creates the list of these numbers, then I'll just use <code>combine</code>.</div>
            <div class="stagedir">
                Alphie shows his work:<br />

            <div><span>Alphie: </span> Of course you do.  What is it?</div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> I imagine my list of numbers arranged as you do, from, say, 1 to 13.  And then I write the same numbers in reverse order, right under my first list, like this:</div>

        <p>Both methods do the same job—they add all the whole numbers up to some ceiling that you specify. But look a little more closely. As the size of the upper limit grows, you’ll see that Alphie’s method starts to slow down, while Betsy is as fast as ever (so far as you can detect). Try it.</p>

		<h3>Ways to Think About It</h3>
        <p>Both methods may be mathematically equal as <em>functions</em> (they do the same thing to all inputs), but they are very different from a computer science perspective. Computer programs are judged not only by what they do; they are also judged by how long it takes them to do it, especially as the size of the inputs grows. In this lab, you’ll investigate a <code>function timer</code> that allows you to investigate how long a reporter takes to compute its output, and you’ll classify reporters by this “efficiency” criterion.</p>
