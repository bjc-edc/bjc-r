		<h2>Classifying Reporters</h2>
        
        <p> The reporter <code>average time</code> takes two inputs: a reporter (with input) and the number of times you want to repeat the reporter's work. The image below says that the <code>alphie way</code> of adding the integers from 1 to 100 was performed 10 times, and the average of the times it took was 12.8 milleseconds.</p>
        <div class="sidenote">You may have created <code>average time </code> on the previous page.  If you didn't, try it now or open this script.</div>
		<p><a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/U5L3avtime.xml"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/avtime.png" alt="average alphie" title="average alphie" /></a></p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
            	<li>Experiment with <code>average time</code> on some of the reporters you've built like <code>alphie way</code>, <code>betsy way</code>, <code>factorial</code>, <code>find in usorted list</code>, <code>find in sorted list</code>, and any others you have handy. </li>    
            </ol>
        </div> 
        
        <p>
            It would be nice to create a data-plot of the average time it takes a reporter to ouput, given a list of inputs. To do this, you'll want to create a list. The reporter <code> make a list of times for a reporter between two inputs </code> creates such a list. Here's how it looks in action:<br />
            <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/U5L3avtime.xml"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/listtimes.png" alt="average alphie" title="average alphie" /></a>
        </p>
        
        <div class="sidenote">You can create the block for yourself. Try it. Or you can click to load a pre-programmed version.</div>
        
        <p>
            What's happened here is that Alphie's reporter (adding the numbers between 1 and some upper limit) was applied to upper limits between  100 and 10000, and <code>average time</code>'d along the way.  The input 2 specifies what "along the way" means:  these special inputs start with 100 and are multiplied by 2 until you get the largest multiple less than 10000:<br />
            <table class="bordered center">
                <tr>
                    <td>100</td>
                    <td>200</td>
                    <td>400</td>
                    <td>800</td>
                    <td>1600</td>
                    <td>3200</td>
                    <td>6400</td>
                </tr>     
            </table>
        </p>
            
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="2">
            	<li>Experiment with <code>make a list of times for a reporter between two inputs</code>. Try different reporters that you've built as inputs and vary the other inputs  (for example instead of 2, try 1.5, 1.1, and so on). </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeNote">Because <code>make a list for a reporter between two inputs</code> often takes a long time to compute its output (think about what it's doing) you may want to store   outputs for various reporters in variables so that you can use them later. The reason that the last input multiplies by a factor (rather than making a constant increment) is so that you can get a large range of inputs without having to time the reporter on too many of them.</div>       
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">       
            <p>One way to analyze algorithms is to  use the <code> graph data points</code> package from U5L2 to plot the run time against the size of the input and to classify the reporters by the shape of the plots.</p>
            <ol start="3">
				<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/alphiepict.png" alt="" title="" />
            	<li>Try it.  Create a data plot of the reporters you timed in the problem above: Pick a reporter and make a data-plot for the output of <code>make a list for a reporter between two inputs</code>.</li>
            </ol> 
        </div>

		<h3>Ways to Think About It</h3>
        <p>
            The shape of the plots can be classified mathematically:
            <ul>
            	<li>The plot looks close to a horizontal line. This is called <em>constant time</em>.</li>
            	<li>The plot looks close to a non-horizontal line. This is called <em>linear time</em>.</li>
                <div class="sidenote">If the plot looks something like the graph of <span class="katex">y = x^2</span>, the growth is called <em>quadratic time.  </em></div>

            	<li>
                	The plot is not a line. There are several ways this can happen:
                	<ol>
                    	                       
                        <li>The plot looks close to the graph of a polynomial function (roughly like the graph of <span class="katex">y = x^n</span> for some positive integer <span class="katex">n</span>). This is called <em>polynomial time</em>.</li>
                        <li>The plot looks close to the graph of an exponential function, like <span class="katex">x \rightarrow 2^x</span> Guess what this kind of timing behavior is called. 
                        </li>
                        <li>There's  another kind of run-time that comes up often&#8212;you saw it when you looked at binary searches (like the guessing game). You'll analyze this type of reporter later in this lab. <div class="comment">Put a link here to page U5L1P2</div></li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
