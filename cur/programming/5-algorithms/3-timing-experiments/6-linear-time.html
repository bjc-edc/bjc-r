    	<h2>Linear Time</h2>
        
<p> In a previous lesson, you saw that the data-plots for some reporters looked close to a non-horizontal line.   One of these is <code>list between</code>&#8212;it reports the list of integers between its two inputs.</p> 

<p><img  src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/listbetween.png" alt="list between 11 and 16" title="list between11 and 16" /></p>
        
<div class="forYouToDo">
    <ol>
        <li>Make a list of the average time for <code>list between</code> using inputs from 200 to 10000, using a sacle factor of, say, 1.5.</li>
        
 <p><img  src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/listbetweenlist.png" alt="timing list between 200 and 1000" title="timing list between 200 and 1000" /></p>        
       
        <li><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Make a data-plot of your list.  Are your points close to a line?  
</li>
        <li>Look carefully at the data in your list.  The inputs increase by a constant scale factor.  If you used 1.5, they look something like this
      
      <table class="additiontable center">
                <tr>
                    <td>200, </td>
                    <td>300, </td>
                    <td>450, </td>
                    <td>675, </td>
                    <td>1012.5, </td>
                    <td>1518.75, </td>
                    <td>2278.125, </td>
                    <td>3417.1875, </td>
                    <td>5125.78125, </td>
                    <td>7688.671875</td>
                </tr> 
 </table>  
        
       How do the outputs (the average times) change? <div class="sidenote">What is an approximate equation for your data-plot? </div> Look for something close to regularity in the data. </li>
       
       <li>  Try a different scale factor&#8212;if you chose 1.5, try 2 or 1.1.  Perform the same experiment.  Do the average times change in any regular (or close to regular) way?
       
       
       
      
    </ol>
</div> 
         
<div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Why is the plot of average times close to a line?</div>   
           	<div><span>Betsy: </span> Think about the equation for a line, something like <span class="katex">y = 3x </span>.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie: </span> Well, lines have equations like <span class="katex">y = 3x +5</span></div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> Yeah, but the <span class="katex">+5</span> won't matter for huge inputs.  It's just noise.</div>
			<div><span>Alphie: </span> OK.  But I repeat, "Why is the plot of average times close to a line?" </div>
            <div class="stagedir">
                They think. 
            </div>	
             <div><span>Betsy: </span> Say, for example, that the average time is 3 times the  input.  The if the input is doubled, from, say, 7 to 14, what happens to the output?</div>
             <div><span>Alphie: </span>  It's doubled.   And  if the input is multiplied by 1.5, from, say, 200 to 350, what happens to the output?</div>
            
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> Yup&#8212;it gets multiplied by 1.5 </div>
