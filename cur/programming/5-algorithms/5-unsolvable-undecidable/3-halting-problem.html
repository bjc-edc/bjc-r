		<h2>An Undecidable Problem (Teacher's Choice)</h2>
        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/turing.jpg" alt="Alan Turing">
        <p>Alan Turing (1912-1954) was one of the founders of computer science. He is known for two achievements. First, he made a massive contribution to winning World War II, by inventing a mathematical theory and corresponding computer hardware to break the encoded messages generated by the Germans. Second, together with his colleague Alonzo Church, Turing was a founder of <em>theoretical computer science</em>: proving how computers <em>must</em> work regardless of future technology.  He proved that <em>there are computations that can never be done</em>, no matter how big and fast computers get.</p>
           
        <h3>The Halting Theorem</h3>
        <div class="sidenote">When Turing did this work, there were no programmable computers; people had to rewire physical machines to solve each new problem. With today's programming languages, we can see and understand the essence of Turing's proof much more easily.</div>
        <p>By this point in the course you've experienced the frustration of debugging a program. <strong>Wouldn't it be great if there were a general-purpose debugging program that could read any code and find all the bugs?</strong> Turing proved that this can't be done.</p>
        <p>Turing used a <em>proof by contradiction,</em> just like Alphie, Betsy, and Gamal on the previous page. Turing started by assuming he had could write a function to find all <em>infinite loops</em> in a program&mdash;situations in which a function runs forever without reporting a value. <em><strong>XXXXX He found a contradiction proving that this can't be done.</strong></em></p>
        <p>
        Consider this function.<br />
        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/halts.png" alt="halts? (function) (input)" title="halts? (function) (input)" /><br />
		It takes two inputs, a function and an input value for that function, and it reports <code>true</code> if the function would report a value or <code>false</code> if the function would run forever. <s>(Note that <code>halts?</code> itself can't run forever! We are assuming that it always works, reporting an answer in a finite amount of time.)</s></p>
		<p>
            Then, Turing defined a function like this:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/tester-halting.png" alt="tester(function)">
        </p>
    <p>Look at the <code>halts?</code> block in the definition. Turing is asking what happens if we call some function with <em>itself</em> as its input.  This is similar to Betsy making a statement about "this statement" (namely, "this statement is false"). This is easy to do in Snap<em>!</em> because it allows functions as inputs to other functions, as you saw in Unit 3.  It wasn't easy for Turing, who had to invent the idea of a computer <em>program</em> that can itself be represented as data inside the computer.</p>
        <p>
            Turing then asked a question that makes the situation <em>exactly</em> like what Betsy said; he calls tester on <em>itself:</em><br />
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/testertester.png" alt="tester(tester)" title="tester(tester)" />
        </p>
    <p>If <code>halts?</code> says that <code>tester</code> halts, <code>tester</code> makes sure not to halt! But if <code>halts?</code> says that <code>tester</code> <em>doesn't</em> halt, then <code>tester</code> immediately reports <code>True</code>. (It doesn't actually matter what value <code>tester</code> reports in this case; what's important is that it doesn't loop forever.)</p>
    <p>So whatever <code>halts?</code> reported must be wrong.  But it's never supposed to make mistakes. So the assumption that we can write <code>halts?</code> has to be wrong! Turing's "halting problem" has been proven to be impossible.</p>
        <p>This proof is of practical importance; because of it, nobody tries to write a perfect infinite loop checker. But that's not what mattered to Turing. He just used this example to prove something more general, namely, <strong>there are functions that can't be computed.</strong></p>
        <p>This isn't just a claim about the particular computers that existed in Turing's time, or today. Even when they invent magic quantum hyperspace computers (I have no idea what that phrase would even mean), they <em>still</em> won't be able to solve the halting problem.</p>
