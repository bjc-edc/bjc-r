        <h2>Creating a Computer Player</h2>
		<div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll make the computer play against the human player.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The game currently allows two human players to take turns playing. We need to make a way for the human player to take turns with a computer player that will take turns automatically. To simplify the project, we'll assume that the human player will always move first (playing X), and so the computer is playing O.</p>

						Benefits of using this kind of <em>abstraction</em> for this project:
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can read your code more easily as you prepare to add more pieces</li>
                            <li>You can use your custom block(s) for both the human <em>and</em> the computer players</li>

            First, we'll create two abstractions (<code>make player move</code> and <code>check for wins and ties</code>) using the code you already have so that:

                <li>You can use them to check for wins and ties for both players too.</li>

            <p>Brian, eh? Ethics and humor? ;) --MF, 6/8/18</p>

            Unlike people, all squares on the tic-tac-toe board are <em>not</em> created equal. Playing in the center (position 5) or on a corner (positions 1, 3, 7, or 9) is better than playing on an edge (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8).<br />
