        <h2>Creating a Computer Player</h2>
		<div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll make the computer play against the human player.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The game currently allows two human players to take turns playing. But you don't really need a computer to keep track of moves for two human players. We want the human player to take turns with a computer player that will move automatically. To simplify the project, we'll assume that the human player will always move first (playing X), and so the computer is playing O.</p>

I'm trying to justify why we are asking them to make custom blocks in a way that helps students understand abtraction and motivates them to use it in their own work. --MF, 6/8/18</p>
                        <p>Haven't we already told them to make <code>win?</code> and <code>tie?</code> blocks?  Those are the ones that will be used for both players.  "Implements each player's move" is a little vague, and will be (very) different for computer and human.  I think this should just be about <code>win?</code> and <code>tie?</code>.  --bh</p>

                  Benefits of using this kind of <em>abstraction</em> for this project:
                    <ul>
                      <li>You can read your code more easily as you prepare to add more blocks.</li>
                      <li>You can use your custom block(s) for both the human <em>and</em> the computer players.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </div>

            First, we'll create two abstractions (<code>make player move</code> and <code>check for wins and ties</code>) using the code you already have so that:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>You can read your code more easily,</li>
                <li>You can use these blocks to make the moves for both the human <em>and</em> the computer players, and</li>
                <li>You can use them to check for wins and ties for both players too.</li>

                    If you haven’t already, consolidate the code that implements each player's move into one abstraction. Create a <code>make player move</code> block, and use it to simplify your <code>when I am clicked</code> script.<br />

          We haven't done much with <code>broadcast</code> or clones, so I want to make sure these ideas are clear before we go on. --MF, 6/7/18
        </div>
		<p>For now, you'll create a computer player that moves to <em>random</em> positions on the board. (It won't be a very good player, but you'll fix that once the structure of the computer's-move code is in place.) Once the program decides where it wants to move, you'll use <code>broadcast</code> to send a message to tell the correct clone to record a move. (For the human player, <code>when I am clicked</code> serves this purpose, but the computer's moves aren't prompted by the user clicking a square.)</p>
        <div class="endnote">Recall that clones are temporary copies of a sprite. You learned about them in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-abstraction/4-building-Tic-Tac-Toe.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment#clones" title="Unit 2 Lab 4 Page 4: Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board">Unit 2 Lab 4 Page 4: Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board</a>.</div>

            Unlike people, all squares on the tic-tac-toe board are <em>not</em> created equal. Playing in the center (position 5) or on a corner (positions 1, 3, 7, or 9) is better than playing on an edge (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8).<br />
