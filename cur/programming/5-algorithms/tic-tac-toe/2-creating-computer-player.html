        <h2>Creating a Computer Player</h2>
		<div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll make the computer play against the human player.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The game currently allows two human players to take turns playing. But you don't really need a computer to keep track of moves for two human players. We want the human player to take turns with a computer player that will move automatically. To simplify the project, we'll assume that the human player will always move first (playing X), and so the computer is playing O.</p>
        <p>For now, you'll create a computer player that moves to <em>random</em> positions on the board. (It won't be a very good player, but you'll fix that once the structure of the computer's-move code is in place.) Once the program decides where it wants to move, you'll use <code>broadcast</code> to send a message to tell the correct clone to record a move. (For the human player, <code>when I am clicked</code> serves this purpose, but the computer's moves aren't prompted by the user clicking a square.)</p>
        <div class="endnote">Recall that clones are temporary copies of a sprite. You learned about them in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-abstraction/4-building-tic-tac-toe.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment#clones" title="Unit 2 Lab 4 Page 4: Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board">Unit 2 Lab 4 Page 4: Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board</a>.</div>

            <p><code>Broadcast</code> sends out a message to all the sprites in the project. Any scripts that start with <code>when I receive</code> with a matching message in the input slot will run.</p>
            <p>The <code>message</code> reporter reports the most recent message.</p>

		<p>Instead of having the computer move at random, you will start to give the computer some strategy. Unlike people, all squares on the tic-tac-toe board are <em>not</em> created equal. Playing in the center (position 5) or on a corner (positions 1, 3, 7, or 9) is better than playing on an edge (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8).<br />
