        <h2>Review Your Tic-Tac-Toe Project</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <h4><strong>NEXT YEAR</strong></h4>
            <p>I was looking for ways to scaffold this project without excessive hand-holding, and I decided to have them implement a randomly playing computer player first, then give it a little strategy (using the final "best empty square" rule), and then build in the advanced strategy later. As a result, <strong>this first lab doesn't have to wait until U5</strong>. For example, it might be nice to have it at the end of U3 or the beginning of U4 <em>before TCP</em> since that project uses <code>broadcast</code> and this first is easier to understand than that project. --MF, 6/7/18</p>
            <p>If we go with this approach <strong>next year</strong>, we need to update the link at the bottom of <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-tic-tac-toe/2-find-wins.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">3.2.2</a>. --MF, 6/8/18</p>

            <p><strong>In this lab</strong>, you'll extend your <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-tic-tac-toe/1-find-ties.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Tic-Tac-Toe program from Unit 3 program">Tic-Tac-Toe program from Unit 3 program</a> to make the computer play against you.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Open your <strong>U3L2-TicTacToe</strong> project, and save it as <strong>U5-TicTacToe</strong> so you'll still have your old version as a backup.</li>
                <li>
                    Play part of a game, stop before finishing, and then click on each of the following blocks. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Discuss what each expression does and how its code works.

                    Two of these blocks report what's on the board but in different ways: <code>status of all winning triples</code> and <code>board</code>. Why do you need both of those? When do you use each of them?
