        <h2>Review Your Tic-Tac-Toe Project</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>I was looking for ways to scaffold this project without excessive hand-holding, and I decided to have them implement a <strong>randomly playing computer player</strong> first, then give it a little strategy (using the final "best empty square" rule), and then build in the advanced strategy later. As a result, this first lab doesn't have to wait until U5. For example, it might be nice to have it at the end of U3 or the beginning of U4 <em>before TCP</em> since that project uses <code>broadcast</code> and this first is easier to understand than that project. --MF, 6/7/18</p>
            <p>If we go with this approach, we need to update the link at the bottom of <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-tic-tac-toe/2-find-wins.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">3.2.2</a>. --MF, 6/8/18</p>

                            I reordered this list to match the order in which they developed these blocks. I think that will make the process of remembering how they work smoother, but I'm interested to hear why they had been ordered this way, if there was a reason:

                            I'm finding "what algorithm it uses" to be somewhat vague. I'm not sure why. Maybe because "what one?" begs for "that one" whereas something like "how it works" asks for "like this." I see that that wouldn't work for a reporter, so I haven't changed it. Thoughts? Paul might have some... --MF, 6/4/18

                    Two of these blocks report what's on the board but in different ways: <code>status of all winning triples</code> and <code>board</code>. Why do you need both of those? When do you use each of them?
