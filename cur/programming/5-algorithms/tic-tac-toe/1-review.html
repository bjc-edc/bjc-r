        <h2>Review Your Tic-Tac-Toe Project</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <h4><strong>NEXT YEAR</strong></h4>
            <p>I was looking for ways to scaffold this project without excessive hand-holding, and I decided to have them implement a randomly playing computer player first, then give it a little strategy (using the final "best empty square" rule), and then build in the advanced strategy later. As a result, <strong>this first lab doesn't have to wait until U5</strong>. For example, it might be nice to have it at the end of U3 or the beginning of U4 <em>before TCP</em> since that project uses <code>broadcast</code> and this first is easier to understand than that project. --MF, 6/7/18</p>
            <p>If we go with this approach <strong>next year</strong>, we need to update the link at the bottom of <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-tic-tac-toe/2-find-wins.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">3.2.2</a>. --MF, 6/8/18</p>
            <p>For this year, the page needs to match the variable names currently in U2 and U3, so I've edited the page for that. <strong>Next year,</strong> we'll need to change that. --MF, 6/13/18</p>

            <p><strong>In this lab</strong>, you'll extend your <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-tic-tac-toe/1-find-ties.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Tic-Tac-Toe program from Unit 3 program">Tic-Tac-Toe program from Unit 3 program</a> to the computer play against you.</p>

                <div class="todo">
                    <p>The wording of "save it as FOO so you have a copy of
                    your old version" really bothers me.  It isn't right; it's the new version
                    that's a copy, not the old one.  This is actually important because it's
                    the new one they're going to edit.  I tried to fix it in 3.2.1 with this
                    wording: "Open your U2L4-TicTacToe project, and save it as U3L2-TicTacToe
                    so you'll still have your old version when you edit the new one."  That may
                    be too wordy.  I didn't change the others because there are a lot of them
                    in the whole curriculum and I got discouraged, and anyway you'll probably
                    disagree, and we should argue it out before I do anything drastic.</p>
                    <p><strong>BRIAN:</strong> How's this? --MF, 6/15/18</p>

                    Two of these blocks report what's on the board but in different ways: <code>status of all winning triples</code> and <code>board</code>. Why do you need both of those? When do you use each of them?
