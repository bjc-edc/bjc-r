            <p><strong>In this lab</strong>, you'll make the computer play against the human player <em>strategically</em>.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll define the strategy that the computer will use by investigating the strategies that humans use.</p>

        <p>You've already built into your project the most basic Tic-Tac-Toe strategy rule: the computer will move to the <code>best empty square</code> on its turn. But there are other important elements to a good strategy...</p>

But the best players develop additional rules that come after the first two but before the last. You can explore some of these rules in the Take It Further problems at the end of the lab.</div>
