        <h2>Making the Computer Play Strategically</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll implement the Tic-Tac-Toe strategy rules to make the computer play strategically.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>You'll set up a <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/next-move.png" alt="next move for computer" title="next move for computer"> block so you can broadcast to all the clones the position where the computer will move. As before, only the clone with the matching <var>position number</var> will make the move.</p>
        <p>
        	The code for <code>next move for computer</code> will implement the three strategy rules:
            <ul>
                <li>Rule 1: If I (the computer, player O) can win; do so.</li>
                <li>Rule 2: If my opponent (the human, player X) can win; block them.</li>
                <li>Final rule: Otherwise, just pick the best empty square.</li>
            </ul>
		</p>
        <div class="endnote">You will build the <code>next move for computer</code> block using two new blocks: <code>can player win now?</code> and <code>winning square for player</code>, which aren't written yet. To start building <code>next move for computer</code>, you'll make the other two blocks, but they won't really do anything. They'll just be for setting up the code for <code>next move for computer</code>, and you'll make them do what they're meant to later.</div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">

        <p>You can check <code>status of all winning triples</code> for a triple that will allow the computer player to win on the next turn, but you will not be able to tell the <em>position</em> of the square where that player will move. To make that possible, you will need to initialize the spaces in the <var>board</var> variable with the numbers 1 to 9 instead of nine copies of the word "Empty." Then <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/winning-square-for-player.png" alt="winning square for player" title="winning square for player" /> can select the position number out of the winning triple.</p>

                    TG Note: After changing the <var>board</var> initialization from nine instances of "Empty" to the numbers 1-9, students are likely to have two bugs:
                    <ul>
                        <li>One in the code that determines if there is a tie</li>
                        <li>Another in the <code>best empty square</code> block</li>
                    </ul>
                    In both cases, the bug is using "Empty" in the <code>contains</code> block and the solution is to use <code>is () a number?</code> instead.

        <p>Now you'll begin working on the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/winning-square-for-player.png" alt="winning square for player" title="winning square for player" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/can-player-win-now.png" alt="can player () win now?" title="can player () win now?" /> blocks. The <code>can player win now?</code> block can just check if there is a winning square by checking the results of <code>winning square for player</code>, so you'll code <code>winning square for player</code> first.</p>
        <p>You'll begin by building a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/winning-triple-for-player.png" alt="winning triple for player" title="winning triple for player" /> block to identify the contents of the three squares on the board where the player could win on their next turn.

                    TG Tip: Creating the <code>winning triple for player</code> and <code>winning square for player</code> blocks are the most challenging parts of this page. Help students prepare by making sure they:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Debug everything that comes before developing these blocks</li>
                        <li>Think through the approach they will take (as suggested on the page just before they begin building <code>winning triple for player</code>)</li>
                        <li>Consider building the suggested <code>opponent to</code> and <code>how many () in ()?</code> blocks</li>

So what you have to find is a <em>fork: </em>two triples in which you have one appearance and your opponent has none, and which have a free square in common.

But player X can find <em>two</em> winning combinations, the ones marked with the red lines, both of which have one X and two free squares, <em>with one of the free squares in common</em>.
