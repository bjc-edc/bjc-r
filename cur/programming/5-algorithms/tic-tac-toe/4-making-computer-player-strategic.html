        <h2>Making the Computer Play Strategically</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>PG: Long and hard.</p>
            <p>MF: Project still needs to be wrapped up and updated online</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll implement the Tic-Tac-Toe strategy rules to make the computer play strategically.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>You'll set up a <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/next-move.png" alt="next move for computer" title="next move for computer"> block so you can broadcast to all the clones the position where the computer will move. As before, only the clone with the matching <var>position number</var> will make the move.</p>
        <p>
        	The code for <code>next move for computer</code> will implement the three strategy rules:
            <ul>
                <li>Rule 1: If I (the computer, player O) can win; do so.</li>
                <li>Rule 2: If my opponent (the human, player X) can win; block them.</li>
                <li>Final rule: Otherwise, just pick the best empty square.</li>
            </ul>
		</p>
        <div class="endnote">You will build the <code>next move for computer</code> block using two new blocks: <code>can win now?</code> and <code>winning square</code>, which aren't written yet. To start building <code>next move for computer</code>, you'll make the other two blocks, but they won't really do anything. They'll just be for setting up the code for <code>next move for computer</code>, and you'll make them do what they're meant to later.</div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">

                    Create these two new blocks for implementing the strategy rules. <!--Use the same script-local variable name, <var>player</var> for the inputs.--> For now, make <code>can win now?</code> report <code>false</code> no matter what.

                        That way, the computer will skip rules 1 and 2 and just default to the final rule, and so you can continue using your program as you build and test these two new blocks.

        <p>You can check <code>status of all winning triples</code> for a triple that will allow the computer player to win on the next turn, but you will not be able to tell the <em>position</em> of the square where that player will move. To make that possible, you will need to initialize the spaces in the <var>board</var> variable with the numbers 1 to 9 instead of nine copies of the word "Empty." Then <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/winning-square-for-player.png" alt="winning square for player" title="winning square for player" /> can select the position number out of the winning triple.</p>

The <code>can win now?</code> block can just check if there is a winning square by checking the results of <code>winning square</code>, so you'll code <code>winning square</code> first.</p>
        <p>You'll begin by building a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/winning-triple-for-player.png" alt="winning triple for player" title="winning triple for player" /> block to identify the contents of the three squares on the board where the player could win on their next turn.

                            It's not good enough just to look for a winning move for yourself two moves from now. If you can see such a move, so can your opponent, who'll move to block you. So what you have to find is a <em>fork: </em>two triples in which you have one appearance and your opponent has none, and which have a free square in common. This is much easier to see with a picture:<br />

Player O had to respond in the bottom right corner in order to block an immediate win for player X. It's player X's turn. There is no winning combination with two Xs, nor with two Os. But player X can find <em>two</em> winning combinations, the ones marked with the red lines, both of which have one X and two free squares, <em>with one of the free squares in common</em>.
