		<h2>Sequential Languages</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will learn about other programming languages and how you can learn them by building on your skills with Snap<em>!</em> programming.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn about sequential programming languages and see that you can already kind of read them.</p>
        </div>

		<p>A programming language is characterized by two things: a philosophy of programming and details of notation. Most modern programming languages are <em>multi-paradigm</em> but basically <em>sequential</em>. This includes Snap<em>!,</em> even though you have learned some composition (nesting) of functions (known as functional programming) and some ideas about sprites as objects (object-oriented programming).</p>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth">
			<div class="sidenote">You learned about reporters and commands on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/4-making-a-new-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc/1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 1 Lab 2 Page 4: Making Your Own Block">Unit 1 Lab 2 Page 4: Making Your Own Block</a> and about predicates on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/1-variables-games/2-checking-player-guess.html?topic=nyc_bjc/2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 2 Lab 1 Page 2: Checking the Player's Guess">Unit 2 Lab 1 Page 2: Checking the Player's Guess</a>.</div>
			<p>
				<strong>Multi-paradigm</strong> languages take ideas from several different approaches to programming style. Here are a few approaches you have seen in Snap<em>!</em>:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Sequential</strong> programming, where operations are performed in order one at a time</li>
					<li><strong>Functional</strong> programming, where computation is achieved by composing functions (<em>reporter</em> and <em>predicate</em> blocks) inside each other rather than sequencing (i.e., ordering) <em>command</em> blocks</li>
					<li><strong>Object-Oriented</strong> programming, code is organized around objects (such as sprites), which may contain their own data or code, rather than around functions or sequenced instructions</li>
				</ul>
                <div class="todo">It would be nice to add some images showing short examples of each programming type. --MF 12/17/24</div>

			Learning another language of the same type is <em>much</em> easier than learning your first one. For example, here’s the binary search function from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms//1-searching-lists/3-spell-checker.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Lab 1</a> of this unit:<br />

                            <strong>Python uses makes all variables local automatically.</strong> In Python, there's nothing like the <code>script variables</code>  block.  Variables are automatically local (usable only within their procedures) and will only be global (usable anywhere in the program) if you use a <pre class="inline">global</pre> or <pre class="inline">nonlocal</pre> statement. <a href="#hint-python-whylocal" data-toggle="collapse" title="Why does Python have automatically local variables?">Why does Python do this?</a>

                                Automatically making variables all local encourages programmers to use global variables only when really necessary. You learned why global variables are sometimes necessary but otherwise best avoided on page <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/1-variables-games/4-keeping-score.html?topic=nyc_bjc/2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 2 Lab 1 Page 4: Keeping Score with Global Variables">Unit 2 Lab 1 Page 4: Keeping Score with Global Variables</a>. (If you need a review, you learned about the <code>script variables</code> block and local variables on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/1-variables-games/1-number-guessing-game.html?topic=nyc_bjc/2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 2 Lab 1 Page 1: Starting a Number Guessing Game">Unit 2 Lab 1 Page 1: Starting a Number Guessing Game</a>.)

                            <strong>Python uses indentation to organize code structure.</strong> Snap<em>!</em> uses <em>C-shaped blocks</em> (like the <code>repeat</code> block shown right) to control which instructions are part of a loop or conditional; Python uses indentation instead. <a href="#hint-python-cshape" data-toggle="collapse" title="See a comparison of C-shaped blocks vs. indentation.">See a comparison.</a>

                                Snap<em>!</em> gives a visual indicator of which instructions are and aren't part of a loop or conditional. The <em>C-shaped blocks</em> vividly clarifies the extent of the loop or conditional:<br />

                                Python uses indentation (how many spaces at the beginning of each line) for the same purpose:
                                <pre class="indent">if (current_item &gt; value):
    high = current_index-1</pre>
                                Python is unique among popular languages in making the amount of spacing significant in this way.

                        <li><strong>Python list numbering starts at 0 not 1.</strong> In Python, as in many text-based languages, the first item of a list is item number 0, not item 1. So for example, item 5 is actually the sixth item.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Python uses parentheses instead of nested reporters.</strong> Snap<em>!</em> lets you nest blocks inside each other to tell the computer the order in which you want to perform operations. In text-based languages like Python, you must use parentheses if your expression doesn't follow order of operations. <a href="#hint-python-parentheses" data-toggle="collapse" title="See an example of nesting vs. parentheses.">See an example.</a>

                                    <li>But <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/plus-first.png" alt="3*(4+5)" title="3*(4+5)" /> would need to be written as <pre class="inline">3*(4+5)</pre> in Python.</li>

                        <li><strong>Python doesn't allow spaces in variable names.</strong> So you can't have a variable like <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/current-item.png" alt="current item" title="current item" />.  Instead, Python programmers often use underscore characters ( _ ) inside variable names (such as in <pre class="inline">current_item</pre>). </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Python uses one equals sign to set a variable and two equals signs as a predicate.</strong> Like many text-based languages, in Python:
                            <ul>
                                <li>A single equals sign sets the value of a variable, such as <pre class="inline">x = 3</pre> instead of <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-empty.png" alt=" set () to ()" title="set () to ()" />.</li>
                                <li>Two equals signs checks for equality: <pre class="inline">x == 3</pre> instead of <img class="nopad" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/x-is-3.png" alt="(x) = (3)" title="(x) = (3)" />.</li>

                                The notation of using an equals sign to set a variable is the cause of many bugs, even among experienced programmers.

                                        This design choice is inherited indirectly from Fortran, a programming language invented back in the 1950s when computers could display only 64 different characters, so there were fewer options available.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript creates local variables differently.</strong> Inside a procedure, JavaScript's <pre class="inline">var</pre> statement is equivalent to <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/script-variables(a).png" alt="script variables (a)" title="script variables (a)" />.  There are better ways to create local variables in JavaScript, but they look different from Snap<em>!</em>.</li>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript uses braces to organize code structure.</strong> Braces <pre class="inline">{ }</pre>
                        mark the extent of what would be a C-shaped block in Snap<em>!</em>.  (Although JavaScript programmers do generally indent code more or less the same way Python programmers do, in JavaScript the indenting doesn't matter to the computer but is just to make it more readable to people.)
                            <div class="todo">
                                <p>I cut all of this because it's confusing. There are semicolons at the end of every line above. --MF 9/2/25</p> Within the braces, statements are separated by semicolons (<pre class="inline">;</pre>). (In JavaScript, semicolons go <em>between</em> statements: <pre class="inline">{statement; statement; statement}</pre>, but in the C programming language, which is otherwise quite similar, the semicolons go <em>after</em> statements: <pre class="inline">{statement; statement; statement<span style="background-color:orange">;</span>}</pre>.
                                <p>CUT FROM BEFORE: <br />This is the sort of thing that drives students of text languages crazy.  It's one of the advantages of block-based languages such as Snap<em>!</em>.</p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript calls everything functions (commands and reporters).</strong> JavaScript uses the name "function" to describe <em>all</em> procedures, including what Snap<em>!</em> calls "commands," the ones that don't report a value.</li>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript also doesn't allow spaces in variable names.</strong> Just as in Python, you can't have a space inside a variable name in JavaScript.  Instead, JavaScript programmers often use "camel case," so called because the capital letters in the middle of a variable name are supposed to look like the humps of a camel. For example, <pre class="inline">currentItem</pre> instead of <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/current-item.png" alt="current item" title="current item" />.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript also uses one equals sign to set a variable and two <em>or three</em> equals signs as a predicate.</strong> JavaScript, like Python, uses the <code>=</code> notation instead of <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-empty.png" alt=" set () to ()" title="set () to ()" />. But instead of using <pre class="inline">==</pre> to test whether two values are equal, JavaScript has <em>two</em> ways to do that: <pre class="inline">==</pre>, which is like <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/x-is-3.png" alt="(x) = (3)" title="(x) = (3)" />, and <pre class="inline">===</pre>, which is like <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/is-x-identical-to-3.png" alt="is (x) identical to (3)?" title="is (x) identical to (3)?" />. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Learning Another Sequential Language</h3>
		<p>There are things to learn about notation (<em>syntax,</em> which is the text-language equivalent of block colors and shapes). But you will be able to learn the details of one of these other languages <em>much</em> more quickly now because you've learned Snap<em>!</em>. You already know how to program in a sequential language!</p>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth">
			<p>The <strong>syntax</strong> of a language is the notation it uses (punctuation, words reserved for specific purposes, etc.).  Human languages have syntax, too: nouns vs. verbs, commas vs. semicolons, and so on.</p>
			<div class="todo"><p>The <strong>semantics</strong> of a language refers to the meaning or purpose of each piece of syntax.</p>I'm not sure why this was on the page. Semantics is not mentioned anywhere else and an irrelevant vocab term feels like an odd way to wrap up. --MF, 12/20/21</div>

        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page,</strong> you learned about sequential programming languages and saw how you can already somewhat read two other sequential programming languages (Python and JavaScript) even though you haven't learned their syntax.</div>
