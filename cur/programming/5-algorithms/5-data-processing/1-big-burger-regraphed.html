		<h2>Data Visualization</h2>

In Lab 2, you built a graphing app that can visualize data at different scales. This app can be used to visualize data in ways that communicate new information. New insights can be learned when working with data in iterative and interactive ways.

                <li>In  <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-gps-data/1-big-burger.html">Unit 4, Lab 2</a>,<div class="sidenote">Remember, GPS data lists latitude first, but latitude is vertical when graphed.</div> you analyzed GPS data for Big Burger, and changed the way you looked at the data to find clusters within it. Use your graphing app to re-examine the Big Burger data. Do you need to make any adjustments to <code>PlotPoint</code> or to <code>Graph datapoints</code>?</li>
				<li>How can you visualize just one of the three Big Burger clusters?</li>
				<li>For each cluster, find and plot the average of all the longitudes and latitudes of the cluster. Your work and blocks from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-gps-data/3-clustering.html">Unit 4, Lab 2</a> should be helpful!</li>

				<div class="todo"> Trying to hint at "big data" here. Wonder if kids will take note, but there are lots of other answers here -- qualitative or categorical data can't be graphed, missing or duplicated information causes havoc, etc. Could be a better phrasing.</div>
