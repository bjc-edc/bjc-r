		<h2>Building a Traffic Simulation</h2>
        <p>Have you ever been on a highway going really slowly in heavy traffic and all of a sudden the traffic begins to speed up for no apparent reason at all?  Nobody got off. You didn't pass an accident. Nothing seems to have changed except that now the cars are going faster.  What happened?</p>
        <p>In this lab, you will develop a model of what might affect traffic speed, and build a simulation in Snap<em>!</em> to explore that model.</p>

          <div class="endnote">
                To keep the model from being too complicated to program, here are some simplifying assumptions.
                <ul>
                   <li>There is a single lane of traffic and cars cannot pass each other.</li>
                   <li>The highway is straight, with no stoplights, speed-change signs, or obstacles.</li>
                   <li>Drivers change speed to fit the traffic.</li>
                  		<ul> 
                        	<li>If a car is too close to the car ahead of it, it slows down.</li>
                            <li>Drivers speed up whenever they can, up to the speed limit.</li> 
                        </ul>
                   <li>All cars behave the same. They speed up and slow down equally well.</li>
                   <li>Since the stage is not as wide as Arizona, and since it is a nuisance to create 100,000 cars (sprites), recycle cars as they leave the stage, starting the same car at the beginning of the stage.</li>
                   <li> You can decide...
                   		<ul> 
                        	<li>...how close is "too close" to the car in front;</li>
                            <li>...how a car speeds up and slows down;</li>
                            <li>...the speed limit;</li>
                            <li>...how many cars to put on the road;</li>
                       		
                		</ul>
                   </li>
                 </ul>
        	</div>
            <ol>
                	<li><strong>Analyze the <em>state</em> of one vehicle. What variables will it need? </strong>All cars will have the same rate of deceleration and acceleration, but that should be a variable so that we can experiment with it.  Each car will have its own speed. Each car is following one particular other car. What, if any, other variables must each car keep track of?</li>
                    <li><strong>Analyze the <em>behavior</em> of one vehicle: </strong> If a driver sees a car in front of it, the driver slows to the speed of that car. Otherwise, the driver speeds up. Distance to the car in front should probably matter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Design an algorithm for the behavior: </strong> Exactly <em>how</em> will the car's speed change depending on the distance to the car in front of it?</li>
                    <li><strong>Program your algorithm.</strong> Give one sprite the ability to detect its distance to the (not-yet-existent) sprite ahead of it, and the script that uses that to control its forward motion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clone your sprite</strong> to create enough cars for your simulation. </li>
                    <li><strong>Initialize: </strong> Set your cars out in some starting position, and give each car whatever other information it needs to start off.</li>
                    <li><strong>Test and refine your model:</strong> Do the cars keep moving? Do they avoid crashes as they should? Does traffic flow smoothly? Do you see changes in speed? Adjust your model, if necessary, so that it works.</li>
            </ol>
