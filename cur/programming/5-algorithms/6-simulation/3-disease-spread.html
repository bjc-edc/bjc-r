        <h2>Simulation Project: Disease Spread (Teacher's Choice)</h2>
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/img_disease-spread/diseaseSpread.png" height="250" alt="Disease Spread"/><br>

<p>In this project you will simulate the spread of a disease in a population. </p>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        <ol>
        <li>Play with the Snap<em>!</em> file <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=bjcsolutions&ProjectName=U5L6p3DiseaseSpread_Teacher&hideControls" target="_blank">linked here</a> to get a feel for the simulation program you will be writing.
        </li>
        <li>
        Here are some recommended steps to help you in your coding:<br>
        <ul>
        <li>Ask the user for the percentage of the population initially infected.</li>
        <li>Use the <code>create a clone of myself</code> block of Snap<em>!</em> to generate a population of 25 agents. (More than 25 will probably slow down the simulation)</li>
         <li>Make the input percentage of the population sick, make the rest healthy.</li>
         <li>Start a timer to measure the duration of the simulation.</li>
         <li>Have the agents move around with constant speed, bounce at the edges.</li>
         <li>When a healthy agent collides with a sick agent it also becomes sick.</li>
         <li>Stop the animations and the timer when the entire population becomes sick.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        Try your very best but if you get stuck, you can use <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/6-simulation/3b-disease-spread-hints.html" target="_blank">this page</a> for hints.

        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <ol type="A">
            
            <li>Study the relation between P, the percentage of the population initially sick and T, time elapsed until the entire population becomes sick.  Make chart of P versus T, in increments of 5% for P.  Divide labor in class as needed to build the chart.  To ensure reliability you may need to run each simulation several times and take the average.  Create a graph of your findings.  Do you see any patterns?</li>

	<li>Here are some variations on your simulation that make it more realistic.  Save a copy of your work and then implement one or more of these to see how your simulation changes:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduce vaccination at the start of simulation to a given percentage of the population.</li>
        <li>Give a probability to being infected when a healthy agent encounters a sick agent.</li>
        <li>Let the infected heal either with time or by a probability.</li>
        <li>Let the infected slow down in speed.</li>
        <li>Let those infected and then healed become immune to sickness.</li>
        <li>Introduce doctor agents that heal the sick upon encounter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Design and implement a Predator-Prey simulation.  What are some realistic factors you need to incorporate into your model so you can observe the dynamic fluctuations in the populations of predator and prey?</li>
