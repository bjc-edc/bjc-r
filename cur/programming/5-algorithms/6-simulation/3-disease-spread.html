        <h2>Simulation Project: Disease Spread (Teacher's Choice)</h2>

<p><span style="color:red">Suppose you are medical researcher at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and would like to understand the factors that contribute to the spreading of a new disease in various populations.  In particular, you would like to know the effect of population size on the speed at which the disease spreads.  What would be a sensible hypothesis on how population size relates to the speed of the spread of the disease?  You may not have enough data from actual outbreaks to make any meaningful conclusions, and, needless to say, it would be unethical induce the disease in various populations to gather new data. In this situation a simulation would be the best option to generate data in order to test your hypotheses without the constraints of time, cost and ethicacy. </span> In this project you will simulate the spread of a disease in a population. You will build the tools to explore the effects of variable parameters such as population size and pace of agent interaction on the spread of the disease.</p>

        <li>Play with the Snap<em>!</em> file <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=bjcsolutions&ProjectName=U5L6p3DiseaseSpread_Teacher&hideControls" target="_blank">linked here</a> to get a feel for the simulation program you will be writing.
        </li>
        <li>
        Here are some recommended steps to help you in your coding:<br>
        <ul>
        <li>Ask the user for the population size, percentage of the population initially infected and the speed at which the agents should be moving.</li>
        <li>Use the <code>create a clone of myself</code> block of Snap<em>!</em> to generate a population of size input by the user.
         <li>Make the user specified percentage of the population sick (red), make the rest of the population healthy (blue).</li>
         <li>Start a timer to measure the duration of the simulation.</li>
         <li>Have the agents move around with the constant speed input by the user, and have them bounce at the edges.</li>
         <li>When a healthy agent collides with a sick agent, it also becomes sick.</li>
         <li>Stop the animations and the timer when the entire population becomes sick.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        Try your very best but if you get stuck, you can use <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/6-simulation/3b-disease-spread-hints.html" target="_blank">this page</a> for hints.</li>
        <span style="color:red">
        <li>Discuss how your simulation may be similar to and different than a real life disease outbreak.  Identify the simplifying assumptions you had to make in this simulation.</li>
            <li>Study the relationships between the various variables in the simulation: N the population size, P the percentage of the population initially sick and v the speed at which the agents move, and T time elapsed until the entire population becomes sick.  For example:  <ul>
             <li>To understand the effect of population size, fix P=10 and v=3, and make a chart of N versus T, in increments of 10 for N.</li> 
             <li>To understand the effect of initial percentage of the sick, fix N=100 and v=3, and make a chart of P versus T, in increments of 10 for P.</li>  
             <li>To understand the effect of agent speed, fix N=100, P=10 and make a chart of v versus T, in increments of 1 for v.</li>
              </ul>
             In each of the cases above, have a hypothesis predicting the patterns that will emerge in the simulations.  Divide labor in class as needed to build the charts.  To ensure reliability you may need to run each particular simulation several times and take an average.  Create visual graphs of your findings.  Do you see any patterns?  Do they agree with your hypothesis?  What can be learned from these simulations?

	<li>Here are some variations on your simulation to make it more realistic.  Save a copy of your work and then implement one or more of these to see how your simulation changes:<br>
    <ul>
       
        <li>Give a probability to being infected when a healthy agent encounters a sick agent.</li>
        <li>Let the infected slow down in speed.</li>
        <li>Let the infected heal either with time or by a probability.</li>
        <li>Let those infected and then healed become immune to sickness.</li>
        <li>Introduce doctor agents that heal the sick upon encounter.</li>
        <li>Introduce vaccination at the start of simulation to a given percentage of the population.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Design and implement a Predator-Prey simulation in Snap<em>!</em>.  What are some parameters you need to incorporate into your model so you can simulate realistic fluctuations in the populations of predator and prey?</li>

<li>You are a technical advisor to a new bank that wants to make customer experience a top priority by minimizing customer wait times in queue. The bank is weighing in two alternatives: a single queue where the customers line up in arrival order and wait for the next available teller, or separate queues for each teller. The bank would like to use a computer simulation to assess these two alternatives to determine the average wait time for customers in each scenario.  Design and implement two simulations in Snap<em>!</em> like the following linked examples (<a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=bjcsolutions&ProjectName=U5L6SingleQueue_Teacher&hideControls" target="_blank">option 1</a>, <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=bjcsolutions&ProjectName=U5L6MultipleQueues_Teacher&hideControls" target="_blank">option 2</a>) to help the bank determine the best choice.<br>
