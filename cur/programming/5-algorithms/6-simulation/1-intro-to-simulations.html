Models and simulations are simplified representations of more complex objects or phenomena.  Models may use different abstractions or levels of abstraction depending on the objects or phenomena being posed.  Models often omit unnecessary features of the objects or phenomena that are being modeled. Models and simulations facilitate the formulation and refinement of hypotheses related to the objects or phenomena under consideration.  Hypotheses are formulated to explain the objects or phenomena being modeled.  Hypotheses are refined by examining the insights that models and simulations provide into the objects or phenomena. The results of simulations may generate new knowledge and new hypotheses related to the phenomena being modeled. Simulations allow hypotheses to be tested without the constraints of the real world.  Simulations can facilitate extensive and rapid testing of models.  The time required for simulations is impacted by the level of detail and quality of the models, and the software and hardware used for the simulation.  Rapid and extensive testing allows models to be changed to accurately reflect the objects or phenomena being modeled.<br>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first"><br>
As a class discuss and come up with some examples of complex real life phenomena for which it would be impractical, impossible or even unethical to conduct real world experiments.  Explain how modeling and simulations may help with our understanding of these phenomena.  What are the pros and cons of such an approach?
