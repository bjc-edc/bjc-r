        <h2>Simulation Project: Flipping a Coin (Teacher's Choice)</h2>

        <p>In this project you are going to simulate the flipping of a coin a given number of times.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        <ol>
        <li>Play with the Snap<em>!</em> file linked here to get a feel for what you are trying to achieve in the simulation.  Discuss the sequence of events in this simulation, starting from the interaction with the user about the number of flips, to the reporting of the tally of the “Heads”, “Tails” and the total.</li>
        
        <li>Based on your discussions, build a Snap<em>!</em> program to run the simulation.  Here is a student Snap<em>!</em> file linked here with a sprite named “Coin” with two costumes (“Heads” and “Tails”) and a sound file (“Pop”) to get you started in your work.  If you wish, you can instead upload your own costumes (for example to use foreign coins, etc.) and another sound.</li><br>
        If you get stuck, you can visit <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/6-simulation/2b-flipping-a-coin-hints.html" target="_blank">this page</a> for hints.
        </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <ol type="A">
            <li>Save a copy of your work and create code that simulates a biased coin.  For example, instead of the odds of “Heads” vs “Tails” being 50%-50%, the respective likelihoods could be 75%-25%.  You can ask the user for input for what this bias should be.</li>
            <li>
            Study the mathematics behind the tossing of a coin a number of times.  For example, in 3 tosses of a coin, what is the likelihood of getting: <br>
            (a) exactly 3 “Heads”, <br>
            (b) exactly 2 “Heads”, <br>
            (c) exactly 1 “Head”, <br>
            (d) no “Heads”<br>

			How would your answers change if the coin was biased?</li>

		<li>Create a Snap<em>!</em> program to simulate the rolling of three dice.  Create a variable to report the sum of the three dice.</li>
            
            <li>In games like “Dungeons and Dragons”, dice in the shape of “Platonic Solids” with various number of faces, are used.  Do some research on the “Platonic Solids” and model rolling such dice in Snap! </li>
            <li>
            Research about some simple but fun games you can have with coin flipping or dice rolling.  Model these game in Snap<em>!</em>
