        <p>In this project you are going to simulate the flipping of a coin a given number of times.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        <ol>
        <li>Play with the Snap<em>!</em> file linked here to get a feel for what you are trying to achieve in the simulation.  Discuss the sequence of events in this simulation, starting from the interaction with the user about the number of flips, to the reporting of the tally of the “Heads”, “Tails” and the total.</li>
        
        <li>Based on your discussions build a Snap<em>!</em> code to run the simulation.  Here is a student Snap<em>!</em> file linked here with a sprite named “Coin” with two costumes (“Heads” and “Tails”) and a sound file (“Pop”) to get you started in your work.  If you wish, you can instead upload your own costumes (for example to use foreign coins, etc.) and another sound.</li><br>
        If you get stuck you use this page for hints.
