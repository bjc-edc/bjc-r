        <h2>Simulation Project: Flipping a Coin (Teacher's Choice)</h2>

        <p style="color:red">If you toss a fair coin, you assume that the chances of getting a Head or a Tail are equal.  But you would be quite surprised if every time you tossed a coin 10 times, you always got exactly 5 Heads and 5 Tails.  What percent of the time do you get that result? Is it different if you tossed the coin 100 times? 1000 times?  It is tiresome and impractical to toss a coin hundreds or thousands of times but it is possible to explore these questions with a simulation.  In this project you will simulate the flipping of a coin and test your hypotheses on variety of questions.</p>

        <ol>
        <li>Play with  <span style="color:red">the Snap<em>!</em> file <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=bjcsolutions&ProjectName=U5L6p2CoinFlip_Teacher&hideControls" target="_blank">linked here</a> to get a feel </span>for what you are trying to achieve in the simulation.  Discuss the sequence of events in this simulation, starting from the interaction with the user about the number of flips, to the reporting of the tally of the Heads, Tails and the total.</li>
        
        <li>Based on your discussions, build a Snap<em>!</em> program to run the simulation.  Here is a student Snap<em>!</em> file  <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/U5L6-coinflip-student.xml" target="_blank">linked here</a> with a sprite named “Coin” with two costumes (Heads and Tails) and a sound file (“Pop”) to get you started in your work.  If you wish, you can instead upload your own costumes (for example to use foreign coins, etc.) and another sound.  Do your best but if you get stuck, you can visit <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/6-simulation/2b-flipping-a-coin-hints.html" target="_blank">this page</a> for hints.</li>
        
       <li style="color:red">When you toss a coin 10 times and repeat this trial many times, how do you think the percentage of Heads you get in each trial will be distributed?  As a class use your simulation to conduct the experiment of tossing a coin 10 times and record the percentage of Heads that is observed.  Combine your results as a class to graphically display the distribution of this percentage with a histogram.  Are the results in accordance with what you thought?</li>

<li style="color:red">If you were to repeat the above experiment but this time tossing the coin 100 times, how would you expect your results to change?  Test your hypothesis with your simulation. (To speed up the simulation, make sure that in your code the wait times between tosses is 0 secs)</li>

            <ol type="A">
            <li>Save a copy of your work and create code that simulates a biased coin.  For example, instead of the odds of Heads vs Tails being 50%-50%, the respective likelihoods could be 75%-25%.  You can ask the user for input for what this bias should be.</li>
            <li>
            Study the mathematics behind the tossing of a coin a number of times.  For example, in 3 tosses of a coin, what is the <span style="color:red">theoretical</span> likelihood of getting: <br>
            (a) exactly 3 “Heads”, <br>
            (b) exactly 2 “Heads”, <br>
            (c) exactly 1 “Head”, <br>
            (d) no “Heads”<br>

			How would your answers change if the coin was biased?</li>

		<li style="color:red">Create a Snap<em>!</em> program to simulate the rolling of three dice.  Create a variable to report the sum of the three dice.  Predict which sum will occur most often if you rolled the dice 1000 times.  Use your simulation to test your hypothesis.</li>
            
            <li>In games like “Dungeons and Dragons”, dice in the shape of “Platonic Solids” with various number of faces, are used.  Do some research on the “Platonic Solids” and model rolling such dice in Snap<em>!</em> . </li>
            <li>
            Research about some simple but fun games you can have with coin flipping or dice rolling.  Model these games in Snap<em>!</em> .
