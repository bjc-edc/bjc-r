<h2>Disease Spread Hints</h2>
<div class="forYouToDo">
You can use the student file <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/U5L6-disease-spread-student.xml" target="_blank">linked here</a> to get started. Here are some hints for one possible way to write the code:
<ol>
<li>Initialize the variables that will keep track of time and the number of infected.  Ask the user for the, population size, the percentage of the population initially infected and the speed at which the agents will be moving.<br>
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/img_disease-spread/Initialize.png" width="507" alt=""/></li>
<li>Use <code>create a clone of myself</code> block in Snap! to generate the population of size input by the user.<br>
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/img_disease-spread/WhenGreenFlag.png" width="249" alt=""/></li>
<li>Keep track of time until the entire population is infected.<br>
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/img_disease-spread/activateTimer.png" width="399"  alt=""/></li>
<li>Initialize the clones by giving them sick (red) or healthy (blue) costume. Assign sick costumes to clones until the user specified percentage of the population initially infected is reached. Give random direction and location to clones.
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/img_disease-spread/cloneInitialize.png" width="683"  alt=""/></li>
<li>Once the timing starts, clones will move until they hit an edge where they bounce.  If a healthy agent collides with a sick one, it will get sick.<br>
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/img_disease-spread/WhenIstartasaclone.png" width="440"  alt=""/></li>
<li>Detect collision with a sick agent. <br>  
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/img_disease-spread/collideWithSick.png" width="648"  alt=""/><br>
The collision detection code above may look needlessly complicated, as the <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/img_disease-spread/touchingColor.png"  height="36" alt=""/> block  already exists in the Sensing menu.
We create the <code>collideWithSick?</code> block as such because Snap<em>!</em> can be very slow in sensing touching by color but is very fast sensing touching by sprite.</li>

<li>Test your code to make sure that everything works as intended.</li>
</ol>
