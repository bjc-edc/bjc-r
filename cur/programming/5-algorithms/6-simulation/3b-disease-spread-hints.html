<h2>Disease Spread Hints</h2>
<div class="forYouToDo">
You can use the student file <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/U5L6-disease-spread-student.xml" target="_blank">linked here</a> to get started. Here are some hints for one possible way to write the code:
<ol>
<li>Initialize the variables that will keep track of time, number of infected, population total and speed at which the agents will be moving.  Ask the user for the percentage of the population initially infected.<br>
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/img_disease-spread/Initialize.png" width="507" alt=""/></li>
<li>Use <code>create a clone of myself</code> block in Snap! to generate the population.<br>

<li>Keep track of time until the entire population is infected.<br>

<li>Initialize the clones by giving them sick (red) or healthy (blue) costume. Assign sick costumes to clones until the percentage of the population initially infected -which was input by the user- is reached. Give random location and direction to clones.

<li>Clones will move until they hit an edge where they bounce.<br>

<li>Detect collisions between agents and if a healthy agent is colliding with a sick agent, switch the healthy to sick.  Make sure that you capture the correct red color when using the <code>touching -color- ?</code> block.

<li>Test your code to make sure that everything works as intended.</li>
