        <h2>Analyzing Data</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will ask and answer more demanding questions about your dataset and learn new tools.</p>

            You can ask questions about a specific subset of your data by <em>filtering</em> the data using <code>keep</code>. Filtering is a powerful technique for finding information and recognizing patterns in data. For example, filtering can help you answer questions like "What is the average city MPG <em>for just the Subarus</em> in this dataset?"<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/average-mpg-of-subarus-reporting.png" alt="average of (column (9) of table (keep items (field (14) of record 'empty list input slot' = Subaru) from (data of table (cars))) reporting 19.49..." title="average of (column (9) of table (keep items (field (14) of record 'empty list input slot' = Subaru) from (data of table (cars))) reporting 19.49..." /><br />
            Column 14 is the "Make" of the vehicle, so we <code>keep</code> all the records from <var>cars</var> for which the 14<sup>th</sup> field is "Subaru." Then, we take column 9 of those records (the "City MPG") and find their average.
        </p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p>Notice that there are many digits in the answer above.  How many digits are given in the table for each car's MPG?  An important rule in data science is not to claim more precision in a result than is warranted by the given data, so this answer should be rounded to 19.</p>
            <p>You might find expressions with many nested function calls easier to build by using the <code>pipe</code> function. <a href="#hint-pipe" data-toggle="collapse" title="What would this look like using pipe?">What would this look like using <code>pipe</code>?</a>
                <div id="hint-pipe" class="collapse">
                    <p>
                        You can use the <code>pipe</code> function from the "Bar Charts" library to work through your data analysis one function at at time:<br />
                       <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/pipe-cars-reporting.png" alt="pipe (data of table (cars)) → (keep items (field (14) of record 'list input slot' = Subaru) from 'list input slot') (column (9) of table ()) (average of ()) reporting 19.49..." title="pipe (data of table (cars)) → (keep items (field (14) of record 'list input slot' = Subaru) from 'list input slot') (column (9) of table ()) (average of ()) reporting 19.49..." /><br />
                        The <code>pipe</code> function sends the <code>data from table (</code><var>cars</var><code>)</code> through <code>keep</code> to filter it for just the Subarus, through <code>column (9) of table</code> to get just the "City MPG" for those Subarus, and finally through <code>average</code> to get the average of those Subaru MPG values.  
                    </p>
                    <p>Recall that the empty input slots in each function are filled by the output of the previous function (or the starting dataset in the case of the first function): the empty slots in the <code>keep</code> function are both filled by <code>data from table (</code><var>cars</var><code>)</code>; the empty slot in <code>column (9) of table</code> is filled by the output of <code>keep</code>; and the empty slot in <code>average</code> is filled by the output of <code>column (9) of table</code>. It's like a pipe of made of pieces connected together; the data goes in one end and works through each function, computing a new value at each step.</p>

            Sometimes, you want to keep a subset of your data (such as "Which cars were made in 2010?"), but other times, you just want one item that matches your requirement, often because what you really want to know is whether <em>any</em> items match, and as soon as you find one, the answer is &quot;yes&quot; (such as "Were any electric cars made in 2010?"). Snap<em>!</em> has a higher order function <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/find-first.png" alt="find first item () in 'list input slot'" title="find first item () in 'list input slot'" /> that works similarly to <code>keep</code>, but it reports only the first item that's found, so it can be faster. 
        </p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p><code>Find first</code> is a higher order function like <code>keep</code>, <code>map</code>, and <code>combine</code>, because it takes a function (a predicate) as input. (<code>Find first</code> is like <code>item (1) of (keep)</code>.)</p>
