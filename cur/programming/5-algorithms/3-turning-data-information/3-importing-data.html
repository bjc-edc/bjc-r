            <p>Brian, I'm definitely going to need some help thinking about how to cover the standards. I think most of DAT-2 goes here with the exception of DAT-2.B, which can go with what's currently 3.5.4. --MF, 6/7/19</p>

                        CSV stands for "comma separated values." CSV files are tables of data stored with commas between each item in a row and line breaks between each row in the table. (You can see the commas and line breaks of a CSV in a text editor.) Spreadsheets applications (such as Google Sheets, Apple Numbers, or Microsoft Excel) store data in different file formats (such as XLS or XLSX files, for example). CSV is an open file format that works in any of these applications and in Snap<em>!</em>.

				<li>Open Snap<em>!</em> and drag the downloaded file into the Snap<em>!</em> window. You should see a table full of data. Look over the data (including the <em>column headings</em> in the top row) to give yourself a sense of what kind of information is included. Then click "OK" to close the window. You can still see the data in the watcher on the Snap<em>!</em> stage.</li>
                <li>Experiment with different inputs to the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/item-empty-full-size.png" alt="item () of 'list input slot'" title="item () of 'list input slot'" /> block to access different rows in the dataset.</li>

        <p>Each row in your dataset is one <em>record</em>. For example, a single record might be the data for one student in your school, the data for one earthquake that happened, the data for one hospital in the U.S, or the data for one contact in your contact list.</p>

        <h3>Filterting Data</h3>
        <p>
            You can ask questions about a specific subset of your data by <em>filtering</em> the data using <code>keep</code>. For example, "What the average city MPG <em>for just the Subarus</em> in this dataset?"<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/average-mpg-of-subarus-reporting.png" alt="average of (column (1) of table (keep items such that (item (12) of () = Subaru) from (cars))) reporting 19.49..." title="average of (column (1) of table (keep items such that (item (12) of () = Subaru) from (cars))) reporting 19.49..." /><br />
            <div class="comment">Include a link to wherever U3 math tools ends up for the <code>average</code> block import. --MF, 6/7/19</div>
            Column 12 is the "Make" of the vehicle, so we <code>keep</code> all the items from <var>cars</var> where the 12<sup>th</sup> item is Subaru. Then, we take column 1 of that (the "City MPG") and take the average of those values.
        </p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p>Notice that there are many digits in the answer above.  How many digits are in each car's MPG?  An important rule in data science is not to claim more precision in a result than is warranted by the given data, so this answer should be rounded to 19.</p>
            <p>You might find expressions with many nested function calls easier to build by using <code>pipe</code>, which you learned in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-making-computers-do-math/1-math-predicates.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 2 Lab 4 Page 1: Mathematical Predicates">Unit 2 Lab 4 Page 1: Mathematical Predicates</a>. </p>

                <a href="#hint-pipe" data-toggle="collapse" title="">What would this look like using <code>pipe</code>?</a>
                <div id="hint-pipe" class="collapse">
                    <p>
                        You can use the <code>pipe</code> function from the "Frequency Distribution Analysis" library to work through your data analysis one function at at time:<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/pipe-cars-reporting.png" alt="pipe () → (keep items such that (item 12 of () = Subaru) from ()) (column (1) of table ()) (average of ()) reporting 19.49..." title="pipe () → (keep items such that (item 12 of () = Subaru) from ()) (column (1) of table ()) (average of ()) reporting 19.49..." /><br />
                        The <code>pipe</code> function sends the <var>cars</var> data through <code>keep</code> to filter it for just the Subarus, through <code>column (1) of table</code> to get just the "City MPG" for those Subarus, and finally through <code>average</code> to get the average of those Subaru MPG values.  
                    </p>
                    <p>Recall that the empty input slots in each function are filled by the output of the previous function (or the starting dataset in the case of the first function): the empty slots in the <code>keep</code> function are both filled by <var>cars</var>; the empty slot in <code>column (1) of table</code> is filled by the output of <code>keep</code>; and the empty slot in <code>average</code> is filled by the output of <code>column (1) of table</code>. It's like a pipe of made of pieces connected together; the data goes in one end and works through each function, computing a new value at each step.</p>

        <h3>Grouping Data</h3>
        <p>
            Another thing that's often done in data science is <em>grouping</em> data. For example, here is the <var>cars</var> data grouped by vehicle make (column 12):<br />
            <div class="comment">image needs alt-title text --MF, 6/26/19</div>

            <ul>
                <li>Column A shows all of the vehicle makes.</li>
                <li>Column B shows the total number of vehicles of each make.</li>
                <li>Column C contains a list of all the data from <var>cars</var> for the vehicles of that Make (such as all the data for the Toyotas or all the data for the Saabs). If you double-click one of the lists in column C, another table will open showing the data for all cars of that make. </li>
            </ul>  
        </p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">

                            <p><code>Pipe</code> may be useful for questions that require looking inside the inner lists of the grouped data (in column C).</p>

        <h3>Plotting Data</h3>
        <p>
            You can also... For example, with and without pipe...<br />

        <h3>Asking Questions Across Columns</h3>
        <p>E.g., Which vehicle make has the fewest cars in this database? (You'd need <code>minimum</code>.)</p>

        <div class="todo">I'm wondering about offering the kids the video or part of it on the page or in the TIF (the teachers should definitely see it). --MF, 6/26/19</div>

				<li><code>sort</code> (TIF because it's hard to understand how/why to set up the predicate</li>
                <li>constructing new list a.k.a. inserting a column with <code>map</code> (TIF because this is complicated to think about)</li>
