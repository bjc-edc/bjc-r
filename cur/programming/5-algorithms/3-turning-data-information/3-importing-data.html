            You may be familiar with tables from spreadsheet applications (such as Google Sheets, Apple Numbers, or Microsoft Excel) which store tabular data in different file formats. Spreadsheets help efficiently organize information, and they can find trends in data automatically (such as the line shown at right). CSV is an open spreadsheet format that works in any of these applications and in Snap<em>!</em>.

                CSV stands for "comma separated values." CSV files are tables of data stored with commas between each item in a row and line breaks between each row in the table. (You can see the commas and line breaks of a CSV by opening it in a text editor.)

        <h3>Challenges in Collecting Data</h3>
        
        <div class="comment">DAT-2.C.3, DAT-2.C.2 all bullets</div>
        <p>Researchers often face challenges with data before they even begin analysis. Suppose you are combining data from different countries about distances between cities, and you discover that the distance data from the U.S. is measured in miles, but the distance data from Europe is measured in kilometers; to make meaningful comparisons, you need <em>uniform</em> data (all in miles or all in kilometers). As another example, if you use an online survey to collect data, the way participants abbreviate, spell, or capitalize their entries may vary. Data may also be incomplete (if some people didn't complete the survey) or invalid (if some people made mistakes).</p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
            <div class="comment">DAT-2.C.4, DAT-2.E.2</div>
            <p><strong>Cleaning data</strong> is the process of making the data uniform <em>without changing its meaning</em> (such as replacing abbreviations, spellings, and capitalizations with the intended word or converting miles to kilometers). Programmers can use programs to filter and clean digital data, thereby gaining insight and knowledge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="comment">DAT-2.C.5</div>
        <p>Imagine you read in the news that people who eat a lot of broccoli are less likely to get cancer. The conclusion that broccoli prevents cancer could be a result of <em>bias</em>. It could be that people who eat a lot of broccoli tend to be the same people who also get a lot of exercise, and it's actually the exercise that makes the difference. In research, the term "bias" doesn't have to mean prejudice; it's about reasons the data might not mean what they seem to mean.</p>
        <p>People sometimes think that the way to overcome bias is to use a bigger sample (asking more people if they eat broccoli and have cancer). But if the bigger sample has the same problem (people getting more exercise also eat more broccoli), then a bigger sample won't eliminate the bias.</p>
