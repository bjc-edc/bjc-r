            <p>Brian, I'm definitely going to need some help thinking about how to cover the standards. I think most of DAT-2 goes here with the exception of DAT-2.B, which can go with what's currently 3.5.4. --MF, 6/7/19</p>

                        CSV stands for "comma separated values." CSV files are tables of data stored with commas between each item in a row and line breaks between each row in the table. (You can see the commas and line breaks of a CSV in a text editor.) Spreadsheets applications (such as Google Sheets, Apple Numbers, or Microsoft Excel) store data in different file formats (such as XLS or XLSX files, for example). CSV is an open file format that works in any of these applications and in Snap<em>!</em>.

You can still see the data in the watcher on the Snap<em>!</em> stage.</li>
                <li>Experiment with different inputs to the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/item-empty-full-size.png" alt="item () of 'list input slot'" title="item () of 'list input slot'" /> block to access different rows in the dataset.</li>

            Column 12 is the "Make" of the vehicle, so we <code>keep</code> all the items from <var>cars</var> where the 12<sup>th</sup> item is Subaru. Then, we take column 1 of that (the "City MPG") and take the average of those values.

                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/pipe-cars-reporting.png" alt="pipe (data of table (cars)) → (keep items (field (12) of record 'list input slot' = Subaru) from 'list input slot') (column (1) of table ()) (average of ()) reporting 19.49..." title="pipe (data of table (cars)) → (keep items (field (12) of record 'list input slot' = Subaru) from 'list input slot') (column (1) of table ()) (average of ()) reporting 19.49..." /><br />
                        The <code>pipe</code> function sends the <code>data from table(</code><var>cars</var><code>)</code> through <code>keep</code> to filter it for just the Subarus, through <code>column (1) of table</code> to get just the "City MPG" for those Subarus, and finally through <code>average</code> to get the average of those Subaru MPG values.  
                    </p>
                    <p>Recall that the empty input slots in each function are filled by the output of the previous function (or the starting dataset in the case of the first function): the empty slots in the <code>keep</code> function are both filled by <code>data from table(</code><var>cars</var><code>)</code>; the empty slot in <code>column (1) of table</code> is filled by the output of <code>keep</code>; and the empty slot in <code>average</code> is filled by the output of <code>column (1) of table</code>. It's like a pipe of made of pieces connected together; the data goes in one end and works through each function, computing a new value at each step.</p>

            Sometimes, you want to keep a selection of your data (such as "Which cars were made in 2010?"), but other times, you just want one item that matches your requirement (such as "What's a car that was made in 2010?"). Snap<em>!</em> has a higher order function, <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/find-first.png" alt="find first item () in 'list input slot'" title="find first item () in 'list input slot'" /> that works similarly to <code>keep</code>, but it reports only the first item that's found.

        <h3>Grouping Data</h3>
        <p>

            <ul>
                <li>Column A shows all of the vehicle makes.</li>
                <li>Column B shows the total number of vehicles of each make.</li>
                <li>Column C contains a list of all the data from <var>cars</var> for the vehicles of that Make (such as all the data for the Acuras or all the data for the Nissans). If you double-click one of the lists in column C, another table will open showing the data for all cars of that make. </li>

        <h3>Plotting Data</h3>
        <p>
            <div class="comment">image needs alt/title text. --MF, 6/27/19</div>
            The <code>histogram</code> function works like the <code>group</code> function, except that it allows you to specify the upper and lower boundaries of the data you are grouping by and the size of the groupings, and it sorts the data by grouping. For example, here is the <var>cars</var> data grouped by MPG (column 1):<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/histogram-by-mpg.png" alt="" title="" />
            <ul>
                <li>Now, Column A shows MPG grouped and sorted into intervals of 5.</li>
                <li>As before, Column B shows the total number of vehicles with each MPG range (0&ndash;5, 5&ndash;10, 10&ndash;15, etc.)</li>
                <li>As before, Column C contains a list of all the data from cars with that MPG range (such as all the data for the 268 cars that get between 20 and 25 MPG in the city).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p><code>Histogram</code> is a higher order function like <code>keep</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>combine</code>, <code>find first</code>, and <code>group</code> because it takes functions (here, both <code>field</code> and <code>+5</code>) as input.</p>

        <h3>Asking Questions Across Columns</h3>
        <p>E.g., Which vehicle make has the fewest cars in this database? (You'd need <code>minimum</code>.)</p>
