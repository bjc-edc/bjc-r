            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data</strong> are the values that computers receive from various sources, including human activity, sensors, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Information</strong> is the humanly-useful patterns extracted from data.</li>

        <p>The given data let us answer some questions but not others.  We can, for example, answer questions about how patterns of fertility and life expectancy differ from one continent to another, but not questions about how life expectancy is affected by the jobs people do, because the data displayed doesn't show jobs.</p>

                    In any given year, the graph has a downward slope. That is, countries with a higher fertility rate have a lower life expectancy. This kind of relationship is called a <em>correlation</em>. What (if anything) does that tell you about the relationship between fertility rates and life expectancy?

                        A <strong>correlation</strong> is a dependence between two variables in a situation. For example here, as one variable goes up the other goes down. It's also a correlation when as one variable goes up or down the other may changes in the same manner.

        <p>The data by themselves don't tell you what causes what. There may be a correlation between two things, but this does not mean one thing causes the other. People often say, "Correlation does not imply causation" Additional research is needed to understand the exact nature of the relationship.</p>
        <p>Often, a single source does not contain the data needed to draw a conclusion. It may be necessary to combine data from a variety of sources to formulate a conclusion.</p>
