        <p>Large data sets can be overwhelming to analyze, but software tools can help people extract information, identify trends, make connections, and solve problems with data. Software programs, such as the graph below from Google can allow you to process data interactively to gain insight and knowledge.</p>
        <div class="todo">I think these have to go somewhere around here:<br />
            DAT-2.E.1: Programs are used in an iterative and interactive way when processing information to allow users to gain insight and knowledge about data.<br />
            <s>DAT-2.E.2: Programmers can use programs to filter and clean digital data, thereby gaining insight and knowledge.</s><br />
            DAT-2.E.3: Combining data sources, <s>clustering data, and classifying data</s> are parts of the process of using programs to gain insight and knowledge from data.<br />
            <s>DAT-2.E.4: Insight and knowledge can be obtained from translating and transforming digitally represented information.</s><br />

        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Data</strong> vs. <strong>Information</strong>
            <div class="comment">DAT-2.A.1</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data</strong> are the values that computers receive from various sources, including human activity, sensors, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Information</strong> is the humanly-useful patterns extracted from data.</li>

        </div>
    
        <p>The data given in the graph above let us answer some questions but not others.  We can, for example, answer questions about how patterns of fertility and life expectancy differ from one continent to another, but not questions about how life expectancy is affected by the jobs people do, because the data displayed doesn't show jobs.</p>

                    <div class="comment">DAT-2.E.5</div>
                    In any given year, the graph has a downward slope. That is, countries with a higher fertility rate have a lower life expectancy. This kind of relationship is called a <em>correlation</em>. What (if anything) does that tell you about the relationship between fertility rates and life expectancy? This pattern in the data becomes obvious looking at the picture, but it would not have been obvious just looking at the data.

                        A <strong>correlation</strong> is a particular kind of information, namely a dependence between two variables in a situation. For example in the first picture here, as one variable goes up the other goes down. It's also a correlation when as one variable goes up or down the other changes in the same manner.

        <p>The data by themselves don't tell you what causes what. There may be a correlation between two things, but this does not mean one thing causes the other. People often say, "Correlation does not imply causation." Additional research is needed to gain <em>insight</em> into the exact nature of the relationship, such as causation.</p>

        <div class="todo">DAT-2.E.3, DAT-2.E.1</div>
        <p>Often, a single source does not contain the data needed to draw a conclusion; it may be necessary to combine data from a variety of sources. As you found using visualization software with the fertility and life expectancy data, sometimes a pattern you discover in one data set can just raise another question for research such as, "Are either of these things correlated with median income in the country?" To answer this question, you could find an economic database, download some data, and use look for additional correlations. There can be several cycles of seeing something in the data and collecting more data to examine before you have what seems like a reliable insight about causation.</p>
