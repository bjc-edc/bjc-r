        	<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will learn how data visualization can help people understand data.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Large data sets can be overwhelming to analyze, but software tools can help people extract information, identify trends, make connections, and solve problems with data. Software programs, such as the graph below from Google can allow you to process data interactively to gain insight and knowledge.</p>

                        <li>Move the slider to 1960 (all the way to the left), and describe the meaning of the cluster of orange data points in the lower right. What does this tell you about trends in about this region of the world at that time?</li>
                        <li>Move the slider to 2016 (all the way to the right), and describe the meaning of the cluster of pink data points in the upper left. What does this tell you about trends in about this region of the world at that time?</li>

        <p>In ordinary speech, the words "data" and "information" are used interchangeably. But in computing, these words have specific technical meanings.</p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Data</strong> vs. <strong>Information</strong>
            <div class="ap-standard">DAT-2.A.1</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data</strong> are the values that computers receive from various sources, including human activity, sensors, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Information</strong> is the humanly-useful patterns extracted from data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><div class="ap-standard">DAT-2.A.2</div>Data provide opportunities for identifying trends, making connections, and addressing problems. Information is the result of analyzing that data.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The data given in the graph above let us answer some questions but not others.  We can, for example, answer questions about how patterns of fertility and life expectancy differ from one continent to another, but not questions about how life expectancy is affected by the jobs people do, because the data displayed doesn't show jobs.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
                <li>
                    <div class="ap-standard">DAT-2.E.5</div>
                    In any given year, the graph has a downward slope. That is, countries with a higher fertility rate have a lower life expectancy. This kind of relationship is called a <em>correlation</em>. What (if anything) does that tell you about the relationship between fertility rates and life expectancy? This pattern in the data becomes obvious looking at the picture, but it would not have been obvious just looking at the data.

                <div class="vocabFullWidth">
                    <p>
                        A <strong>correlation</strong> is a particular kind of information, namely a dependence between two variables. For example in the first picture here, as one variable goes up the other goes down. It's also a correlation when as one variable goes up or down the other changes in the same manner.

        <p>The data by themselves don't tell you what causes what. There may be a correlation between two things, but this does not mean one thing causes the other. People often say, "Correlation does not imply causation." Additional research is needed to gain <em>insight</em> into the exact nature of the relationship, such as causation.</p>

        <div class="ap-standard">DAT-2.E.3, DAT-2.E.1</div>
        <p>Often, a single source does not contain the data needed to draw a conclusion; it may be necessary to combine data from a variety of sources. As you found using visualization software with the fertility and life expectancy data, sometimes a pattern you discover in one data set can just raise another question for research such as, "Are either of these things correlated with median income in the country?" To answer this question, you could find an economic database, download some data, and use look for additional correlations. There can be several cycles of seeing something in the data and collecting more data to examine before you have what seems like a reliable insight about causation.</p>
