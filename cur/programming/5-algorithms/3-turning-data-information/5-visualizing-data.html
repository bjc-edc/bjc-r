            </div>
            Another thing that's often done in data science is <em>grouping</em> (or <em>classifying</em>) data. For example, here is the <var>cars</var> data grouped by vehicle make (column 14):<br />

src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/group-data-of-cars-reporting.png" alt="group (data of table (cars)) by field (14) by intervals of ( )) reporting a table with three columns; column A contains each make of car from the original data set; column B shows the total number of cars in the original data set that are of that make; column C shows a picture of a list in each row of the table." title="group (data of table (cars)) by field (14) by intervals of ( )) reporting a table with three columns; column A contains each make of car from the original data set; column B shows the total number of cars in the original data set that are of that make; column C shows a picture of a list in each row of the table." /><br />
            <ul>
                <li>Column A shows all of the vehicle makes (field 14 of each record).</li>
                <li>Column B shows the total number of vehicles of each make.</li>
                <li>Column C contains a list of all the data from <var>cars</var> for the vehicles of that Make (such as all the data for the Acuras or all the data for the Nissans). If you double-click one of the lists in column C, another table will open showing the data for all cars of that make. </li>
            </ul>  
        </p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p>The <code>by intervals of</code> input to <code>group</code> should be left empty when, as in this example, the field on which you're grouping is text rather than numbers. Later on this page you'll see how to use intervals in graphing.</p>

        <h3>Plotting Data</h3>
        <p>
            <div class="comment">image needs alt/title text. --MF, 6/27/19</div>
            The <code>bar chart</code> function works like the <code>group</code> function, but with special features for numeric data: it allows you to select upper and lower limits of the data; you can have a range of values in one bucket, such as values 6&ndash;10, values 11&ndash;15, and so on; and it sorts the groups. For example, here is the <var>cars</var> data grouped by city MPG (column 9):<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/histogram-by-mpg.png" alt="" title="" />
            <ul>
                <li>Now, Column A shows city MPG (field 9 of each record) grouped into intervals of 5 and sorted.</li>
                <li>As before, Column B shows the total number of vehicles within each MPG range (0&ndash;5, 6&ndash;10, 11&ndash;15, etc.)</li>
                <li>As before, Column C contains a list of all the data from cars within that MPG range (such as all the data for the 879 cars that get between 21 and 25 MPG in the city).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p>The number in column A is the <em>largest</em> value included in each group.  If the values aren't all integers, the next group includes anything larger.  For example, the group numbered 15 includes values from 10.0001 (or anything more than 10) to exactly 15.</p>
        </div>
        <p>You can plot the data from <code>bar chart</code> to visualize them:
