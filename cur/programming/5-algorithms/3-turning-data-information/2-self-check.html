        <p>The size of a data set affects the amount of information that can be extracted from it. The datasets you work with in this course are small compared to the "big data" used to look at trends in Internet searches, environmental research, or financial technology. Large data sets (billions or trillions of entries) are difficult to process using a single computer and may require parallel computing across multiple systems; scalability becomes an issue because the computational capacity of a system can impact how data sets can be processed and stored.</p>

                            Scientists studying birds often attach tracking tags to migrating birds. For each bird, the following data is collected regularly at frequent intervals:
