		<title>Lab 7: Copyrights and Patents</title>

    	<h2>Copyright</h2>
    	<p>Well, at least when authors make up stories, <em>those</em> have to be unique strokes of genius, right? There weren't bunches of writers in the 1990s all writing stories about a nerdy boy whose relatives hate him but who turns out to be a great wizard, who goes to a school for wizards in a magic place that non-wizards can't find, right?</p>
    	<p>Well, actually, yes, even earlier than the 1990s. For example, consider the <a href="http://www.ursulakleguin.com/Index-Earthsea.html" target="new">Earthsea</a> books by Ursula K. LeGuin, written 30 years earlier. The two sets of books are quite different in their details, storyline, and purposes, but they do share the similarities in the paragraph above. (If you liked Harry Potter and haven't read the Earthsea books, consider doing so.) There have been many, many retellings of stories from Shakespeare, who himself took story ideas from earlier writers. </p>
    	<p>That's why copyrights are different from patents. Patents cover a broad idea. If I have a patent on the telephone, you can't sell a device for carrying on conversations over long distances, even if it works entirely differently from the one I built. If cell phones had been invented during the actual telephone patent's years of validity, only AT&amp;T, Bell's company, would have been allowed to manufacture and sell them.</p>
    	<p>But copyrights protect only the <em>actual words</em> of a particular writer&mdash;or the actual notes of the music, or whatever is covered by a copyright. It's perfectly okay for you to write a story about wizardry students, as long as they aren't actually named Harry, Hermione, and so on, and they don't have adventures exactly like the ones in the Harry Potter books.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Don't try to be too lawyerish about this.  You can't get around copyright by translating the words into Spanish, or Pig Latin, or whatever.  If what you write clearly came from what the copyright holder wrote, you're in trouble.</div>
    	<p>(The same line of reasoning, by the way, also explains something you may have found arbitrary: that your teachers complain of cheating if you copy and paste Wikipedia articles into your paper, but are happy if you reword differently what Wikipedia says. It's the words, not the ideas, that have to be your own.) </p>
