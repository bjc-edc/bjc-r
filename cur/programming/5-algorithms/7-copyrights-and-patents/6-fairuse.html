    	<h2>Fair Use</h2>
    	<p>Copyright protection is not absolute. Various kinds of &quot;fair use&quot; are allowed by US and most other countries' copyright laws. Here are some examples of fair use:</p>
<ul><li>You can, of course, copy anything if you get permission from the copyright holder.</li>
<li>You can
	quote a short excerpt from someone else's work for purposes of reviewing the original. The definition of &quot;short&quot; is complicated and is different for different works. You might be able to use an entire page of a long novel, but in the picture books written for very young children, a page would be a significant fraction of the entire work, and would not be allowed.
It took several lawsuits to settle whether the hip-hop technique of<em> sampling</em> older music was legal.  (The answer: Generally not, unless permission is given by both the recording artists and the song writers.)</li>
<li>Titles are not copyrightable at all. You can write a song and call it &quot;She Loves You,&quot; as long as the song itself is different from the Beatles' version.</li>
<li>You can copy newspaper articles for use in teaching a class if the event reported in the article was not anticipated when you planned your class and you don't keep using the same article year after year. This is why our &quot;Computing in the News&quot; is legal, even if your teacher passes out copies of actual news articles. (This kind of fair use may also apply to material that isn't brand new like a news article, but it's harder to make the argument that you couldn't have anticipated the need for it when planning your course.)</li>
  <li>You can produce a <em>parody</em> of a copyrighted work.  The most famous case of this kind is the 2001 novel <em>The Wind Done Gone,</em> by Alice Randall.  It retells the story of Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel <em>Gone with the Wind,</em> which concerns a wealthy slaveowner from the pre-Civil-War South named Scarlett O'Hara.  The Randall novel retells the same story, but in the voice of one of Scarlett's slaves, Cynara.  Mitchell's estate sued Randall and her publisher for copyright violation, but Randall claimed fair use under the parody rule.  After an appeals court overturned a ruling against Randall, the case was eventually settled after the publisher, Houghton Mifflin, donated part of the profits to the historically-Black Morehouse College.</li></ul>
