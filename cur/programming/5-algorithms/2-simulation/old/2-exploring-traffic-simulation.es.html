    <ol>
        <li>Observe your model, discuss with others, and come up with some hypotheses. What variables might affect the behavior you see?</li>

    <ol type="A">
        <li>What refinements might you add to your model?  Does it matter if, for example, drivers do <em>not</em> all speed up the same amounts, or if they slow down more quickly than they need to? </li>
        <li>Try inventing a different kind of simulation. For example, a field of randomly moving people, one of whom has the flu and can spread it to another if the two people are close enough. Does the spread of the disease depend on the number of people in the space? The speed they are moving? The distance between them that is needed to spread the disease? If a sick person gets better after a period of time, and cannot get sick again (has built immunity to that flu), how long does it take for the epidemic to pass and be gone completely?</li>
