        <h2>Flipping a Coin Project Hints</h2>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            Here are some hints for one possible way to write the code:
            <ol>
                <li>Create variables <var>Heads</var>, <var>Tails</var>, <var>Total</var> to keep track of the number of heads, tails and total tosses, and initialize these variables.</li>
                <li>Create a custom <code>TossCoin</code> block that simulates a coin being tossed (by rapidly switching between the "Heads" and "Tails" costumes a few times before randomly settling on a choice), and updates the variables accordingly.</li>
                <li>Ask the user how many times they wish to toss the coin, and repeat the simulation that many times.</li>
                <li>Play the "Pop" sound that signals the end of a flip.</li>
                <li>Add a brief pause between each toss so the user can see what's happening. (But make sure to eliminate this pause when simulating 100's of coin tosses.)</li>
            </ol>
