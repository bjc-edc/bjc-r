        <h2>Why Use Models and Simulations?</h2>
        <div class="todo">"Models" is no longer in the standards and has been subsumed in the simulations standards. Brian and Mary agreed to rename this "Why Use Simulations?" --MF, 3/6/19</div>

            <p>PG: General note: We say "As a classâ€¦" in FYTD 1 and "Explain" in FYTD 2. Classroom management should be up to the teacher, not us. And here, because our two directions are different, there's even an implication that the management should be different.  Throughout, we should pose the intellectual problem, but not micromanage the hand or mouth moves of the students, or tell students what their teachers should be doing.  We can suggest in the TG, and for the teachers who don't read the TG (most?), they'll do what they want and it'll be just like the teachers who do read the TG, who will also do what they want.</p>
            <p>BH: I'm unenthusiastic about this whole lab, but there's nothing really terrible about it. This page is really boring.  It needs an activity!</p>
            <p>MF: lightly clean up to make the text more concise</p>

            <p><strong>Simulations</strong> are computer representations of real things or situations that vary over time.</p>

            There are many reasons to use computer simulations rather than real-world experiments. Experimenting in the real world may be:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expensive</strong>, such as testing a proposed new airplane that might fall apart in strong winds. A simulation of the airplane and wind can eliminate some bad designs before building and testing a real airplane.</li>
                <li><strong>Time-consuming</strong>, such as testing the effects of a genetic mutation in a species across generations.</li>
                <li><strong>Dangerous</strong>, such as testing whether a nuclear reactor will survive an earthquake.</li>
                <li><strong>Unethical</strong>, such as giving a population a disease to test how fast it spreads.</li>
        	</ul>
        </p>
        <div class="comment">AAP-3.F.1, AAP-3.F.4</div>
        <p>Computer simulations rarely capture the full complexity of real situations. For example, simulations of global climate change should account for hundreds of interconnected factors such as wind patterns, the course of rivers, geological fault lines that cause earthquakes, and interactions of local plants and animals. However, because of limitations in computer speed, researchers leave out details to make simulations practical.</p>
        <div class="comment">AAP-3.F.5</div>
        <p>There are risks in making simplifications. For example, there might be an interaction between elements of the real situation that isn't obvious but turns out to be crucial. A simplification might lose the details that would have shown that interaction. Another issue is that if you have ideas in mind about what's going on, you are more likely to  emphasize details&mdash;even unconsciously&mdash;that support your ideas. (This kind of distortion is so common that researchers have a name for it: <em>confirmation bias</em>.)</p>

                <li>As a class, come up with some examples of complex real-life phenomena for which it would be impractical, impossible, dangerous, or unethical to conduct real-world experiments.</li>
                <li>Explain how simulations may help with our understanding of these phenomena. What are some pros and cons of using computers to explore these situations?</li>
