        <p>Suppose you are a medical researcher at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and would like to understand the factors that contribute to the spreading of a new disease across a population. In particular, you would like to know the effect of population size on the rate at which the disease spreads.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
            	<li>What would be a sensible hypothesis on how population size relates to the rate of the spread of the disease?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>You may not have enough data from actual outbreaks to test your hypothesis and make any meaningful conclusions, and it would be unethical to induce the disease in some population in order to gather new data. In this situation, a simulation would be the best option to generate data in order to test your hypotheses without the constraints of time, cost, and ethics.</p>
        <p>In this project, you will simulate the spread of a disease within a small population and explore the effects of variables such as population size and speed of human interaction on the spread of disease.</p>

                        <li>Make the user-specified percentage of the population sick and the rest of the population healthy.</li>
                        <li>Have a timer measure the duration of the outbreak (until everyone is infected).</li>

        <p>This is a simplified model. There are many things you could do to make the model more realistic. For example, you could make the infected people heal over time, or you could add doctor sprites who can heal sick sprites. But if you included <em>all</em> the things that happen in real human populations in your simulation, it would slow down the simulation too much to use. Updating your software or upgrading your hardware may help you include more details in your simulation, but you will always have to make some simplifications.</p>
        <div class="endnote">There was a time when weather scientists could do a good job of predicting the weather with a complicated model. The only problem was that the computers back then took several days to run the model, so the predictions weren't ready in time. Computers these days can run many complicated weather models fast enough to predict the weather reasonably well.</div>

                    Here are some possible variations on this simulation that could make it more realistic. Save a copy of your work before exploring one or more of these variations:<br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>Give a probability to being infected when a healthy person encounters a sick person.</li>

                        <li>Let the infected people heal either with time or by a probability.</li>
                        <li>Let those infected and then healed become immune to the sickness.</li>
                        <li>Introduce doctor sprites that heal the sick upon encounter.</li>
                        <li>At the start of simulation, introduce vaccination to a given percentage of the population.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Design and implement a predator-prey simulation in Snap<em>!</em>. For example, you could model an environment with wolf and deer populations where the wolf prey on the deer. What are some parameters you need to incorporate into your model so you can simulate realistic fluctuations in the populations of predator and prey?</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>a single line where the customers stand in arrival order and wait for the next available teller, or</li>
                        <li>separate lines for each teller. </li>
                    </ul>
