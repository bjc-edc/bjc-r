        <p>Suppose you are a medical researcher and would like to understand the factors that contribute to the spread of disease. In particular, you want to know the effect of population size on the time it takes for everyone to be infected, under the simplifying assumption that once infected, a person stays infected.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>You may not have enough data to test your hypothesis, and it would be unethical to induce the disease in a population just to gather new data. A simulation would allow you to test your hypotheses without the constraints of time, cost, and ethics.</p>

		<p>You want to know the effect of population size on the time elapsed. Because there is some randomness in the simulation, you are going to get some variation in the reported time. (This isn't a bug; in real life, random events affect the elapsed time.)</p>

					Write a function that takes population size as input, runs the simulation ten times, keeps the percent initially infected at 10 and the speed of infection at 2, and reports the average time elapsed.<br />

                <div class="sidenoteBig">Using clones is a form of parallelism. But as you learned on the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/8-sequential.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 5 Lab 1 Page 8: Parallelism">Unit 5 Lab 1 Page 8: Parallelism</a>, because the clones are all running on one processor, cloning doesn't give you any speedup.</div>
				<li>Call this function four times with different populations (50, 100, 150, and 200), and write down the results. Create a refined hypothesis about the relationship between population size and time for the entire population to be infected.</li>

        <p>This is a simplified model. There are many things you could do to make the model more realistic. For example, you could make the infected people get better over time or some people could be prevented from getting sick because, but you will always have to make some simplifications.</p>

                <li>Now conduct a similar experiment holding population size constant and varying the percent initially infected. Come up with a hypothesis for this relationship.</li>
                <li>Then conduct an other experiment by varying movement speed and keeping population size and percent initially infected constant, and create a third hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Add some more inputs to the simulation block. We've suggested people getting better after time or getting healed by doctors, but there are many more you could think of.</li>
                <li>You have hypotheses for changing only one variable, but what if you change two things? Do they affect the result independently, or is there a cross effect (for example, if sick people heal quickly, does that change the relationship between population size and time elapsed)? Run experiments to find out.</li>
                <li>Design and implement a predator-prey simulation in Snap<em>!</em>. For example, you could model an environment with wolf and deer populations where the wolf prey on the deer. What are some parameters you need to incorporate into your model so you can simulate realistic fluctuations in the populations of predator and prey?</li>

                    Imagine you work at a bank that wants to minimize customer wait times in line. The bank is considering two alternatives: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>a single line where the customers stand in arrival order and wait for the next available teller, or</li>
                        <li>separate lines for each teller. </li>
                    </ul>
                    Design and implement two simulations in Snap<em>!</em> to help the bank determine the <em>average wait time</em> for customers in each scenario in order to choose the best option.<br />
