            <p>PG: SCRAP. What I really mean is change, but major change. Again, what we're seeing is how clever someone else can be. Learning to model is different. The first few pages of DHH's Calculus text does a great job if building an intellectual model that could be programmed in Snap. Weather could be ok, but I think the disease spread might be easier to understand and model. I'd keep the /idea/ here, but stop trying to show off /our/ projects and instead teach a kid how to model.</p>

            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will model the spread of a disease in a population.</p>

        <p>Suppose you are a medical researcher at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and would like to understand the factors that contribute to the spread of a new disease. In particular, you want to know the effect of population size on the time it takes for everyone to be infected.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">

            	<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> What would be a sensible hypothesis on how population size affects the elapsed time?</li>
                <li>What if the space the people lived in (in the simulation, the size of the Snap<em>!</em> stage) was twice as big?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>You may not have enough data from actual outbreaks to test your hypothesis and make any meaningful conclusions, and it would be unethical to induce the disease in a population just to gather new data. In this situation, a simulation would be the best option to generate data to test your hypotheses without the constraints of time, cost, and ethics.</p>
        <p>In this project, you will simulate the spread of a disease within a small population and explore the effects of variables such as population size and speed of human interaction on the spread of disease.</p>

                    <div class="comment">AAP-3.F.8</div>
                    You want to know the effect of population size on the time elapsed. Because there is some randomness in the simulation, you are going to get some variation in the reported time. (This isn't a bug; in real life, random events affect the elapsed time.) Write a function in Snap<em>!</em> that runs the simulation 10 times while keeping the percent initially infected at 10 and the speed of infection at 2, and reports the average time elapsed.<br />

                <li>In real disease scenarios, not everyone ends up getting sick. How would you decide if the simplifications you used in a simulation invalidate the conclusions you might draw?</li>

        <p>This is a simplified model. There are many things you could do to make the model more realistic. For example, you could make the infected people heal over time, or you could add doctor sprites who can heal sick sprites, but you will always have to make some simplifications.</p>

                <li>Then conduct an other experiment by varying movement speed and keeping population size and percent initially infected constant, and create a third hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Add some more inputs to the simulation block. We've suggested people getting better after time or getting healed by doctors, but there are many more you could think of.</li>
                <li>You have hypotheses for changing only one variable, but what if you change two things? Do they affect the result independently, or is there a cross effect (for example, if sick people heal quickly, does that change the relationship between population size and time elapsed)? Run experiments to find out.</li>
                <li>Design and implement a predator-prey simulation in Snap<em>!</em>. For example, you could model an environment with wolf and deer populations where the wolf prey on the deer. What are some parameters you need to incorporate into your model so you can simulate realistic fluctuations in the populations of predator and prey?</li>

                    Imagine you work at a bank that wants to minimize customer wait times in line. The bank is considering two alternatives:

                        <li>a single line where the customers stand in arrival order and wait for the next available teller, or</li>
