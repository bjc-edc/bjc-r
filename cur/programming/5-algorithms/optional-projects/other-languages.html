		<h2>Transitioning to Other Languages</h2>
		<div class="learn"><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn about other programming languages and which will be easier for you to learn now that you know Snap<em>!</em>.</div>

		<p>A programming language is characterized by two things: a philosophy of programming and details of notation. Most programming languages are basically <em>sequential</em> (do this instruction, then do this, then do this). This includes Snap<em>!</em> even though you have learned some composition (nesting) of functions, which other sequential languages also include to some extent.</p>
		<p>Learning another language of that type is basically trivial. For example, here’s the same algorithm in Snap<em>!</em>, Python, C, and JavaScript:
			<div class="todo">Brian to choose an algorithm, have Mary review the choice, and then translate into other languages. --MF, 6/27/21</div>
		</p>
		<p>You can see that the notations are different and that there are things to learn about punctuation a.k.a. <em>syntax</em> (which is the text-language-equivalent of colors and shapes). But you would be able to learn the details of one of these other languages in a few focused days and then program in that language too.</p>
	
		<h3>How Are These Similar Languages Different from Snap<em>!</em>?</h3>
		<div class="todo">Brian to design:
			<ul>
				<li>Correlation between 4 languages in a table</li>
				<li>Differences: what makes the languages different from each other is stuff like in a sequence of n statements are there n semicolons or n-1 semicolons.</li>
				<li>Categories of syntax errors</li>
				<li>Libraries: What makes Python so popular is it’s enormous collection of libraries, which add vocabularies (words you have to learn)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3>How Can You Learn These Similar Languages?</h3>
		<div class="todo">
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp" title="W3Schools C++ Tutorial" target="_blank">W3Schools C++ Tutorial</a> &leftarrow; Brian, is C++ the right thing (not C); are you OK with promoting the W3Schools tutorials? Is there anything else you suggest that we promote also/instead? --MF, 6/27/21</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/" title="W3Schools Python Tutorial" target="_blank">W3Schools Python Tutorial</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/" title="W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial" target="_blank">W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3>How Are Other Languages So Different?</h3>
		<div class="todo">Brian to flesh out:
			<p>
				Here are some languages that really are different…
				<ul>
					<li>In LISP, all procedures are reporters, and you can have a sequence of them, but they all return values, and that's not just a notational difference.</li>
					<li>In SmallTalk, when you say 2 + 3, what you are doing is sending the message <pre class="inline">+ 3</pre> to the object to. In Snap that would be like doing something like <code>ASK (2) FOR (() + 3)</code>.</li>
				</ul>
