		<h2>Transitioning to Other Languages</h2>
		<div class="learn"><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn about other programming languages and how to learn them, now that you know Snap<em>!</em>.</div>

		<p>A programming language is characterized by two things: a philosophy of programming and details of notation. Most programming languages are basically <em>sequential</em> (do this instruction, then do this, then do this). This includes Snap<em>!,</em> even though you have learned some composition (nesting) of functions, which other sequential languages also include to some extent.</p>
		<p>Learning another language of the same type is <em>much</em> easier than learning your first one. For example, here’s the binary search function from 5.1.3:
		</p>
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/binary-search-block-definition.png" alt="binary search for (value) in (data) {
            script variables (low) (high) (current index) (current item)
            set (low) to (1)
            set (high) to (length of (data))
            repeat until ((low) > (high)) {
                        set (current index) to (average of (low) and (high)) #comment: find the middle word
                        set (current item) to (item (current index) of (data))
                        if ((current item) = (value)) { report (true) }
                        else {
                                    if ((current item) > (value)) #comment: eliminate half the list {
                                                set (high) to ((current index) – (1))
                                    } else { set (low) to ((current index) + (1)) }
                        }
            }
            report (false)
}" title="binary search for (value) in (data) {
            script variables (low) (high) (current index) (current item)
            set (low) to (1)
            set (high) to (length of (data))
            repeat until ((low) > (high)) {
                        set (current index) to (average of (low) and (high)) #comment: find the middle word
                        set (current item) to (item (current index) of (data))
                        if ((current item) = (value)) { report (true) }
                        else {
                                    if ((current item) > (value)) #comment: eliminate half the list {
                                                set (high) to ((current index) – (1))
                                    } else { set (low) to ((current index) + (1)) }
                        }
            }
            report (false)
}" />

		<p>Here's the same procedure written in Python:</p>
		<pre>
def binarySearch(value, data):
    low = 0
    high = len(data)-1
    while (low <= high):
        currentIndex = average(low, high)
        currentItem = data[currentIndex]
        if (currentItem == value):
            return True
        elif (currentItem > value):
            high = currentIndex-1
        else:
            low = currentIndex+1
    return False
</pre>
		<p>For the most part, this is line for line the same as the Snap<em>!</em> version.
		Apart from tiny details such as <code>return</code> instead of
		<code>report</code>, there are a few more significant differences in notation:
			<ul>
				<li>
					The most annoying one: Like many (but not all!)
					text-based languages, Python uses the character <code>=</code>
					to set the value of a variable, like the <code>set</code>
					block in Snap<em>!</em>.  But that's not what "=" means!  The Python equivalent of the Snap<em>!</em>
					<code>=</code> predicate is <code>==</code>.  Many, many bugs,
					even among experienced programmers, come from this confusing
					notation.  And it's needlessly hard to make sense of programming
					when you're confronted with a statement such as <code>x=x+1</code>.
				</li>
				<li>
					In Python, there's nothing like the
					<code>script variables</code> block in Snap<em>!</em>.
					Variables are local to procedures automatically, unless you
					use a <code>global</code> statement to tell Python to look for
					a variable defined outside this procedure.
				</li>
				<li>
					Python uses indentation (how many spaces at the beginning of each line) to determine the extent of control structures
					that would be C-shaped blocks in Snap<em>!</em>.
				</li>
				<li>
					As in many (but not all!) text-based languages, the first item of
					a list is item number zero, not item one.  They have a reason
					for this, but it's still confusing: Shouldn't the 27th item of
					a list be item number 27?
				</li>
				<li>
					In Python, you can't have a
					space inside a variable name, like <var>current item</var> in
					Snap<em>!</em>.  Instead, Python programmers often use
					"camel case," so called because the capital letters in
					the middle of a variable name are supposed to look like
					the humps of a camel.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>Here's the same procedure written in JavaScript:</p>
		<pre>
function binarySearch(value, data) {
    var low, high, currentIndex, currentItem;
    low = 0;
    high = len(data)-1;
    while (low <= high) {
        currentIndex = average(low, high);
        currentItem = data[currentIndex];
        if (currentItem == value) {
            return true;
        } else if (currentItem > value) {
            high = currentIndex-1;
        } else {
            low = currentIndex+1;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
</pre>

	<p>This doesn't look so different from the Python version, but there
	are a few significant differences:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			The <code>var</code> statement is equivalent to
			<code>script variables</code> in Snap<em>!</em>.
		</li>
		<li>
			JavaScript uses braces <code>{ }</code> to mark the extent
			of what would be a C-shaped block in Snap<em>!</em>.  Although
			JavaScript programmers generally indent code more or less the
			same way Python programmers do, that's just to make it
			more readable <em>to people;</em> the indentation is ignored by JavaScript.
			Within the braces, statements are separated by semicolons (<code>;</code>).
			(In JavaScript, semicolons go <em>between</em> statements:
			<code>{st;st;st}</code>, but in C, an otherwise similar language,
			they go <em>after</em> statements: <code>{st;st;st<span style="background-color:orange">;</span>}</code>.
			This is the sort of thing that drives students of text languages
			crazy.  It's one of the reasons block-based languages such as
			Snap<em>!</em> are better.)
		</li>
		<li>
			JavaScript has the same terrible <code>=</code> notation for
			Snap<em>!</em>'s <code>set</code> as Python does.
			But instead of using <code>==</code> to test whether two
			values are equal, JavaScript has <em>two</em> ways to do that:
			<code>==</code> and <code>===</code>.  (That looks like a joke,
			but alas, it isn't.)  JavaScript programmers
			often get confused about which is which.  (The one with three
			equal signs is similar to the <code>is identical to</code>
			block in Snap<em>!</em>.)
		</li>
		<li>
			JavaScript uses the name "function" to describe all procedures,
			including what Snap<em>!</em> calls "commands," the ones that
			don't report a value.
		</li>
	</ul>

		<p>You can see that there are things to learn about notation (<em>syntax,</em> which is the text-language equivalent of block colors and shapes). But you would be able to learn the details of one of these other languages in a few focused days and then program in that language, too.</p>
	
		<h3>Snap<em>!</em> Primitives in Other Languages</h3>
		<p>
			Central programming language features having to do with flow of control
			(<img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/Control.png" alt="Control" title="Control" />),
			data management
			(<img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/Variables.png" alt="Variables" title="Variables" />

			</table>

			<p>This is just a small sample of the number of primitive commands
			and functions in any programming language.  Luckily, you don't have
			to memorize all of them; you can do a web search for "javascript
			list item," for example, to learn any particular one as you need
			it.</p>

			<p>The other block categories, the ones having to do with graphics
			or sound, don't really have analogs in other languages.  Instead,
			just as Snap<em>!</em> has libraries, other languages also have
			libraries to provide such capabilities.  For example, if you want
			JavaScript equivalents to the turtle graphics blocks
			(<code>move (n) steps</code>, etc.), you start in your search
			engine; "JavaScript turtle graphics" will get you to
			<a href="https://github.com/bjpop/js-turtle">https://github.com/bjpop/js-turtle</a>
			from which you can download the file "turtle.js" to include with
			your own JavaScript program.</p>

			<p>Libraries are a little easier in Python because there's a
			central repository of them.  So you can draw a square this way:</p>

<pre>from turtle import *

pendown()
for i in range (1, 4):
    forward(100)
    right(90)
</pre>

		<h3>How Can You Learn These Similar Languages?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp" title="W3Schools C++ Tutorial" target="_blank">W3Schools C++ Tutorial</a> &leftarrow; Brian, is C++ the right thing (not C); are you OK with promoting the W3Schools tutorials? Is there anything else you suggest that we promote also/instead? --MF, 6/27/21</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/" title="W3Schools Python Tutorial" target="_blank">W3Schools Python Tutorial</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/" title="W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial" target="_blank">W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial</a></li>
			</ul>

			I didn't do any of this.  W3schools is a little controversial.
			Some people swear by them; others say they're full of inaccuracies.
			I don't know enough to have an opinion.  But, anyway, kids know
			how to learn stuff; you search the Web, or you get a book from
			the library.  Or you take APCSA next year.
