		<h2>Transitioning to Other Languages</h2>
		<div class="learn"><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn about other programming languages and how to learn them now that you know Snap<em>!</em>.</div>

		<p>A programming language is characterized by two things: a philosophy of programming and details of notation. Most programming languages are basically <em>sequential</em> (do this instruction, then do this, then do this). This includes Snap<em>!</em> even though you have learned some composition (nesting) of functions, which other sequential languages also include to some extent.</p>
		<p>Learning another language of that type is <em>much</em> easier than learning your first one. For example, here’s the binary search function from 5.1.3:

                                                set (high) to ((current index) – (1))
                                    } else { set (low) to ((current index) + (1)) }
                        }
            }
            report (false)
}" title="binary search for (value) in (data) {
            script variables (low) (high) (current index) (current item)
            set (low) to (1)

                        }
            }
            report (false)
}" />

		<p>Here's the same procedure written in Python:</p>
		<pre>
def binarySearch(value, data):
	low = 0
	high = len(data)-1
	while (low <= high):
		currentIndex = average(low, high)
		currentItem = data[currentIndex]
		if (currentItem == value):
			return True
		elif (currentItem > value):
			high = currentIndex-1
		else:
			low = currentIndex+1
	return False
</pre>
		<p>For the most part, this is line for line the same as the Snap<em>!</em> version.
		Apart from tiny details such as <code>return</code> instead of
		<code>report</code>, there are a few more significant differences in notation:
			<ul>
				<li>
					The most annoying one: Like many (but not all!)
					text-based languages, Python uses the character <code>=</code>
					to set the value of a variable, like the <code>set</code>
					block in Snap<em>!</em>.  But that's not what "=" means in
					your math class!  The Python equivalent of the Snap<em>!</em>
					<code>=</code> predicate is <code>==</code>.  Many, many bugs,
					even among experienced programmers, come from this confusing
					notation.  And it's needlessly hard to learn to program
					when you're confronted with a statement such as <code>x=x+1</code>.
				</li>
				<li>
					In Python, there's nothing like the
					<code>script variables</code> block in Snap<em>!</em>.
					Variables are local to procedures automatically, unless you
					use a <code>global</code> statement to tell Python to look for
					a variable defined outside this procedure.
				</li>
				<li>
					Python uses indentation to determine the extent of control structures
					that would be C-shaped blocks in Snap<em>!</em>.
				</li>
				<li>
					As in many (but not all!) text-based languages, the first item of
					a list is item number zero, not item one.  They have a reason
					for this, but it's still confusing: Shouldn't the 27th item of
					a list be item number 27?
				</li>
				<li>
					In Python, you can't have a
					space inside a variable name, like <var>current item</var> in
					Snap<em>!</em>.  Instead, Python programmers often use
					"camel case," so called because the capital letters in
					the middle of a variable name are supposed to look like
					the humps of a camel.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>Here's the same procedure written in JavaScript:</p>
		<pre>
function binarySearch(value, data) {
	var low, high, currentIndex, currentItem;
	low = 0;
	high = len(data)-1;
	while (low <= high) {
		currentIndex = average(low, high);
		currentItem = data[currentIndex];
		if (currentItem == value) {
			return true;
		} else if (currentItem > value) {
			high = currentIndex-1;
		} else {
			low = currentIndex+1;
		}
	return false;
}
</pre>

	<p>This doesn't look so different from the Python version, but there
	are a few significant differences:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			The <code>var</code> statement is equivalent to
			<code>script variables</code> in Snap<em>!</em>.
		</li>
		<li>
			JavaScript uses braces <code>{ }</code> to mark the extent
			of what would be a C-shaped block in Snap<em>!</em>.  Although
			JavaScript programmers generally indent code more or less the
			same way Python programmers do, that's just to make it look
			more readable to people; the indentation is ignored by JavaScript.
		</li>
		<li>
			JavaScript has the same terrible <code>=</code> notation for
			what Snap<em>!</em> calls <code>set</code> as Python does.
			But instead of using <code>==</code> to test whether two
			values are equal, JavaScript has <em>two</em> ways to do that:
			<code>==</code> and <code>===</code>.  JavaScript programmers
			often get confused about which is which.  (The one with three
			equal signs is similar to the <code>is identical to</code>
			block in Snap<em>!</em>.)
		</li>
		<li>
			JavaScript uses the name "function" to describe all procedures,
			including what Snap<em>!</em> calls "commands," the ones that
			don't report a value.
		</li>
	</ul>

		<p>You can see that the notations are different and that there are things to learn about punctuation a.k.a. <em>syntax</em> (which is the text-language-equivalent of colors and shapes). But you would be able to learn the details of one of these other languages in a few focused days and then program in that language too.</p>
	
		<h3>How Are These Similar Languages Different from Snap<em>!</em>?</h3>
		<div class="todo">Brian to design:
			<ul>
				<li>Correlation between 4 languages in a table</li>
				<li>Differences: what makes the languages different from each other is stuff like in a sequence of n statements are there n semicolons or n-1 semicolons.</li>
				<li>Categories of syntax errors</li>
				<li>Libraries: What makes Python so popular is it’s enormous collection of libraries, which add vocabularies (words you have to learn)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3>How Are Other Languages So Different?</h3>
		<div class="todo">Brian to flesh out:
			<p>
				Here are some languages that really are different…
				<ul>
					<li>In LISP, all procedures are reporters, and you can have a sequence of them, but they all return values, and that's not just a notational difference.</li>
					<li>In SmallTalk, when you say 2 + 3, what you are doing is sending the message <pre class="inline">+ 3</pre> to the object to. In Snap that would be like doing something like <code>ASK (2) FOR (() + 3)</code>.</li>
				</ul>
