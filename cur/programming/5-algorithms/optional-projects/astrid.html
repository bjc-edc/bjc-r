<strong>Why do this?</strong> To give the students a chance to apply their skills of developing algorithms and using abtractions in the context of a visual arts project.  To motivate students with interest in arts and to give them an opportunity to synthesize their artistic skills with their knowledge of algorithms and coding.<br />
<strong>Why here?</strong>  At this point in the curriculum the students know enough to be able to complete a computational visual art project with minimal hand-holding.

<h2>Astrid Design</h2>
<div class="learn">
In this project you will create a design called "Astrid" and explore its variations.<br />

<ol>
<li>With your partner discuss how the Astrid is created.  Develop an <em>algorithm</em> that will generate the first quadrant of the design and then use <em>abstraction</em> to extend the design to the other quadrants.


</li>

                        
                    
<li>Write a Snap<em>!</em> program to generate the Astrid design.

                        There are many possible approaches to this problem.  One approach could use the <code>for</code> block.

Using the same principles, create a surrounding frame for your Astrid, as shown below in the middle. The oval region created by the surrounding frame looks like a circle.  Is it a circle? How could you prove this?<br />

Here are some more variations that employ color and more complex geometric arrangements.  Create these and your own variations in Snap<em>!</em>.<br />

<li>Use what you know about creating animations in Snap<em>!</em> to produce an animation based on the Astrid design.  To allow for dynamic movements such as rotations, you will need to reimagine a completely different way of creating your Astrid than joining points with fixed coordinates.  <a href="#hint-target3" data-toggle="collapse" class="collapsed" title="More information">Click here for an example.</a>
                            <div id="hint-target3" class="collapse">

<p>Below is an animation exploring the artistic concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_space" target="_blank">"negative space"</a>, which uses a grid of rotating Astrids.  You can see the organic frame surrounding the Astrids by concentrating on a blue oval and relaxing your eyes.  How would you revise your Astrid construction to generate animations like this?</p><br />
