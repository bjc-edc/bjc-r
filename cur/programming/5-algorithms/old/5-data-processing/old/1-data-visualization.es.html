        <div class="todo">GH feedback: Please provide the project.</div>

        <p>Seeing data presented graphically can give rise to new understandings more easily than trying to make sense of a long list of numbers.</p>
        <p>If you did Lab 2: Graphing Data and Functions, you've built your own app to plot pairs of numbers as points on the stage. If you like, you can use that one instead of the one we present below.</p>
        <div class="comment">Intro refers to EK 3.1.1A, 3.1.3A.</div>

                <li>Download <a href="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/plot.xml" download>this library</a>. It includes a <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/plotblock.es.png" alt="plot block"> block that takes a list of pairs of numbers as its input and plots them on the stage, automatically scaling so that they all fit.</li>

                    In  <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/X-gps-data/1-big-burger.es.html">Unit 4, Lab 2</a>,
                    <div class="sidenote">Remember, GPS data lists latitude first, but latitude is vertical when graphed.</div>
					you analyzed GPS data for Big Burger and changed the way you looked at the data to find clusters within it. Reopen your U4L2-GPSData project, and import the plot.xml library. Use <code>plot</code> to see the values.
                 </li>
				<li>How can you visualize just one of the three Big Burger clusters?</li>
				<div class="todo">
                	It's not clear what "How can you visualize just one of the three Big Burger clusters?" meant. At first, I thought #3 should say something clearer, like "Use <code>keep</code> to graph just one of the three Big Burger clusters." Then, after looking at 4.2 again, I realised that this might be referring to the <code>zone</code> block. Can someone who knows what this is supposed to mean please clarify the text? --MF
                </div>
				<li>For each cluster, find and plot the average of all the longitudes and latitudes of the cluster. Your work and blocks from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/X-gps-data/3-clustering.es.html">Unit 4, Lab 2</a> should be helpful!</li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.es.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Think of some ways data could be especially difficult to analyze through graphing. </li>
				<div class="todo"> Trying to hint at "big data" here. Wonder if kids will take note, but there are lots of other answers here -- qualitative or categorical data can't be graphed, missing or duplicated information causes havoc, etc. Could be a better phrasing.<p>I think a question like #5 will be much more effective posted by the Teacher than written out in the students materials. --MF</p></div>
