                    In <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/old/2-improving-search.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Analyzing and Improving Searches">Lab 1</a>, you built two reporters that output the position of an element in a list:
                    <div class="vocab">
                        <p>A <strong>linear search</strong> means searching a list from one item to the next. </p>
                        <p>A <strong>binary search</strong> means dividing a <em>sorted</em> list into two pieces at each step.</p>
					</div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The reporter <code>position of () in unsorted list</code> works for any list by checking element-by-element until it finds a match. This is called a <em>linear search</em> because the program searches from the beginning of the list to the match in a straight line.</li>
                        <li>The reporter <code>position of () in sorted list</code> works on sorted lists by repeatedly dividing the list into two equal-sized parts and using the middle value to decide which half can contain the match. This is called a <em>binary search</em> because binary means "two" and the algorithm divides the list into two parts.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Both will work on sorted lists. Compare them for some long sorted lists and make a table of your findings.	 You may have to use very large lists, say 1000 or 2000 items, to get meaningful results. Which algorithm is faster?
