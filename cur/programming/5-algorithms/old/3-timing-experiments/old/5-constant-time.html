        <h2>Analyzing the Behaviors</h2>

<div class="todo">BK: Removing this page from the lab for this cycle. Constant time is now discussed in the page on classifying algorithms.</div>


         <div class="dialogue">
        <div class="stagedir">
                Morgan and Jasmine are talking about their work so far. 
            </div>
        
       
            <div><span>Morgan: </span> I don't see how you can say that a reporter takes a certain amount of time when different computers run at different speeds.  So, what takes 92 millesconds on one machine may take half of that on another. </div >
            	
            <div><span>Jasmine: </span> Well, look at the graphs we made on the page before this.  You can't  see how <em>long</em> the reporter takes to output, you just see how the run time of the reporter scales as we look at larger and larger inputs.  <em>That's</em> a property of the reporter that will hold on any computer. </div>
            
            
            <div><span>Morgan: </span> Good.  But graphs are tricky.  By changing the scales of the axes, you can make a curve look like a line or <em>vice-versa</em>. Looking at our graphs gives us an idea of what's happening with the rum time, but I think we need a more reliable method.</div>
            
			
      </div>

<div class="takeNote">  The "more reliable method" that Morgan wants comes from the mathematics behind the graphs you generated.  Many of those graphs can be approximated with the graph of an equation of the form <span class="katex">y = f(x) </span>  where <span class="katex"> f  </span> is a function that you've seen in algebra class, like <span class="katex">y = x^2 </span> or <span class="katex">y = 3x </span>.    
</div>
        
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">

<div class="sidenote">``Sketch'' means by hand or computer.  You've got some nice graphing programs, so &hellip; </div> 
<p>Sketch the graphs of</p>

        <h3>Constant Time</h3>
		
 
 
        
       
<p>One of the simplest reporters reporters has to be "add 1''. </p>
         
        <div class="forYouToDo" >
            <ol start="5">
<div class="sidenote">Pick some small inputs and some very big ones.</div>  
                <li> Experiment with the <code>average time</code> of adding 1 to whole numbers of various sizes, and make a data-plot of the average times.  For example, you could try something like this:</li>
 
 
 <p><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/constant.png" alt="list of constant times" title="list of constant times" /> </p>
               
 <p> <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/graphdat.png" alt="data-plot of constant time" title="data-plot of constant time" />  </p>             
               
   <li> <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />  Describe the behavior of the run-time.            
               
</ol>
      
        </div>
 <div class="takeNote"> <p>You probably noticed that the computer takes approximately the same time to add 1  a number, no matter how large the number is. This is why computer scientists call adding 1 to number a <em>constant-time</em> operation. It turns out  that  any  basic arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation) is  a constant-time operation. <div class="sidenote">Try timing the "multiply by 3" reporter.  What about "add 275?".</div>       
  </p>
        
      
        <p>Constant-time operations are prized by computer scienctists, but, unfortunately, most algorithms are  not  constant-time.</p>

            <ol start="7">
           
        <li> Which of the reporters that you've built up to now are constant time?

   <div class="takeItFurther">
   
   <div class="sidenote">One way to think about this question is to pick a few numbers and add 1 to each <em>by hand</em> as you did in elementary school.  Maybe time yourself.</div>
