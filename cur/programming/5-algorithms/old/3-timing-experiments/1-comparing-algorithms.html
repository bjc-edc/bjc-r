            <p>We should change the CSS so that sidenotes never extend behind the element they are about; add space to the element if necessary. For example, that "Read this out loud" box shouldn't overlap the orange. --MF, 12/27/17</p>

            <p>PG: I've never loved any part of this lab, but we need the content in some form. This page takes the special case of triangular numbers and shows how the closed form is clearly more efficient than anything else: the positive message is that a bit of forethought (mathematics) can be efficient. The problem is that it is such a special case and that combine gets dismissed so quickly. I've also never been thrilled with the timer.</p>
            <p>BH: This whole unit needs rethinking.  Limiting the discussion to what the AP requires makes it boring.  Bring back activities about all the categories from constant to exponential time, including n log n, etc. <br />The numbers from A to B block is now in the tools library.</p>
            <p>MF: needs formatting edits, but more importantly, the page is too long and the context is too much overhead to teach efficiency</p>

                Morgan and Jasmine are creating algorithms that take a positive integer as input and report the sum of all integers from 1 to the input number, like this: <br />

                Their two different approaches always give the same outputs for the same inputs. Morgan and Jasmine are discussing their different approaches.

            <div><span>Morgan: </span> I made two new blocks. First, I created a reporter to list of all the integers between and including two integers, and then I used <code>combine</code> to add up the list.</div>

For example:<br />

                <div class="sidenoteBig"><code>Combine</code> is a <em>higher order function</em>. This means that it is a function that takes a function as input. You've seen some higher order functions already: <code>keep</code> (in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/5-keeping-list-items.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Keeping Items from a List">Unit 2 Lab 3</a>) and <code>map</code> (in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-contact-list/5-mapping-over-list.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Transforming Every List Item">Unit 3 Lab 1</a>).</div>
                    <p>You choose the operation, and <code>combine</code> performs that operation by <em>combining</em> all the items in the input list and then reports the result.</p>
                    <p>Notice that the function used to <em>combine</em> the list items always has two blank input slots. Both <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> only need one blank in their input function, but with <code>combine</code>, two are required.</p>

                    Among blocks you might write yourself, there are only two likely candidates:<br />

                    <div id="hint-3" class="collapse">
                    	The function has to be <em>associative</em>, meaning that it doesn't matter what order you group the items in; (7&thinsp;+&thinsp;8)&thinsp;+&thinsp;1 is the same as 7&thinsp;+&thinsp;(8&thinsp;+&thinsp;1) (work it out yourself), but (7&thinsp;−&thinsp;8)&thinsp;−&thinsp;1 is different from 7&thinsp;−&thinsp;(8&thinsp;−&thinsp;1).
