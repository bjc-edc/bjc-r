                More practice with functional programming to solve a relatively serious problem.

            <p>
                <strong>Why here?</strong>
                In Unit 3, they made a program that can detect wins and ties, but doesn't generate moves. Unit 4 is a non-programming one, so U5 is the next chance to extend it. (I'm hoping to put a stream version as an all-TIF optional project in U8.)

        <h2>Review Your Tic-Tac-Toe Project</h2>
        <div class="todo">I was looking for ways to scaffold this project without excessive handholding, and I decided to have them implement a <strong>randomly playing computer player</strong> first and then build in the strategy later. As a result, this first page doesn't have to wait until U5. For example, it might be nice to have it at the end of U3 or the beginning of U4 <em>before TCP</em> since that project uses <code>broadcast</code> and this first is easier to understand than that project. --MF, 6/7/18</div>

            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll make the computer play against the human player <em>randomly</em>.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The game currently allows two human players to take turns playing. We need to make a way for the human player to take turns with a computer player that will take turns automatically. To simplify the project, we'll assume that the human player will always move first (playing X), and so the computer is playing O.</p>
        <p>
            First, we'll create two abstractions (<code>make player move</code> and <code>check for wins and ties</code>) using the code you already have so that:

                <li>You can use them to check for wins and ties for both players too.</li>

                    Program more rules to make the computer a better player.  This will involve looking more than one move ahead.  There are various ways to do it, and what follows is just one suggestion.

                            It's not good enough just to look for a winning move for yourself two moves from now. If you can see such a move, so can your opponent, who'll move to block you. So what you have to find is a <em>fork: </em>two triples in which you have one appearance and your opponent has none, and which have a free square in common. This is much easier to see with a picture:
                            <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/fork.png" alt="board with fork" title="board with fork" /></p>
                            <p>X opened the game with the standard opening move, in the center. O  responded very badly, on the top edge, and is therefore about to lose the game. X played in the top left corner. O had to respond in the bottom right corner in order to block an immediate win for X. It's X's turn. There is no winning combination with two Xs, nor with two Os. But X can find <em>two</em> winning combinations, the ones marked with the red lines, both of which have one X and two free squares, <em>with one of the free squares in common. </em>In the picture, the common square is 4, the left edge square, and so that's where X should move.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Trick question to make sure you're paying attention: Wouldn't it be better to find a fork in which X has <em>two</em> apperances in each triple? Discuss this with your partner if you don't have a good answer.</li>
                        <li>The point of the fork is that if X moves in square 4, then X has two winning combinations for next time. It's O's turn, but O can block only one of the two wins, and so X fills out the remaining winning combination two moves from now. For example, if O moves in square 6 to block the center row, then X moves in square 7 to win in the left column. Conversely, if O moves in 7, then X moves in 6 and wins.</li>
                        <li>Find all the triples (that is, report a <em>list of triples</em>) in which the computer has one square, and the other two are empty and store in a variable called <var>singles</var>.</li>
                        <div class="sidenoteBig">"Atom" is a technical term for a value that isn't a list. A list contains a bunch of items, just as a molecule contains a bunch of atoms.</div>    
                        <li>
                            Make one big list of all the letters and numbers from the triples:<br />

                        </li>

                        <li>Now find a number that appears more than once in <code>atoms</code>.</li>

                <li>Here's a completely different approach to Tic-Tac-Toe: Make a permanent list of <em>key-value pairs</em> in which the key (the first item of a pair) is a possible state of the board <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/board.png" alt="board" title="board"> and the value (the second item) is a number saying where to move next. This would be really messy if you had to account for every possible board position, but you only need to consider the ones in which neither player has won yet. Also, you can make a special case for the computer's first move. If the computer is playing O, there are really only three ways X can have made the first move: the center, a corner, or an edge. If X moved in a corner, <em>renumber</em> the board so that the corner where X moved becomes 1, and similarly for an edge move. (This will take some effort in the program; you can't just wish away the fact that X may have moved in square 3, say, rather than 1.) Then the computer can move just by looking for the current board situation in the list.</li>

                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
                <li>Here's yet a third approach: Have the same key-value list, but have it start out empty. If the computer moves next and the current board situation isn't in the key-value list, make a <em>random</em> move, keep a record of it, and see what happens. If the program loses a game, it should note that its last move wasn't a good one, and next time that same board position comes up, try a different random move. This <em>learning </em>version is complicated to write, but it's much more like a serious artificial intelligence program, and it's not limited to Tic-Tac-Toe.  You can use the same algorithm to play any strategy game. Once you've written the program, you can let it play <em>against itself</em> a few thousand times and save the resulting key-value list. </li>
