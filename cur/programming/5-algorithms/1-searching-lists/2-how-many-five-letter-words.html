            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will compare two different problems to understand how some problems can be solved by algorithms that use a more efficient search strategy like you used to find the secret number.</p>

                    <p>The <code>computation time</code> block takes any reporter (with its inputs filled in), computes the result, and reports <em>how long it took</em> to do the computation (in milliseconds).</p>

                    <p>In this example, it took 27 milliseconds to compute the list of integers from 1 to 1000. (The number you see reported will depend on how fast your computer is and what other programs are running on it.)</p>

                    <div class="todo">I think this is all that is really needed except that within the function, we should have a comment that says, "call the reporter that you're trying to time, but ignores its report".

                <li>Use the <code>computation time</code> block to determine how many five-letter words are in the <var>100,000 words</var> list. </li>
                <li>
                    Suppose instead, we count the seven letter words. This will take:
                    <ol>
                        <li>More time because seven letters is more than five letters.</li>
                        <li>Less time because there are fewer seven letter words than five letter words.</li>
                        <li>The same time because it's not the word length that matters; it's the size of the dictionary.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> And then experiment to find out for sure.

        <p>The only way to answer this problem is to check every single word in the dictionary. So if you have <strong>ten times as many</strong> words in the dictionary, it takes <strong>ten times as long</strong> to check them all. </p>
