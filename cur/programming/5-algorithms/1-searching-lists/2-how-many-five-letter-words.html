                    <div class="endnote">This project provides the variables <var>1,000 words</var>, <var>10,000 words</var>, and <var>100,000 words</var> (each containing a list of words) and a copy of the <code>does () have () letters?</code> predicate.</div>
                </li>
				<li>How many five-letter words are in the <var>10,000 words</var> list?</li>
                <li>Use the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/computation-time-of.png" alt="computation time of 'grey ring input slot'" title="computation time of 'grey ring input slot'" /> block provided in this project to determine how long it takes for the computer to answer that question.</li>

        <p>
            The <code>computation time</code> block takes any reporter (with its inputs filled in), computes the result but ignores it, and instead reports <em>how long it took</em> to do the computation (in milliseconds).<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/computation-time-reporting.png" alt="computation time of (numbers from (1) to (1000)) reporting 27" title="computation time of (numbers from (1) to (1000)) reporting 27" />
        </p>
        <p>In this example, it took 27 milliseconds to compute the list of integers from 1 to 1000. (The report you see will depend on how fast your computer is and what other programs are running on it.)</p>
        <p>You can look inside <code>computation time</code> to see how it works: Right-click (or control-click on a mac) the block and select "edit..." from the menu that appears.</p>

			<ol start="4">
                <li>Click on the <code>computation time</code> expression you just used to answer the previous question three more times and note the range of answers. They're not exactly the same because of other things that your computer is doing at the same time, so you should always take whatever result it gives you as <em>approximate</em>.</li>
