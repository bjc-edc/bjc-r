            <p>June has some concern that this is not a motivating context. Mary wonders about connecting it back to the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/3-solving-word-puzzle.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">word puzzle context</a>. --MF, 3/29/19</p>
            <p>The following white-text is my attempt to resolve this. --MF, 4/1/19</p>

But how long does a process like that take?</p>

                    <p>In this example, it took 27 milliseconds to compute the list of integers from 1 to 1000. (The report you see will depend on how fast your computer is and what other programs are running on it.)</p>

                <li>Click on <code>computation time of (</code><var>10,000 words</var><code>)</code> three times and note the range of answers. They're not exactly the same because of other things that your comptuer is doing at the same time, so you should always take whatever result it gives you as <em>approximate</em>.</li>

                    Suppose instead, we count the <em>seven</em> letter words. This will take:

                        <li>More time because seven letters is more than five letters.</li>
                        <li>Less time because there are fewer seven letter words than five letter words.</li>
                        <li>The same time because it's not the word length that matters; it's the size of the dictionary.</li>
