                    Suppose instead, we count the seven letter words. This will take:
                    <ol>
                        <li>More time because seven letters is more than five letters.</li>
                        <li>Less time because there are fewer seven letter words than five letter words.</li>
                        <li>The same time because it's not the word length that matters; it's the size of the dictionary.</li>

                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> And then experiment to find out for sure.
