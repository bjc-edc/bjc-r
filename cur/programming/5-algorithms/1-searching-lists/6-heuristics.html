            <p>If a problem can be solved in exponential time, there may be a different algorithm that can do it in polynomial time, but some problems can't possibly be done in polynomial time. It's important to recognize that an exponential time algorithm <strong>still solves a problem correctly</strong>. Exponential time algorithms can sometimes be replaced by <em>heuristics</em>, which are polynomial-time algorithms that don't solve the problem exactly, but give a good enough approximation. <!--Heuristics are useful when a problem has has a solution, and although we can't compute the solution in a practical amount a time, we can still find "pretty good" solutions.--></p>

                <li>An <b>optimization problem</b> is one with the goal of finding the <em>best</em> solution among many (for example...).</li>
                <li>A <b>decision problem</b> is a problem with a true/false answer (for example, "is 5,825,496,221 a prime number?").</li>

            An example of a problem for which a heuristic solution is useful is the <strong>traveling salesperson problem</strong>: For a group of cities, what is the shortest route for a salesperson to visit every city and return to their home city? This is good case for heuristics because:
            <ol>
                <li>It's clear that there is a shortest route.</li>
                <li>There is no known polynomial time algorithm for this problem, and most computer scientists think that it's not possible to write one.</li>
                <li>There <em>is</em> a possible heuristic: pick a path at random, then try to improve it by swapping two cities repeatedly until you can't make the path better with such small changes.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="endnote">This heuristic is called "hill climbing" because you'll find the best <em>nearby</em> path (the top of a hill), but there might be a higher hill (a better path) further away.</div>

            One reason it's worth learning these categories is to avoid reinventing the wheel. For example, you've learned that if a list is sorted you can search it in sublinear time using binary search. So when you're writing a program that needs to search through a list repeatedly, it's worthwhile to sort the list before searching. Knowing about algorithms that already exist can help you construct new algorithms.
