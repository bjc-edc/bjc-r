    	<h2>Removing Duplicates</h2>
		<div class="learn">
        	<p>
                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn a recursive technique to remove duplicates from a list.<br />

        </div>

        <p>Suppose you have a list of items and want to know if the elements of the list are <em>distinct</em>. For example, you might want to make sure that you don't have anything on your shopping list twice.</p>
        <p>As a first step, we'll just answer the yes/no question: are there any duplicates on your list?<br />

                    Finish building the <code>are the items distinct?</code> predicate, which is started below. Since you're writing a predicate, your procedure should always report <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.<br />

                        Notice that this procedure calls itself at the end. (It is <em>recursive.</em>) This won't work if the input to that call is the same as the original input. So you can't say <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/report-are-items-of-data-distinct.png" alt="report (are the items of (data) distinct?)" title="report (are the items of (data) distinct?)" />.

        <p>For your grocery list, you wouldn't just want to know whether or not there are duplicates. You'd want a new list with the duplicates removed.</p>

                    Build a <code>distinct items from</code> reporter using a structure similar to that of the <code>are the items distinct?</code> predicate.

So look at the three <code>report</code> blocks in your code for the <code>are the items distinct?</code> predicate, and decide what they should report for the <code>distinct items from</code> reporter.</p>
