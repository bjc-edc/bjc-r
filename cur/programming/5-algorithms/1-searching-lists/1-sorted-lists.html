    	<h2>Searching a Sorted List</h2>
        <div class="todo">from 3/10/16 team meeting: Brian suggests that we give them 2-line button code for the sprites and <code>when I receive</code> scripts so they have a hint about how to structure the control flow. --MF</div>
        <div class="todo">From Observation Notes Analysis: U5L1: "The goal of the lab is to emphasize the idea of dividing the search space in half on each guess, but what I mostly saw was kids confused about which sprite does what; they all had three button sprites and a fourth control sprite (that was yesterday's lesson), but mostly they didn't have any /code/ in the button sprites, and didn't (when I asked) know about "when I am clicked." So instead they had the control sprite doing everything."</div>

                	In Unit 2, you built a number guessing game in which the computer picked a number, you guessed, and it told you whether your guess was too high, too low, or just right.  One simple version of that game is in the project link below; click the picture to open it.

                <li>Play the game a few times and keep track of how many guesses it took you to guess the computer's secret number.</li>

                <li>What strategy could Betsy use to <em>always</em> guess the number in a lot less than 12 tries? Describe your strategy clearly and precisely enough for your pair programmer to use it in playing the game.</li>
                <div class="todo">This example and graphic should use the same parameters as the game above. Using 1 to 60 would force students to recognize they need to round when calculating the middle number.</div>
                <li>With your partner, build a program that uses your strategy to guess someone's secret number. If your secret number is 21, the program should work something like this:
