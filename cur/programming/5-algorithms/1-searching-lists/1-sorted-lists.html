        	<p><strong>In this lab</strong>, you will investigate various algorithms for finding things in a list.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will improve your number guessing game from Unit 2 to make the computer guess your number using the best strategy.</p>

                    Now make <em>the computer</em> guess <em>your</em> number using this strategy.
