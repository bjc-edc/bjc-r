            <p>From Observation Notes Analysis: U5L1: "The goal of the lab is to emphasize the idea of dividing the search space in half on each guess, but what I mostly saw was kids confused about which sprite does what; they all had three button sprites and a fourth control sprite (that was yesterday's lesson), but mostly they didn't have any /code/ in the button sprites, and didn't (when I asked) know about "when I am clicked." So instead they had the control sprite doing everything."</p>
