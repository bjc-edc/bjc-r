        	<p><strong>In this lab</strong>, you will explore various algorithms for searching a list.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will revise your number guessing game from Unit 2 to make the computer guess your number.</p>
            <div class="todo">These sound disconnected. Need to connect them. BH wants to fix "in this lab" to fix "on this page". --MF, 3/13/19</div>
