    	<h2>Searching a Sorted List</h2>
        <div class="todo">
        	<p>from 3/10/16 team meeting: Brian suggests that we give them 2-line button code for the sprites and <code>when I receive</code> scripts so they have a hint about how to structure the control flow. --MF</p>
            <p>From Observation Notes Analysis: U5L1: "The goal of the lab is to emphasize the idea of dividing the search space in half on each guess, but what I mostly saw was kids confused about which sprite does what; they all had three button sprites and a fourth control sprite (that was yesterday's lesson), but mostly they didn't have any /code/ in the button sprites, and didn't (when I asked) know about "when I am clicked." So instead they had the control sprite doing everything."</p>

                    With your partner, build a program that uses your strategy to guess someone's secret number. If your secret number is 21, the program should work something like this:
