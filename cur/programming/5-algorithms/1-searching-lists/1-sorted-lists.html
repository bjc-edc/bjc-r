            <p>PG: Alphie's first statement makes no senseâ€”the numbers go only from 1 to 10.  By unit 5 should we still be doing the social engineering? Feels babyish to me.</p>
            <p>BH: This lab is basically okay, but not very exciting.  Seems to take a long time for a pretty easy lesson.<br />The animation doesn't change enough between guesses; it took me a long time to notice anything changed at all.  The speech balloon should disappear for a while then come back with a new guess.</p>
