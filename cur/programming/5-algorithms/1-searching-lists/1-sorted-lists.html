        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>In this lab</strong>, you will use two different algorithms to search a list, and you will learn that algorithms are categorized by the time required to run them.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will modify your number guessing game from Unit 2 to make the computer do the guessing.</p>

                <li>Play a few times. Keep track of how many guesses it takes you to identify the number each time.</li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Develop a strategy that will identify the secret number in no more than 6 guesses.</li>

                    Now make <em>the computer</em> guess <em>your</em> number using this strategy.
