		<h2>Parallelism</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn how running multiple scripts in parallel can reduce the total time it takes to run an algorithm.</p>
        </div>
        <p>In Snap<em>!</em>, you are accustomed to seeing a bunch of scripts that all run independently, which may or may not be associated with different sprites. This is kind of like <em>parallel computing</em>. So, if we had a different computer for each sprite, that would be true parallelism. As it is, there is only one computer, and it divides its attention among the processes by running a little bit of one and then running a little bit of the next one. Specifically, it switches at the bottom of loops (<code>forever</code>, <code>repeat</code>, etc.).</p>

            <p>
                This section covers two computational models:
                <ul>
                    <li>In <strong>sequential computing</strong>, operations are performed in order one at a time.</li>
                    <li>In <strong>parallel computing</strong>, the program is broken into smaller steps, some of which are performed at the same time. Modern computers have multiple processors (2, 4, or 8) in a single computer, so you can do small-scale parallel processing on the machine on your desk.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="ap-standard">CSN-2.A.4</div>
        <p>You can compare the efficiency of two different algorithmic solutions to a problem by comparing the time it takes them to perform the same task.</p>

            <p><strong>Distributed computing</strong> is a form of parallel computing that uses multiple computers (perhaps even spread out around the world).</p>
        </div>
        <p>Writing a program that does nothing but wait is, of course, unrealistic, but what <em>is</em> realistic is that in most problems, there isn't a solution that's purely parallel. Some part of the computation has to be done sequentially. In the previous question, the sequential part is modeled by <code>wait 6 secs</code>. Parallelization with this silly example feels trivial, but imagine you work for Google. Millions of search queries and web page edits have happened today, and it's your job to have to process them. If they didn't have huge server farms with thousands of computers in each building, they couldn't keep up at all. Distributed computing lets you <em>scale</em> to very large problems.</p>

            As a more specific example, suppose you want to know the average word length in list of 100,000 words. You can divide the task among several computers (one for each starting letter). Each computer adds the lengths of all the words assigned to it (all the "A" words, all the "B" words, etc). Then one computer has to add the 26 partial results and divide by the total number of words to find the average. To calculate the run time of this parallel solution, you would add the run time of the longest parallel portion (the run time for the letter with the most words) to the run time of the sequential portion (adding the 26 partial results and dividing the sum by the total number of words).

For example, if you got five birthday presents, you might be happier than if you got only one, but getting more presents isn't necessarily better. Imagine you received a hundred  presents. You'd get bored opening them and probably feel overwhelmed. And getting a thousand or a million presents wouldn't make your birthday any happier. The same rule applies to birthday cake!</div>

                Programmers refer to the <strong>speedup</strong> of parallel solution to describe how many times as fast the parallel solution is compared to the sequential solution:<br />
            <span class="katex indent">\text{speedup} = \frac{\text{sequential time}}{\text{parallel time}}</span>

        <p>Computer hardware is very reliable; it's rare for the hardware to break down while you're running a program. But in distributed computing with tens of thousands of computers working on the same problem, it's <em>likely</em> that one of them will fail. (If the probability of one computer failing during a program run is 0.0001, and you use 10,000 computers, then the probability of one of them failing is about 0.368&mdash;about a third of the time!) So software has to compensate by checking that the machines are running and reassigning the tasks of a failed computer to a working one.</p>
        <p>Also, when you are doing things in parallel, the parallel processes can interfere with each other.

                    <p>Because ATM 2 changed the account balance after ATM 1 looked up the balance, ATM 1 didn't know that the balance had been changed. The bank account ended up a balance of $80 even though it started at $100 and a total of $60 was withdrawn.</p>

        <p>For these reasons and others, a parallel program is harder to write and debug than a sequential program.</p>
