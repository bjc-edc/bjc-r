            <p>For what it's worth, there are no standards on this page. Also, it's Unit 5, and a lot of folks are running out of time by then, so I just convinced myself that this should be skippable. --MF, 8/15/19</p>

        <p>Suppose you have a list of items and want to know if the elements of the list are <em>distinct</em>. For example, you might want to make sure that you don't have anything on your shopping list twice.</p>
        <p>As a first step, we'll just answer the yes/no question: are there any duplicates on your list?<br />
