        <p>Suppose you have a list of items and want to know if the elements of the list are <em>distinct</em>. For example, you might want to make sure that you don't have anything on your shopping list twice.</p>
        <p>As a first step, we'll just answer the yes/no question: are there any duplicates on your list?<br />

                    Finish building the <code>are the items distinct?</code> predicate. Since you're writing a predicate, your procedure should always report <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.<br />

                        This won't work if the input to that call is the same as the original input. So you can't say <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/report-are-items-of-data-distinct.png" alt="" title="" />. Instead, you have to use a smaller input value.

        <p>For your grocery list, you wouldn't just want to know whether or not there are duplicates. You'd want a new list with the duplicates removed.</p>

But that was a predicate. This one has to report a list. So look at the three <code>report</code> blocks in your code for the <code>are the items distinct?</code> predicate, and decide what they should report for the <code>distinct items from</code> reporter.</p>
