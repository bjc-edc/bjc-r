        <h3>Searching in Unsorted Data</h3>
        <p>When searching for an item in <em>unsorted</em> data, you have to check every item until you find the value you are looking for.</p>

                    Build a <code>position of number in unsorted list</code> block that reports the earliest location of a number in an unsorted list or reports "Not In List" (or NIL, if you like) if the number is not in the list.<br />

        <h3>Searching in Sorted Data</h3>
        <p>If you are searching for a number in a <em>sorted</em> list, you have more information. Suppose you have a sorted list and you want to locate the position of a number.</p>

                <span>Morgan: </span> But in that one, the computer guessed a number that we picked.  Now we want it to find a number in a list and report its position. It should work like this:<br />
