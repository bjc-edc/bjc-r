        <h3>Searching in Unsorted Data</h3>
        <p>When searching for an item in <em>unsorted</em> data, you have to check every item until you find the value you are looking for.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Build a <code>position of number in unsorted list</code> block that reports the earliest location of a number in an unsorted list or reports "Not In List" (or NIL, if you like) if the number is not in the list.<br />

        </div>
	    <div class="endnote">Searching unsorted data can become slow if we're dealing with a lot of data, but it is quick when working with short lists.</div>


        <h3>Searching in Sorted Data</h3>
        <p>If you are searching for a number in a <em>sorted</em> list, you have more information. Suppose you have a sorted list and you want to locate the position of a number.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Typically, sorted lists are from lowest to highest. You'll create a block that sorts a list of numbers in Unit 8, <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/8-recursive-reporters/2-sorting/1-sorting-a-list.es.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F7-recursive-reporters.es.topic&course=bjc4nyc.es.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Sorting a List">Sorting a List</a>.</div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>Alphie: </span> If the list is sorted, we could look at the  middle element of the list and see if our number is in the first or last half of the list. That would save time.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> This feels a lot like the guessing game we built&mdash;I pick a number and the computer tries to guess it by splitting the list in half with each guess.</div>
            <div class="comment">Brian wants us to scrub the list name "awful list" from the curriculum, and Mary agrees. --MF, 2/22/18</div>

			<div>
                <span>Alphie: </span> But in that one, the computer guessed a number that we picked.  Now we want it to find a number in a list and report its position. It should work like this:<br />

            </div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> Yes, but it still <em>feels</em> the same. It should have the same guts as the guessing game.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="takeNote">Betsy's last remark is a version of <strong>abstraction</strong>. Betsy noticed that <code>position in sorted list</code> and the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/1-sorted-lists.es.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.es.topic&course=bjc4nyc.es.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Searching a Sorted List">number guesser algorithm</a> should have the same overall <em>structure</em>.
