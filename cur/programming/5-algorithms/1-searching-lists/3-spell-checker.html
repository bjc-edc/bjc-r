		<h2>Is "Seperate" Spelled Correctly?</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <h3>TG and solutions need to be checked. --MF, 12/19/18</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will use a <em>binary search</em> algorithm to search efficiently in a <em>sorted</em> list.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Answering this question is simple in Snap<em>!</em> because you can just ask a dictionary: <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/100000-words-contains-seperate.png" alt="100000-words-contains-seperate.png" title="(100,000 words) contains (seperate)" />. But <em>"simple" doesn't mean fast</em>. The <code>contains</code> block still has to look at each item in the list until it finds the one you are looking for (and says <code>true</code>) or reaches the end of the list (and says <code>false</code>).  It is still a linear search.</p>
        <p>When you are only looking for <em>one</em> thing in a list (for example, checking whether a particular word is spelled correctly) rather than finding <em>all</em> the words with some characteristic (for example, looking for all five-letter words), you can use the strategy from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/1-sorted-lists.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Page 1: Guess My Number">Page 1: Guess My Number</a> to make your algorithm faster. The best strategy for that problem is a <em>binary search</em> algorithm: always guess the <em>middle</em> value and then adjust your guess based on whether it was too high or too low. That way, you eliminate half the possibilities with each guess. We can use a similar strategy to look for a word in a word list.</p>
        <div class="endnote">You could have written a simpler number guessing program: the computer could guess the number 1, then 2, then 3, and so on until it finds the number. That would be a <em>linear search</em> algorithm; it's easier to code, but it takes longer to run because every time it makes a wrong guess, it eliminates only that guess. With binary search, every wrong guess eliminates <em>half</em> the possibilities at once.</div>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Binary Search</strong>
        	<div class="ap-standard">AAP-2.P.1, AAP-2.P.2</div>
            <p>A <strong>binary search</strong> algorithm starts in the middle of a <em>sorted</em> list and repeatedly eliminates half the list until either the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated.</p>
            <div class="ap-standard">AAP-2.O.1</div>
            <div class="sidenoteBig">You learned about traversing a list on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/3-traversing-list.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 2 Lab 2 Page 3: Checking Each Quiz Answer">Unit 2 Lab 2 Page 3: Checking Each Quiz Answer</a>.</div>
            <p>Linear search does a <em>complete</em> traversal of the list. Binary search saves time by doing a <em>partial</em> traversal of the list.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote">The one thing that almost everyone knows about computers is that they use binary: ones and zeros. Binary search has nothing to do with that. The word "binary" just means "two," whether it's two digits or two halves.</div>
