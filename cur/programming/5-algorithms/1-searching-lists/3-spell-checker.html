            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will learn how the type of problem and also the structure of the data changes what algorithms you can use.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Answering this question is easy in Snap<em>!</em>, because you can just say <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/100000-words-contains-seperate.png" alt="100000-words-contains-seperate.png" title="(100,000 words) contains (seperate)" />. But <em>"easy" doesn't mean fast</em>. The <code>contains</code> block still has to look at each item in the list until it finds the one you are looking for (and says <code>true</code>) or reaches the end of the list (and says <code>false</code>). </p>
        <p>When you are only looking for <em>one</em> thing in a list (for example, checking whether a particular word is spelled correctly) rather than finding <em>all</em> the words with some characteristic (for example, looking for all five-letter words), you can use the strategy from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/1-sorted-lists.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Page 1: Guess My Number to make your algorithm faster.">Page 1: Guess My Number</a> to make your algorithm faster. The best strategy for that problem is a <em>binary search</em> algorithm: always guess the <em>middle</em> value. That way, you eliminate half the possibilities with each guess. We can use a similar strategy to look for a word in a word list.</p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Binary Search</strong>
        	<div class="comment">AAP-2.P.1, AAP-2.P.2</div>
            <p>A <strong>binary search</strong> algorithm starts in the middle of a <em>sorted</em> list and repeatedly eliminates half the list until either the desired data is found or all elements have been eliminated.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote">When you see the word "binary" you probably think about ones and zeros. Binary search has nothing to do with that. The word "binary" just means "two," whether it's two digits or two halves.</div>

        <div class="todo">For TG hints: If the number is in the list more than once, any one that you find is ok.</div>
        
        <p>You could have written a simpler number guessing program: the computer could guess the number 1, then 2, then 3, and so on until it finds the number. That would be a <em>linear search</em> algorithm; it's easier to code, but it takes longer to run because every time it makes a wrong guess, it only eliminates only that guess. With binary search,  every wrong guess eliminates <em>half</em> the possibilities at once.</p>

            Mary wants to be sure these ideas are clear:
            <p>Somewhere in there we say, or have them figure out, that this works only if the list is alphabetized.  </p>
		    <p>Data must be sorted in order to use the binary search algorithm.</p>
            <p>In guess my number, you can find the halfway point, by using the average of the two end points, but with a list, you can take the average to find the position of the halfway point, but hen you have to actually look at the value at that position.</p>
            I'm feeling better about these at this point. What do you think? --MF, 3/29/19

        <p>This is why <code>contains</code> works the way it does; it can't make any assumptions about the list you are searching, but if you are only looking for one thing in a sorted list...</p>
