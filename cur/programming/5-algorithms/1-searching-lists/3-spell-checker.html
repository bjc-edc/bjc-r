        <h2>Is "Seperate" Spelled Correctly?</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will use a <em>binary search</em> algorithm to search efficiently in a <em>sorted</em> list.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="todo">Paul rejects the use of the word "easy" here. --MF, 5/28/19</div>
        <p>Answering this question is easy in Snap<em>!</em>, because you can just ask <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/100000-words-contains-seperate.png" alt="100000-words-contains-seperate.png" title="(100,000 words) contains (seperate)" />. But <em>"easy" doesn't mean fast</em>. The <code>contains</code> block still has to look at each item in the list until it finds the one you are looking for (and says <code>true</code>) or reaches the end of the list (and says <code>false</code>). </p>
        <p>When you are only looking for <em>one</em> thing in a list (for example, checking whether a particular word is spelled correctly) rather than finding <em>all</em> the words with some characteristic (for example, looking for all five-letter words), you can use the strategy from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/1-sorted-lists.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Page 1: Guess My Number to make your algorithm faster.">Page 1: Guess My Number</a> to make your algorithm faster. The best strategy for that problem is a <em>binary search</em> algorithm: always guess the <em>middle</em> value. That way, you eliminate half the possibilities with each guess. We can use a similar strategy to look for a word in a word list.</p>
        <div class="endnote">You could have written a simpler number guessing program: the computer could guess the number 1, then 2, then 3, and so on until it finds the number. That would be a <em>linear search</em> algorithm; it's easier to code, but it takes longer to run because every time it makes a wrong guess, it eliminates only that guess. With binary search, every wrong guess eliminates <em>half</em> the possibilities at once.</div>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Binary Search</strong>
        	<div class="comment">AAP-2.P.1, AAP-2.P.2</div>
            <p>A <strong>binary search</strong> algorithm starts in the middle of a <em>sorted</em> list and repeatedly eliminates half the list until either the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote">The one thing that almost everyone knows about computers is that they use binary: ones and zeros. Binary search has nothing to do with that. The word "binary" just means "two," whether it's two digits or two halves.</div>
