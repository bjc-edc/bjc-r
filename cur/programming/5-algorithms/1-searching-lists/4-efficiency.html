            The actual amount of physical time that it takes to solve a problem depends not only on your algorithm but also on how fast your computer is and what other programs you have running, etc. Therefore, computer scientists who want to measure the speed of an algorithm do it in terms of the number of <em>steps</em>. For example, what we really want to know about the efficiency of the <code>linear search</code> algorithm is how many times <var>current item</var> is compared to <var>value</var> (that is, how many times <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/current-item=value.png" alt="(current item) = (value)" title="(current item) = (value)" /> is called).

Then have a few students share their number of steps and observe that everyone (ideally) has the same count for the steps. This is because the number of steps is a fixed quantity, whereas the time the algorithm takes to run depends on the speed of the computer and what else it's doing at that moment. </div>

        <p>You can classify algorithms by the amount of time they take to run. <!--To classify an algorithm, you look at the number of steps it takes to complete the algorithm and compare it to the size of the input. For example, <code>25,000 integers</code> takes <em>constant time:</em> computing 25,000 integers starting at seven takes as long as computing 25,000 integers starting at seven million. As a second example, <code>linear search</code> takes <em>linear time:</em> if you have ten times as many words in the dictionary, then it takes ten times as long to search through them all. As a third example, consider the <code>sort</code> algorithm you timed. It takes <em>quadratic time:</em> multiplying the input size by ten multiplies the time required by 10<sup>2</sup>. As another example, consider the <code>binary search</code> algorithm you timed. In binary search, multiplying the input size by ten <em>adds</em> a constant amount to the time required instead of multiplying by a constant amount. This is an example of <em>sublinear time</em>.--></p>

        <p>The difference between linear search and binary search can be very important if you're searching in a list of ten million items, but the <em>most</em> important difference in algorithm efficiency is between polynomial time (proportional to any power of the input size) and exponential time.</p>

                    An algorithm takes <strong>exponential time</strong> if the number of steps is less than or equal to a function like 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>, 10<sup><em>n</em></sup>, etc., which is much slower than any polynomial.

        <p>In an exponential time algorithm, just <em>adding 1</em> to the input size (<em>n</em>) of a 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> time algorithm <em>doubles</em> the number of steps!

				<p>A problem that may be familiar that requires an exponential time algorithm is computing any given element of Pascal's Triangle. In Pascal's Triangle, each number is found by adding the two numbers above it. For example, 4 + 6 = 10 and 15 + 6 = 21 as shown below. The first and last number of each row, which don't have two numbers above them are 1. <br />

        <h3>Other Algorithm Categories</h3>
        <p>There are ways of categorizing algorithms that aren't about how long they take. Here are two examples.</p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
            <ul>
                <li>An optimization problem is one with the goal of finding the <em>best</em> solution among many (for example...).</li>
                <li>A decision problem is a problem with a true/false answer (for example, "is 5,825,496,221 a prime number?").</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote">
            One reason it's worth learning these categories is to avoid reinventing the wheel. For example, you've learned that if a list is sorted you can search it in sublinear time using binary search. So when you're writing a program that needs to search through a list repeatedly, it's worthwhile to sort the list before searching. Knowing about algorithms that already exist can help you construct new algorithms.
