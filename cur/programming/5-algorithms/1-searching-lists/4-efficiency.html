Compare it to the algorithm you used to count the number of five- or seven-letter words. This block does the same computation as the <code>binary search</code> block, but it uses the linear algorithm.

        <p>
            The actual amount of physical time that it takes to solve a problem depends not only on your algorithm but also on how fast your computer is and what other programs you have running, etc. Therefore, computer scientists who want to measure the speed of an algorithm do it in terms of the number of <em>steps</em>. For example, what we really want to know about the efficiency of the <code>linear search</code> algorithm is how many times <var>current item</var> is compared to <var>value</var> (that is, how many times <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/current-item=value.png" alt="(current item) = (value)" title="(current item) = (value)" /> is called).

                    Add another column to your table. Assuming "zebra" is the <em>last word</em> in each word list, how many comparisons are made by the <code>linear search</code> algorithm for each length list?
