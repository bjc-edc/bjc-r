        <p>Suppose you have a list of items and want to know if the elements of the list are <em>distinct</em> (unique). This kind of question pops up frequently: for example, a Web search engine would want to be sure all of the search results are different from each other.</p>
        <div class="todo">Why are we giving so much away here? Could we yellowbox-hint this? --MF, 9/26/18</div>
        <p>Here is one algorithm to solve the problem:

			Algorithms can be expressed in natural language or in <em>pseudocode</em>, text that describes the steps a program might carry out. These languages for human understanding may help write the algorithm in a programming language.</div>

            	<li><strong>Step 1</strong>. Compare the first item of the list with each of the later items in the list (the second item, the item, etc.). If you see the first item again, report that the numbers <em>are not</em> distinct (<code>false</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2</strong>. If you complete Step 1 without stopping, compare the <em>second</em> item with each of the later items (the third, the, etc.). If you see the second item again, report that the numbers <em>are not</em> distinct (<code>false</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3</strong>. Repeat Step 2 for each number in the list. Compare that item with each of the later items in the in the list.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4.</strong> If you complete Step 3 without finding any duplicates, report that the items <em>are</em> distinct (<code>true</code>).</li>
