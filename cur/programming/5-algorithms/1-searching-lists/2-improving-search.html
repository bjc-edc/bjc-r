        <h2>Is "seperate" spelled correctly?</h2>
        <p>Answering this question is easy in Snap<em>!</em>, because you can just say <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/100000-words-contains-seperate.png" alt="100000-words-contains-seperate.png" title="(100,000 words) contains (seperate)" />. But <em>"easy" doesn't mean fast</em>. The <code>contains</code> block still has to look at each item in the list until it finds the one you are looking for (and says <code>true</code>) or reaches the end of the list (and says <code>false</code>). </p>
        <p>When you are only looking for <em>one</em> thing in a list (for example, checking whether a particular word is spelled correctly) rather than finding <em>all</em> the words with some characteristic (for example, looking for all five-letter words), you can use the strategy from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/1-sorted-lists.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Page 1: Guess My Number to make your algorithm faster.">Page 1: Guess My Number</a> to make your algorithm faster. The best strategy for that problem is a <em>binary search</em> algorithm: always guess the <em>middle</em> value. That way, you eliminate half the possibilities with each guess. We can use a similar strategy to look for a word in the dictionary.</p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Binary Search</strong>
        	<div class="comment">AAP-2.P.1, AAP-2.P.2</div>
            <p>A <strong>binary search</strong> algorithm starts in the middle of a <em>sorted</em> list and repeatedly eliminates half the list until either the desired data is found or all elements have been eliminated.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="endnote">When you see the word "binary" you probably think about ones and zeros. Binary search has nothing to do with that. The word "binary" just means "two," whether it's two digits or two halves.</div>

        <div class="todo">For TG hints: If the number is in the list more than once, any one that you find is ok.</div>
        
        <p>You could have written a simpler number guessing program: the computer could guess the number 1, then 2, then 3, and so on until it finds the number. That would be a <em>linear search</em> algorithm; it's easier to code, but it takes longer to run because every time it makes a wrong guess, it only eliminates only that guess. With binary search,  every wrong guess eliminates <em>half</em> the possibilities at once.</p>

            Mary wants to be sure these ideas are clear:

            <p>In guess my number, you can find the halfway point, by using the average of the two end points, but with a list, you can take the average to find the position of the halfway point, but hen you have to actually look at the value at that position.</p>

            The actual amount of physical time that it takes to solve a problem depends not only on your algorithm but also on how fast your computer is. Therefore, computer scientists who want to measure the speed of an algorithm do it in terms of the number of steps. For example, what we really want to know about binary search is how many times <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/current-item=value.png" alt="(current item) = (value)" title="(current item) = (value)" /> is called.
