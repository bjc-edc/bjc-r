        <p>If you are searching for a number in a <em>sorted</em> list, you have more information. Suppose you have a sorted list and you want to locate the position of a number.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Typically, sorted lists are from lowest to highest. You'll create a block that sorts a list of numbers in Unit 8, <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/8-recursive-reporters/2-sorting/1-sorting-a-list.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F7-recursive-reporters.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Sorting a List">Sorting a List</a>.<div class="todo">Change "a block that sorts a list of numbers" to "a sorting algorithm"? --MF, 3/13/19</div></div>

            <div><span>Alphie: </span> If the list is sorted, we could look at the  middle element of the list and see if our number is in the first or last half of the list. That would save time.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> This feels a lot like the guessing game we built&mdash;I pick a number and the computer tries to guess it by splitting the list in half with each guess.</div>

			<div>
                <span>Alphie: </span> But in that one, the computer guessed a number that we picked.  Now we want it to find a number in a list and report its position. It should work like this:<br />
