		<h2>Analyzing and Improving Searches</h2>
        <!--I cut this because: 1) it isn't buyable as a motivation for coding because it reads like it's about a standard contact list app that comes with any phone, 2) it's confusing because the last line is about writing an app to do what Alphie's already said they need to do by sight, and 3) it's irrelevant because they write a program to search a 1-dim list not 2-plus-dim list. --MF 1/6/17

            <div><span>Alphie: </span> Yeah, but there are so many numbers. It's really hard to find.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> Did you assign Gamal as a contact? If you did, then just look through your contacts. That's a lot easier, because it's in order.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie: </span> Well, no, it's not in order. I added new people to my contact list when I learned their number. I'll have to sort it some day and change my <strong>new contact</strong> program to put new numbers where they belong, alphabetically.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> Oh. Well, then I think the best you can do for now is to write a program that starts at the beginning and looks for Gamal. </div>

        <p>If you are searching for a number in a <em>sorted</em> list, you have more information. Suppose you have a sorted list and you want to locate the position of a number.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Typically, sorted lists are from lowest to highest. You'll create a <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/8-recursive-reporters/2-sorting/1-sorting-a-list.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F7-recursive-reporters.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">block that sorts a list of numbers in Unit 7</a>.</div>
    
        <div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>Alphie: </span> If the list is sorted, we could look at the  middle element of the list and see if our number is in the first or last half of the list. That would save time.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> This feels a lot like the guessing game we built&mdash;I pick a number and the computer tries to guess it by splitting the list in half with each guess.</div>

                <span>Alphie: </span> But in that one, the computer guessed a number that we picked.  Now we want it to find a number in a list <!--that it knows (because we tell it)--> and report its position.  It should work like this:<br />
