            <div><span>Alphie: </span> Yeah, but there are so many numbers. It's really hard to find.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> Did you assign Gamal as a contact? If you did, then just look through your contacts. That's a lot easier, because it's in order.</div>
            <div><span>Alphie: </span> Well, no, it's not in order. I added new people to my contact list when I learned their number. I'll have to sort it some day and change my <strong>new contact</strong> program to put new numbers where they belong, alphabetically.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> Oh. Well, then I think the best you can do for now is to write a program that starts at the beginning and looks for Gamal. </div>

        <h3>Searching in Unsorted Data</h3>
        <p>Searching for an item in <em>unsorted</em> data is less efficient because you have to check every item, but it is easier to code.</p>

                <li> 	       
                    Build a <code>position of number in unsorted list</code> block  that reports the earliest location of a number in an unsorted list or reports "Not In List" (or NIL, if you like) if the number is not in the list.<br />

        <h3>Searching in Sorted Data</h3>
        <p>If you are searching for a number in a <em>sorted</em> list, you have more information. Suppose you have a sorted list and you want to locate the position of a number.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Typically, sorted lists are from lowest to highest. You'll create a block that sorts a list of numbers in Unit 8, <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/8-recursive-reporters/2-sorting/1-sorting-a-list.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F7-recursive-reporters.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Sorting a List">Sorting a List</a>.</div>
    
        <div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>Alphie: </span> If the list is sorted, we could look at the  middle element of the list and see if our number is in the first or last half of the list. That would save time.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy: </span> This feels a lot like the guessing game we built&mdash;I pick a number and the computer tries to guess it by splitting the list in half with each guess.</div>

                <span>Alphie: </span> But in that one, the computer guessed a number that we picked.  Now we want it to find a number in a list <!--that it knows (because we tell it)--> and report its position.  It should work like this:<br />

            <p>Both <code>position in sorted list</code> and the number guesser algorithm can be built with the same <em>binary search</em> algorithm. How does this connect to the use of the word <em>binary</em> in Unit 4?</p>
            <p>Note: In the binary search it's okay to find the position of any copy of a duplicated value.  (Although if for some reason it were important to find the first copy, you could do the binary search and then look leftward in the list until you find some unequal value.)</p>

                <li>Using the strategy of your guessing game project from the previous page, write a block that says:
