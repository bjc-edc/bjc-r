        <p>You can classify algorithms by the amount of time they take to run. <!--To classify an algorithm, you look at the number of steps it takes to complete the algorithm and compare it to the size of the input. For example, <code>25,000 integers</code> takes <em>constant time:</em> computing 25,000 integers starting at seven takes as long as computing 25,000 integers starting at seven million. As a second example, <code>linear search</code> takes <em>linear time:</em> if you have ten times as many words in the dictionary, then it takes ten times as long to search through them all. As a third example, consider the <code>sort</code> algorithm you timed. It takes <em>quadratic time:</em> multiplying the input size by ten multiplies the time required by 10<sup>2</sup>. As another example, consider the <code>binary search</code> algorithm you timed. In binary search, multiplying the input size by ten <em>adds</em> a constant amount to the time required instead of multiplying by a constant amount. This is an example of <em>sublinear time</em>.--></p>

        <div class="vocabBig">
            <ul>
                <li>An algorithm takes <strong>linear time</strong> the number of steps is proportional to the input size; doubling the input size doubles the time required.</li>
                <li>An algorithm takes <strong>sublinear time</strong> if the number of steps grows more slowly than the size.</li>
                <li>An algorithm takes <strong>constant time</strong> if it takes the same number of steps regardless of input size.</li>

        <p>The difference between linear search and binary search can be very important if you're searching in a list of ten million items, but the <em>most</em> important difference in algorithm efficiency is between polynomial time (proportional to any power of the input size) and exponential time.</p>

        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    An algorithm takes <strong>polynomial time</strong> if the number of steps is less than or equal to a power of the size of the input, such as constant (<em>n</em><sup>0</sup>), sublinear, linear (<em>n</em><sup>1</sup>), quadratic (<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>), or cubic (<em>n</em><sup>3</sup>).

                </li>
                <li>
                    An algorithm takes <strong>exponential time</strong> if the number of steps is proportional to an exponential function of the size of the input, such as 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>, 10<sup><em>n</em></sup>, etc., which is much slower than any polynomial.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>In an exponential time algorithm, just <em>adding 1</em> to the input size (<em>n</em>) of a 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> time algorithm <em>doubles</em> the number of steps! So, for example, if the input size is 20, <em>any</em> polynomial time algorithm will be fast enough, but an exponential time algorithm might take many <em>years</em> to finish.</p>

        <p>One reason it's worth learning these categories is to avoid reinventing the wheel. For example, you've learned that if a list is sorted you can search it in sublinear time using binary search. So when you're writing a program that needs to search through a list repeatedly, it's worthwhile to sort the list before searching. Knowing about algorithms that already exist can help you construct new algorithms.</p>

        <p>All of the algorithms you've explored so far in this lab (<code>linear search</code>; <code>binary search</code>; <code>25,000 integers</code>; and <code>sort</code>) are reasonable time algorithms. The following optional activity is an example of an exponential time algorithm.</p>
        <div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="9">
				<p>A problem that may be familiar that requires an exponential time algorithm is computing any given element of Pascal's Triangle. In Pascal's Triangle, each number is found by adding the two numbers above it. For example, 4 + 6 = 10 and 15 + 6 = 21 as shown below. The first and last number of each row, which don't have two numbers above them are 1. <br />

                                As the population size is multiplied by 10, the time needed for entering data is also multiplied by 10, so for a population of 1,000,000, it should take about 10&times;200=2000 hours.

                                As the population size is multiplied by 10, time needed for backing up data is multiplied by 10, so for a population of 1,000,000, it should take about 10&times;50=500 hours.

                                Correct! <!--Sorting the data seems to go up exponentially as the the population grows. For a population of 1,000,000, it should take about 10,000 hours.-->  As the population size is multiplied by 10, the time needed for the sorting of data is multiplied by 100.  So, for a population of 1,000,000, it should take about 100&times;100=10,000 hours.
