    	<h2>Getting Started: Revisiting the Number-Guessing Game</h2>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
            	<li> In Unit 2, you built a number guessing game in which the computer picked a number, you guessed, and it told you whether your guess was too high, too low, or just right.  One simple version of that game is shown below. Click on the image to load that file.
                <p><a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/5-algorithms/U5L1-GuessNumber.xml"> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/U5L1-guessNumber.png" alt="starting script for a number guessing game"> </a></p>
                </li>
                <li>Play the game a few times and keep track of how many guesses it took you to guess the computer's secret number.</li>
                
            </ol>
            <div class="dialogue">
                <div><span>Alphie: </span> The best I did was 12 guesses.</div>
                <div><span>Betsy: </span> It got it in 4 guesses once. I think that's the best you can do.</div>
                <div><span>Gamal: </span> If you were <em>really</em> lucky, you could have gotten it in one guess.  Maybe your 4 is luck, too!</div>
                <div><span>Betsy: </span> But I have a strategy.</div>
                <div><span>Gamal: </span> You have a strategy that will always work in 4 guesses?!</div>
                <div><span>Betsy: </span> Not always 4, but  always a lot less than 12.</div>
			</div>
            <ol start="3">
            	<li>What strategy gives you the best you can do? Describe your strategy clearly and precisely enough for your pair programmer to use it in playing the game.</li>
                <li>With your partner, build a program that uses your strategy to guess someone's secret number. </li>
            </ol>
