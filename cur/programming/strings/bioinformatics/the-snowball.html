            Now for the big part of the algorithm!
            Write a block <b>combine strings</b>, that takes in a list of strings and returns
            a single string that combines the list in a specific way:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                First, your block will search through the list to identify the two
                strings with the most overlap.
            </li>
            <li>
                Throw out the two strings you found and combine these two strings into their
                shortest superstring.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now, the process should be repeated with the superstring and the list of
                original strings that were not selected in the first step.  This list will have one
                less string than in the first step.
            </li>
            <li>
                When there is only one string left, it should be reported.
            </li>
        </ol>
