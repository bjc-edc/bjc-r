            You've completed an algorithm that will combine many strings in linear time!

            Unfortunately, while this has many parallels to the types of algorithm used in practice,
            this is somewhat of an oversimplification of the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a group, discuss some pros and cons of this model of genomic sequencing,
            in terms of capturing
            it as a shortest superstring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, think about the pros and cons of the algorithm to solve the shortest superstring
            problem.
