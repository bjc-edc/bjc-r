	    &#40;1&#41; The first block we made in <span class="snap">snap</span> was the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/prob/polyblock.png" alt="poly-block"/> block. Let&#8217;s try to recreate it in Python!
	</p>

	<p>
	    Note: remember that Python doesn&#8217;t have a &quot;repeat&quot; like <span class="snap">snap</span>. What could you use instead?
	</p>

	<p>
	    &#40;2&#41; A more advanced block we made in <span class="snap">snap</span> was the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/draw-square-leaved-flower-empty-paramters.png" alt="draw-square-leaved-flower-empty-paramters"/> block. Can you write the same block in Python?
	</p>

	<p>
	    &#40;3&#41; Ready for a challenge? You can do recursion in Python too! Use the same ideas we used to make fractals in <span class="snap">snap</span> to build one in Python!
