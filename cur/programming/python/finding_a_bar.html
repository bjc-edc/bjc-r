    		Now it's time to seriously write some code.  Start by right clicking on this <a href="">link</a> and select save as.  Make sure to save this file to the PythonLab1 directory that we made earlier.  Head back to the shell and enter the <code>ls</code> command to make sure that the file made it into our PythonLab1 directory.
    	</p>
    	<p><pre><code>
Alonzos-Macbook:PythonLab1 alonzo$ ls
virus.py
		</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			First, take a look inside the virus.py file.  We will be editing the python file in something called a text editor (guess what a text editor does...).  There are many text editors available, (NotePad++, Emacs, Xcode, etc.) but in this lab we'll be using SublimeText 3.
		</p>
		<p class="alert quoteOrange">
			Open up sublime and then open virus.py.  Make sure to read the comments at the top of the file and then take a brief glance at the code, but don't worry about it too much for right now. Also, make sure to set the variable called your_name just below the comments.  For example, your_name = "alonzo" (make sure your name is inside quotes as this is how Python designates text).
		</p>
		<p>
			Head back to the shell and you can try running this file by entering <code>python3 virus.py</code> as shown below:
		</p>
    	<p><pre><code>
Alonzos-Macbook:PythonLab1 alonzo$ python3 virus.py
		</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			Next try running the first exercise by entering <code>python3 virus.py first_even_nums 5</code> (if it's working this should print the first 5 even numbers, starting with the number 2):
		</p>
		<p><pre><code>
Alonzos-Macbook:PythonLab1 alonzo$ python3 virus.py first_even_nums 5
2
4
6
8
		</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			Uh oh...it looks like we've only printed the first 4 even numbers. Head back to sublime and edit the function called "first_even_nums" so that we get the correct behavior:
		</p>
				<p><pre><code>
Alonzos-Macbook:PythonLab1 alonzo$ python3 virus.py first_even_nums 5
2
4
6
8
10
		</code></pre></p>

			On the next page you'll learn how to define functions of your own!
