      		There are <b>two</b> parts to a function, the "head" and the "body".<br><br>
      		<b>PART ONE: HEAD</b>
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  		To define a function in Python, you first need to make a head. It generally looks like this:
			<code>    def function_name():    </code>
			Try making a sum function, which will add two numbers (x and y) and output their sum. 
			Start with a "def statement" (underlined).
			    <code style="text-decoration: underline">def</code><code> function_name():</code>    
			"def" is the first thing we write when defining a function. We always write "def". It is Python's way of saying how the following function will be defined. This is analogous to <img src="../../../../img/python/makeablock.png" alt="make a block"/> button in <span class="snap">snap</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			You can choose almost any function name you want. We could have used "add" or "add_two_numbers", or something else. Note the space between the "def" and the function name. That one space is <em><b>essential</b></em> to the syntax. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Our function will have two parameters, x and y. You can make a function with as many or as little parameters as you want. We start by opening a parenthesis following the function name. Then, name your variables, and separate them with a comma and possibly a space, although spaces are not necessary in separation. Close your parameters with a closing parenthesis.<br><br>For a function with zero parameters, just use an opening and closing pair of parentheses like this: ()
		</p>
		<p>
			The final part of the head is the colon. It immediately follows the parameters, and distinguishes the end of your function head. You <em><b>must</b></em> have this colon at the end of the head. So, the final result of the head of our function will look something like this:<br><code>    def sum(x, y):    </code>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>PART TWO: BODY</b><br><br>
			Now we need to write the "body" of the function. Just like in <span class="snap">snap</span> you can fill in the body with pretty much anything: loops, conditionals (if/else), variables, even other function definitions, and more. <br><br>

			The most important thing to do when starting off the body is indenting (4 spaces or 1 tab).	<br>
			Then, begin writing your code. Go ahead and fill in the rest of the line. So, we have something like this:<br>

			<pre><code>    
		def sum(x, y):
			return x + y
			    </code></pre>

			Return ends our function (as we learned previously), and outputs the value that follows. So in this case, the function returns x + y. If the function reaches a return statement, then no lines below it will be executed. The current sum function is very simple, try writing sum with a temporary variable, called total.
