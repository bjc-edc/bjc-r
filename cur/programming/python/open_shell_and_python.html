    	<p class="alert alert-danger">
    		This section provides information regarding how to run python and use a shell on your computer.  We've done our best to provide information for all major operating systems (although it's easier on some systems than on others).
    	</p>
    	<h3>On Mac OSX:</h3>
    	<p>
    		The Terminal Window is like a text-based version of your computer. From here, many common actions, like creating or navigating folders and launching applications, can be performed via the command line. On Mac and Linux the Terminal application can be accessed from the Applications folder or using a quick-search function.  Look for this image:

    	<h3>On Windows</h3>
    	<p>
    		Windows also has an interface similar to the terminal, but it is called the CMD command line.  Do a search for for cmd.exe on your computer.  If you are unable to get python to work from the command line (as explained below) here is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/faq/windows.html" target="_blank">link</a> that will help you get things set up.

    	<h3>Running Python</h3>
    	<p>
    		The next step is to open the python "interpreter". On the command line type <code>python3</code> and hit the <code>Enter</code> key. The "3" indicates the version of python we will be using in this lab.  You should see something similar to the following:
    	</p>
    	<p><pre><code>
Alonzos-Macbook:~ alonzo$ python3
Python 3.4.0 (v3.4.0:04f714765c13, Month DD YYYY, HH:MM:SS) 
[GCC X.X.X] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
		</code></pre></p>
		<p class="alert quoteBlue">
		[Note: The version of python being used in this lab is Python 3.4]
		</p>
		<p>
			The <code>>>></code> indicates where to enter python code. After typing a line of code, hitting the <code>Enter</code> key will tell the python interpreter to run the instruction.  Try typing the following into the interpreter:
		</p>
		<p><pre><code>
>>> 3 + 5
8
		</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			If the text cursor is on a line beginning with <code>>>></code>, the terminal window has an active python interpreter open. From here you won't be able to run any unix command. To leave the python interpreter type the exit command <code>exit()</code> and hit the <code>Enter</code> key.
		<p><pre><code>
>>> exit()
Alonzos-Macbook:~ alonzo$
		</code></pre></p>
		<p>
			Any functions or variables created in the python interpreter are erased when the <code>exit()</code> command is run.
		</p>
