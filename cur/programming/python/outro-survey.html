        <p>This survey is to get some feedback about how everyone feels about this data science module. Since this is a new unit this semester, with what we like to believe is a more engaging approach pulling from contemporary culture, your feedback is very needed! It's going to be worth a small amount of extra credit if you're willing to put your name at the end.</p>
