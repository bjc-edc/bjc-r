        	Welcome to Besides Blocks Lab 1: An Introduction to Python

    	<p>
    		<span class="snap">Snap</span> is a graphical programming language ("click and drag", "drag and drop", "snapping" blocks together). Most other programming languages, such as python, are text based, which means that you must type out your code. In this lab, you will get to practice writing python in the interpreter and in a text file.  We'll talk about the differences between these two formats later in the lab.

    	<p class="alert quoteGreen">
    		<b>Syntax</b> refers to the way in which code must be organized for the machine to execute it predictably and properly. In <span class="snap">snap</span>, this is determined by things like the shapes of blocks. <span class="snap">Snap</span> and all other languages enforce syntax to prevent basic errors when we run our code.
    	</p>
    	<br>
    	<p>
    		Python also has syntax rules for arranging code that are different from those found in <span class="snap">snap</span>. The major objectives of this lab are to get you to practice writing in python's syntax and to be aware of how to approach problems in a new way, while still implementing background knowledge of computer science concepts. For example let&#8217s take a look at this simple max function in Python:
    	<p>
    	<br>
    	<table style="width:80%">
	  			<tr>
	  				<td>
	  					<img src="/bjc-r/img/python/max.png" alt="max function"/>
	  				</td>
	  				<td>
<pre><code><blockquote>
	def max(x, y):
		if (x > y):
			return x
		else:
			return y
</blockquote></code></pre>
					</td>
	  			</tr>
	  		</table>
	    <p>
	    	Look at how similar these two functions are! The code is practically identical, line by line, only with Python's syntax.
	    </p>
	    <br>
	    <p class="alert quoteBlue">    	
			You will see python code side by side with snap code throughout this lab because, although you may not believe it, anything that can be built in snap can also be created in python and vice versa.  This process is called <b>codification</b> and allows us to map one language to another, as long as we make sure to translate according to each languages&#8217 unique syntax.
