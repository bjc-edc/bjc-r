<!--ORIGINAL NAME: Your first MapReduce : a simple sum-of-squares (we did it for you)-->
</head><body>
<ul>

  <li>We are going to start by showing you how we do a really easy one,
and work up to some hard ones. This problem involves finding the sum of
squares of some numbers. E.g., 1<sup>2</sup> + 20<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>
+ 10<sup>2</sup> = 510 (nice area code, eh?)</li>
</ul>

<table border="1" width="100%">

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Problem</th>
      <th scope="col">Input</th>
      <th scope="col">Map Domain</th>
      <th scope="col">Map Range</th>
      <th scope="col">Map Function</th>
      <th scope="col">Binary reducer function</th>
      <th scope="col">Output</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">A sum of squares of numbers</td>
      <td align="center">numbers, each one a different list element</td>
      <td align="center">number</td>
      <td align="center">number</td>
      <td align="center">square</td>
      <td align="center">+</td>
      <td align="center">a single number</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>...and here is what it looks like when we do it: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/map-reduce-sum-of-squares-snap.png" alt="Sum-of-squares MapReduce" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/SumOfSquaresMR.png"></p>

Let's note a couple things:
<ul>

  <li>The mapper should take a single number as input, but what we have
used for simplicity is just the <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/multiply-block-snap.png" alt="Multiply" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Multiply.gif">
block, which has two inputs. You also recall that <span class="snap">snap</span> , given a
function of two inputs but with only one input (each element in Map's
input list in this case) will just copy the input to all the fields,
making it a nice, effective square procedure.</li>
  <li>As we go through more detailed examples, we are going to want to
write a <em>mapper</em> and <em>reducer</em> funtions as separate and
defined blocks, so for good code management, we are going to define one
sprite per MapReduce problem, each of which has a <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/mapper-block-snap.png" alt="mapper" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/mapper.gif">
and <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/reducer-block-snap.png" alt="reducer" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/reducer.gif">,
with the answers already filled in. Once you understand what the
problem is, first edit the <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/mapper-block-snap.png" alt="mapper" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/mapper.gif">
block, delete its body, and see if you can recreate it. Once you have
got a working <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/mapper-block-snap.png" alt="mapper" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/mapper.gif">,
do the same with the <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/reducer-block-snap.png" alt="reducer" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/reducer.gif">.
That way, you will always have a working system. Note that we have
written a lot of helper functions to make your life easier. Feel free
to use the <code>Scripts</code> area of each sprite for debugging.
When you are done with each of these, compare your answer with ours.</li>
