  <title>Extra for Experience : the fifth MapReduce ... Google, building a
Google-like index</title>


<!--ORIGINAL NAME: Extra for Experience : the fifth MapReduce ... Google, building a Google-like index-->
</head><body>
<p> The idea here is that you have a huge set of webpages (URLs) and
webpage-content, and you want to create a huge table indexed by each
word that shows you what URL the word is in. Fill in the body for the <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/mapper-block-snap.png" alt="mapper" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/mapper.gif">
and <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/reducer-block-snap.png" alt="reducer" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/reducer.gif">
for the <code> Google</code> sprite and test it. <em>Hint: This
problem is very similar to WordCount</em>. </p>

      <td align="center">Google simulation! Given web pages (URLs) and
data, create a massive reverse-lookup-table, that allows us to quickly
query, given any single word, what webpages it was on.</td>
      <td align="center">The input is a list of lists. The first
element in each inner list is the web page address, the second element
is the content of the webpage</td>
      <td align="center">Two-element list, the web page address and the
text of the web page</td>
      <td align="center">A list of lists, where the inner list has the
word as the first element and all the URLs that have the word as
followup elements. e.g., if the input were: <code>("hamlet" "to be or
not to be")</code>, the output would be <code>((to hamlet) (be hamlet)
(or hamlet) (not hamlet))</code></td>
      <td align="center">For every unique word in the webpage, make a
list of the word and the URL. Return a list of all these pairs.</td>
      <td align="center">Take two lists of words and their counts and
merge them. E.g., Given <code>((to hamlet) (be hamlet) (or hamlet) (not
hamlet))</code> and <code>((to webster) (wit webster))</code>, it
would return <code>((to hamlet webster) (be hamlet) (or hamlet) (not
hamlet) (wit webster))</code></td>
      <td align="center">A single list of lists, with each inner list a
unique word as the first element and the URLs that contain the word as
the following elements.</td>
