<p>Hopefully that last one was not too bad. This one is a little harder
because you have to write both the mapper and reducer. The idea is that
you have a huge set of data and you need to keep only the ones that
match. Fill in the body for the <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/mapper-block-snap.png" alt="mapper" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/mapper.gif">
and <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/reducer-block-snap.png" alt="reducer" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/reducer.gif">
for the <code> Love</code> sprite and test it.</p>

there, return title as a one-element list, otherwise return the empty
list</td>
