        <ul>
            <li>
Distributed computing is a field where many computers (often
geographically remote) are used to solve a single problem. <ul>
                    <li> As you can imagine,
the mechanisms of this are quite complicated. Traditionally,
distributed programming has been difficult (at least compared to
programming on a single computer with one core). </li>
                    <li> The scientific
community deeply cares&nbsp; about this issue because they often have
so many computations that can only be done in a distributed way (e.g.
simulating climate change). Very early distributed computing
applications were all scientific in nature. </li>
                    <li>
                        More recently, <em>every</em>
field has large datasets and computing jobs, from entertainment (Pixar
rendering a frame from their latest movie) to medicine (protein
folding), to finance (running simulations of a new purchasing strategy
on all historic stock exchange data) to artificial intelligence
(solving checkers), and to business (Google needing to crawl and index
and search the web). </li>
                    <li>
                        Languages and tools and abstractions have improved greatly for distributed computations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the end of the day, <em>Amdahl's law</em>
tells us that in the perfect world, if we distribute the problem across
N machines, we can solve the problem N times faster. However, it will
be hard to get that level of speed-up because of serial fraction of
code. Still, if N is on the order of a million and coders make every
effort to reduce the serial fraction, that is a pretty fast system! </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Common <em>patterns</em> have emerged (i.e. the best ways) to approach problems with computational resources which might be geographically distant.
            </li>
            <li>
                One of these patterns is <em>MapReduce</em>, which has emerged as a remarkable abstraction for dealing with the difficulties of distributed computing.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Researchers at Google wrote the seminal paper on it, and they use it extensively to take advantage of
                        their massive datacenters to help them with their massive data needs. In our simplification of the
                        process --
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is a <strong>Map</strong> phase where (sometimes very big) data is broken up into pieces and sent to machines with a <em>mapping function</em>.
Sometimes the mapping function is the identity (i.e. do nothing)
function; take what is sent in and return it. The output of the mapper
is the same as the input of the reducers. In our simplifying
abstraction, the mapping happens over a list of elements, which can be
of any type (word, sentence, list, procedure, etc.). </li>
                    <li>
                        There is a <strong>Reduce</strong> phase where all the results of the mappers are combined into one using a <em>reducing function</em>,
which takes two adjacent pairs and replaces those values with the
reduction of those two values. This process continues until there is
only one element left. </li>
                    <li> Note that the
outputs of reductions are sent as input to other reducers, so in our
simplifying abstraction, there are only two data types: <ol>
                            <li>
                                The data type used in the list of input to the mappers. In the tables below, the <b>Input</b> is a list of this type. (e.g., if the input is a <i>number</i>, then the input to the MapReduce is a list of <i>numbers</i>.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The data type that is the output of the reducers, shown as <b>Output</b>
below, is the reported value of the entire MapReduce process. In this
simplified model, this type is the same as the output of the mappers,
which is the same as the input to the reducers. </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
Another way to think about it -- what if the original list were of
length 1? The mapper would do its job, and return something. But, since
it is the only mapper needed, its output has to match the desired
output of the MapReduce call, so every mapper always has to return the
same output (type, formatting, etc.) as is desired (from the result of
the reducing phase). </li>
                    <li>
                        Here is the most important part of this, so read the following over a few times so you understand: <strong>Thanks
to Abstraction, running a MapReduce on your computer should be
indistinguishable from running MapReduce on a cluster of a million
computers (except hopefully the latter is faster). You do not need to
worry about that when you are writing your MapReduce code. So for this
lab, we are going to make sure you understand how to write MapReduce
programs for one computer, and later when <span class="snap">snap</span>  allows us to easily
support automated, distributed computing, the internals of MapReduce
will change to send your program to a cluster, but your programs will
not have to!</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
How does it work? It is exactly as we describe -- we send the results
of mapping over a list to a reducer (block interface and definition
shown below). </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
