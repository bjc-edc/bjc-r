    	<h2>Pornography (Teacher's Choice)</h2>
                <p><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/teachers-choice.png" alt="Teacher's Choice" title="Teacher's Choice" /></p>
    <p>Don't worry, we're not going to send you to any porn sites.</p>
        <h3>Pornography is special in the law.</h3>
        <p>Remember the &quot;imminent action&quot; standard for government regulation of speech? Pornography is the only exception to that. Courts have ruled that pornographic speech is harmful in itself, whether or not it incites to imminent action.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Write down three arguments in favor of treating pornography as harmful in itself, and three arguments against.</li>
                <li>In groups of four, discuss your arguments. Do you think pornography should be forbidden?</li>
                <li>Also discuss how a court should decide whether something is pornographic.</li>
            </ol>

    <h3>A Case Study</h3>
    <p><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/Sanger.jpg" width="110" alt="Margaret Sanger"></p>
    <p>Margaret Sanger (1879‒1966)
	was a pioneer in providing information about birth control to women in the US. She was a founder of the American Birth Control League, which eventually became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
    <p>In 1914, she was prosecuted for her book <em>Family Limitation,</em> which was considered obscene because it explained birth control techniques.        
    <div class="forYouToDo">
        <ol start="4">
    <li>Today, providing birth control information is legal.  In 1914, it wasn't.         What changed?  Discuss.</li>
    <li>Who was the law trying to protect, in 1914?</li></ol></div>
      <h3>Protecting Children</h3>
      <p>Another way in which pornography is special in the law is that adults and children are treated differently. Today, in most places, adults are allowed to read whatever they want, but not children.</p>
      <p>Before the Internet, it was relatively easy for a distributor of pornography to distinguish between children and adults, because the buyer was physically in front of the seller.</p>
    <div class="forYouToDo">
        <ol start="6"> 
        <li>Think of a way to determine over the net whether someone is over 18, or over 21.  (Standards differ in different places.)  How do you prevent someone lying about his or her age?</li></ol></div> 
      <p>Several attempts at outlawing pornography for children have been rejected by the Supreme Court on the grounds that the proposed laws would also end up restricting what's available to adults.</p> <h4>Pornography Using Children</h4>
    <p>One thing that pretty much everyone agrees on is that it's harmfully exploitative to use children as <em>actors</em> in pornographic images or video.  If there's anything in this topic that's not controversial, it's that.      
    <p>But computers have muddied even this issue.  It's now possible to produce images of children without any real children involved:
      <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/baby.gif" alt="dancing baby"></p>
      <p>(Animation © 1996 Autodesk.)
      <p>That animation was entirely computer-generated from abstract digital models of human motion capabilities; no actual person was filmed. And the technology has gotten much better since 1996; today's movies have very convincing aliens or talking animals.      
      <p>Current laws deal with this complication by outlawing any pornographic image that <em>appears</em> to involve children.  But if a distributor could prove that the image was created digitally, who does this law protect?</p>
