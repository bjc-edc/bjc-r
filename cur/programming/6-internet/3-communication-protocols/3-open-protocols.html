		<h2>A Hierarchy of Open Protocols</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            2.2.3D In an abstraction hierarchy, higher levels of abstraction (the most general concepts) would be placed toward the top and lower level abstractions (the more specific concepts) toward the bottom.<br />
            <strong>6.1</strong> The Internet is a network of autonomous systems.<br />
            <strong>6.1.1</strong> Explain the abstractions in the Internet and how the Internet functions. [P3] <em>Exclusion Statement (LO 6.1.1): Specific devices used to implement the abstractions in the Internet are beyond the scope of this course and the AP Exam.</em><br />
            6.1.1E Connecting new devices to the Internet is enabled by assignment of an Internet protocol (IP) address.<br />
            6.1.1F The Internet is built on evolving standards, including those for addresses and names.<br />
            6.1.1H The number of devices that could use an IP address has grown so fast that a new protocol (IPv6) has been established to handle routing of many more devices.<br />
            <strong>6.2</strong> Characteristics of the Internet influence the systems built on it.<br />
            <strong>6.2.2</strong> Explain how the characteristics of the Internet influence the systems built on it. [P4]<br />
            6.2.2B The redundancy of routing (i.e., more than one way to route data) between two points on the Internet increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.<br />
            6.2.2D Interfaces and protocols enable widespread use of the Internet.<br />
            6.2.2E Open standards fuel the growth of the Internet.<br />
            6.2.2F The Internet is a packet-switched system through which digital data is sent by breaking the data into blocks of bits called packets, which contain both the data being transmitted and control information for routing the data.<br />
            6.2.2G Standards for packets and routing include transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP).<br />
            6.3.1M Certificate authorities (CAs) issue digital certificates that validate the ownership of encrypted keys used in secured communication and are based on a trust model.<br />

        <p>There are billions of devices connected to the Internet, and hundreds of different <em>kinds</em> of devices: laptops, tablets, phones, refrigerators, handheld credit card readers, and so on. How do they all know how to find and talk to each other? <strong>Protocols</strong> (standards) ensure that the variety of devices interact with each other smoothly.</p>
        <p>There are a <em>lot</em> of protocols! The Internet was designed with several layers of <em>abstraction</em> that sort the protocols according to what part of the process they support. </p>


		<h3>Internet Abstraction Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>This <em>hierarchy of abstractions</em> manages the complexity of the Internet by hiding the details of lower levels of the system. The highest level of abstraction includes the most general features of the Internet that have to work the same across all devices. At lowers levels of abstraction, things get more device-specific. </p>	
        <div class="sidenoteBig">Application Layer Examples: browsers use <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-internet/2-reliable-communication/1-what-is-internet.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">HTTP</a> (HyperText Transfer Protocol) to interpret HTML instructions for page formatting. <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-internet/2-reliable-communication/3-address-hierarchy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">DNS</a> (Domain Name System) converts user-friendly web addresses into IP addresses. Your email inbox may  use SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send  and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) to read  email.</div>									
        <div class="sidenoteBig">Transport Layer Examples: <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-internet/3-communication-protocols/2-tcp.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">TCP</a> (Transmission Control Protocol) <em>simulates</em> a reliable, long-term connection between two computers by only displaying data once all packets have arrived. When speed  is more important than accuracy, people use UDP (User Datagram Protocol), such as for  real-time video streaming, where one missed packet doesn't matter much.</div>
        <div class="sidenoteBig">Internet Layer Examples: Every device on the Internet needs an IP address so other devices can find it.  <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-internet/3-communication-protocols/1-ip.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">IP</a> (Internet Protocol) addresses are upgrading from IPv4 to IPv6. Routers use Internet layer protocols to detect and work around network congestion.</div>
        <div class="sidenoteBig">Link Layer Examples: You may connect with an <em>Ethernet</em> cable perhaps a<em>WiFi</em> radio antenna inside the case. Both connects computers to a local network router which then connects to an Internet provider. Cell phones use a longer-range <em>cellular</em> connection to a phone carrier. </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Layer Protocols</strong> are the highest level of abstraction because they<em> manage how data is interpreted and displayed</em> to users. These protocols <em>give meaning to the bits</em> sent by lower-level protocols; user and server computers must agree on what the bits mean, and application protocols (like HTTP) offer this.</li>
                <li><strong>Transport Layer Protocols</strong> manage the <em>breakdown  of a message into packets</em> to be transmitted by lower level protocols and also the  <em>reconstruction of the message from the packets</em> upon arrival.</li>

                <li><strong>Internet Layer Protocols</strong> <em>manage the pathways that the data packets travel</em> across networks. These protocols treat the Internet like one large network even though the physical reality on the lower level is one of many tiny subnetworks.</li>
                <li><strong>Network Interface Hardware</strong> (Link Layer): All Internet devices connect through a <em>physical interface that uses a protocol to manage the connection</em> to the local network. These local protocols are the least abstract because they deal directly with your physical hardware.</li>
            </ul>
		</div>


        <h3>Open Protocols</h3>	
        <div class="sidenoteBig">Before the Internet, there were several different network protocols that were secrets belonging to particular manufacturers. So if you had a particular brand of computer or router, it could talk only to other computers of the same brand.</div>
		<p>These are all <strong>open standards</strong> meaning that anyone can look up a protocol and code with it to make new hardware or software without any permission. The Internet is probably the largest and most complicated artifact in human history, and it relies on <strong>cooperation!</strong> Despite some governments' attempts to censor the net, the big picture is one of strong cooperative spirit.</p>
		<div class="endnote">
        	Just think...
            <ul>
                <li>Your T-Mobile cell phone can talk to your friend's Verizon phone.</li>
            	<li>You can send email to someone in a country that's considered an enemy of your country (from the US to Iran, for example).</li>
                <li>An engineer at Microsoft can read a web page at Apple even though their companies are competitors.</li>

        <p>Your network interface connects you to a small <strong>local network</strong>.  If your connection is by Ethernet (physical cable), the local network is all the machines that are cabled together, typically all in one or two rooms.  If the computers in your lab are permanently installed, the odds are they're on an Ethernet.  If you're on a laptop, your local network consists of all the machines with WiFi connections to the same router, also typically very near each other.</p>
        <p>Somewhere on your local network is a device that's <em>also</em> connected to <em>another</em> network.  That other network isn't "the Internet"; it's a somewhat larger network, but still pretty small.  Maybe there's one such network for your entire school.  The <strong>routers</strong> are the machines that are connected to two or more networks, your local one and some wider area ones.  It's a "router" because its job is to route incoming messages to the particular local computer to which each message is addressed.  It also knows how to forward outgoing messages to the best available larger network.</p>
		<p>So, does your message finally get onto a super-huge network called "the Internet"?  No; all of the networks together, even the local net in your house, make up the Internet.  It's called "<strong>Internet</strong>" because it's a <em>network of networks</em>.</p>
		<p>The network hardware interface attached to your computer only knows how to send messages to other computers on your local network.  When you ask for a web site on the other side of the world, as far as the hardware is concerned, you're just sending your request to your local router.  The router has to forward your message to <em>its</em> router, and so on, until you reach a router that's on <em>several</em> large networks and has to figure out which one is best for the next step in getting your request to its final destination.  The rules by which routers know how to do that are the <strong>Internet Protocol.</strong>  It's the abstraction that lets you imagine you're on a single huge network with all of the other computers in the world.</p>
