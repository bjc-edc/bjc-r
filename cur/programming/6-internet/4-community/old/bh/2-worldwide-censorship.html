    	<h2>Worldwide Censorship</h2>
    	<p>During World War II, the National Socialist (Nazi) government in Germany killed 17 million people, including 6 million Jews. They did this because they believed white Germanic (&quot;Aryan&quot;) people were superior to other people, and they wanted to &quot;purify&quot; their society by eliminating supposedly lesser races.</p>
    	<p>The Nazis initially came into power in Germany through a true democratic election, although once in power they took action to eliminate political debate and become a one-party government. Why did people vote for this racist group? There are many answers, most of them economic, but one reason was that many Germans who were not as extreme as the Nazis did share their prejudice against Jews.</p>
    	<p>That may be why, after the war, democratic governments in Germany were afraid of a possible revival of the Nazi Party. Although in general Germany today has broad freedom of speech, &quot;incitement to hatred&quot; is a criminal offense, and is generally interpreted to include the public display of Nazi symbols, such as the swastika. Hitler's book <em>Mein Kampf</em> could not legally be published in Germany until 2016.</p>

          <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair.png" alt="Talk with Another Pair" title="Talk with Another Pair" />
          <li>Is Germany right to censor Nazi symbols?
            <ul>
              <li>Pro: The Nazis are historically unique in the extent of their mass killings, and traditional German antisemitism (prejudice against Jews) make a Nazi revival a real possibility.</li>
              <li>Con: The law isn't specifically limited to Nazi ideas. The government could declare any idea it disagrees with this an &quot;incitement to hatred&quot; and prosecute people for spreading that idea.</li>
            </ul>
            Discuss this question in groups of four.
          </li>
          <li>Does the United States permit the display of Nazi symbols? Find out online if you're not sure. Why or why not?</li>
        <li>Can it ever be right to censor an idea in one country but not in other countries? Discuss.</li>
        <li>Has the United States ever censored ideas? (You know the First Amendment doesn't allow that, but has it happened anyway?) Research this.</li>
        </ol>
        </div>
         <h3>The Great Firewall of China</h3>
  <p>A 1997 law in the People's Republic of China says this:</p>
  <div class="takeNote">No unit or individual may use the Internet to create, replicate, retrieve, or transmit the following kinds of information:
<ol>
<li>Inciting to resist or breaking the Constitution or laws or the implementation of administrative regulations;</li>
<li>Inciting to overthrow the government or the socialist system;</li>
<li>Inciting division of the country, harming national unification;</li>
<li>Inciting hatred or discrimination among nationalities or harming the unity of the nationalities;</li>
<li>Making falsehoods or distorting the truth, spreading rumors, destroying the order of society;</li>
<li>Promoting feudal superstitions, sexually suggestive material, gambling, violence, murder;</li>
<li>Terrorism or inciting others to criminal activity; openly insulting other people or distorting the truth to slander people;</li>
<li>Injuring the reputation of state organizations;</li>
<li>Other activities against the Constitution, laws or administrative regulations.</li></ol></div>
<p>This law is enforced partly by policing and partly by use of technology, especially at the few border points at which the Chinese Internet connects with other countries. The technical censorship is often called &quot;the Great Firewall of China&quot; outside the country, an ironic reference to the physical Great Wall of China (built over a long period, from 2700 years ago to 400 years ago), built to surround the ancient borders of China and protect it from outside invasion.</p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="5">
<li>What do you think &quot;destroying the order of society&quot; (item 5 above) means?</li>
<li>Item 7 prohibits &quot;insulting other people&quot; on the Internet. Is that a problem in the US? Does it make sense for the government to outlaw insults on the net?</li>
<li>Item 4 essentially prohibits racism on the net. Is that a good idea? Discuss.</li>
<li>Items 1-3 are the most explicitly political, the sort of thing people generally have in mind when they talk about censorship. Is it legal in the US to advocate the overthrow of the government? Research this.</li>
<li>The technology used in China to censor the Internet is largely provided by US companies. Is that legal (in the US)? Should it be?</li>
</ol>
