<p> When you put two "When green flag ..." hat blocks in the same
sprite, both will run at the same time! Similarly, if multiple sprites
all have "When green flag..." hat blocks, these will run concurrently
as well. </p>

<p>Open this <span class="snap">snap</span>  file <code><a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/Snap/SerialVsParallelBuggy.xml">SerialVsParallelBuggy</a></code>,
and click the green flag. Two things will get drawn: </p>

<ul>

  <li> You will see one 'serial' gold square sprite (ten pixels on a
side) paint the area on the right by stamping itself. </li>
  <li> You will also see two blue 'parallel' 10x10 sprites sharing the
labor of painting the area on the left by stamping themselves. </li>
</ul>

<p> (Two screenshots are included below) The first thing to note is
that the parallel side finished in exactly half the time of the serial
side. Discuss with your partner why this is. </p>

<p> The second thing to note is that there is a slight concurrency bug.
The first blue squares for the 1 and 2 sprites appear not to get
stamped. Fix this bug so that there are no missing stamps. </p>

<p>First, a screenshot taken during computation.</p>
