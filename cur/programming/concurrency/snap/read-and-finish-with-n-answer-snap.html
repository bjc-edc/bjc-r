<p>The answer is: all the permutations of 1,2,3 where all three numbers
are present (there are six of them) + all the permutations of 1,2,3
where only two numbers are present (also six of these) + all the
permutations of 1,2,3 where only one number is present (three
possibilities) for a total of fifteen possibilities.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If all three numbers are present, it is as if we were deterministic.
      Here is how it could happen (for this example order, all 6 permutations
      are possible = {123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321}):
      <ul>
        <li>finish starts empty</li>
        <li>1 reads finish (), joins its 1, finish is now 1.</li>
        <li>2 reads finish (1), joins its 2, finish is now 12.</li>
        <li>3 reads finish (12), joins its 3, finish is now 123.</li>
        <li>finish is 123</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If
only two numbers were present, we had a race condition, and here is how
it could happen (again, all 6 combinations and permutations are
possible = {12, 21, 13, 31, 23, 32}): <ul>
        <li>finish starts empty</li>
        <li>3 reads finish () into its hold</li>
        <li>1 reads finish () into its hold</li>
        <li>3 joins its 3 to the number it held (), finish is now 3</li>
        <li>1 joins its 1 to the number it held () and sets finish to 1. The 3 is now lost, <em>clobbered</em> due to a race condition.</li>
        <li>2 reads finish (1), joins its 2, finish is now 12.</li>
        <li>finish is 12</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If
only one number were present, we also had a race condition, and here is
how it could happen (again, all permutations possible = {1, 2, 3}): <ul>
        <li>finish starts empty</li>
        <li>1 reads finish () into its hold</li>
        <li>2 reads finish () into its hold</li>
        <li>3 reads finish () into its hold</li>
        <li>3 joins its 3, finish is now 3</li>
        <li>2 joins its 2 to the number it held () and sets finish to 2. The 3 is now lost, <em>clobbered</em> due to a race condition.</li>
        <li>1 joins its 1 to the number it held () and sets finish to 1. The 2 is now lost, <em>clobbered</em> due to a race condition.</li>
        <li>finish is 1</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
