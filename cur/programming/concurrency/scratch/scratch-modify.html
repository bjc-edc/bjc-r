		<p> In the last Scratch exercise, it was a little artificial;
			the sprites were in lock step. Let's take a look at a similar project,
			<code> <a href="/bjc-r/prog/BYOB/Determinism.ypr">Determinism.ypr</a></code>.
			Here four 60x60 sprites do the same thing (color the screen by stamping themselves through
			the <code>Fill Screen</code> command shown below), and once they finish, they
			add their name to the end of the <code>finish</code> variable. Run it a couple
			of times. Boring, right? That was because Scratch is still in lock step.
		</p>
		<p>
			Make a very small change to Fill Screen - have each sprite wait a random value
			between 1 and 1/10 seconds before stamping. (this involves the introduction of
			a very simple command right before the "stamp" call in <code>Fill Screen</code>:
			"wait (1 / (pick random [1] to [10])) secs"). Run it a few times; now what happens?
			(Answer: Four "threads" take off, and the slowest (i.e., last) color at each
			time step is that one who colors that 60x60 square). Save this project as
			<code>NonDeterminism.ypr</code>.
