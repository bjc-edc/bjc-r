			First, to understand the idea of two things happening at once, load up
			<code><a href="/bjc-r/prog/BYOB/LaunchTutorial.ypr">LaunchTutorial.ypr</a></code>
			(shown above). After you click the green flag, let it run for a bit,
			then hit the space bar once. Then hit it again, and again.
			Talk with your partner about what is happening, and why.

			(Answer: When you hit the green flag, Gobo starts off running in a circle,
			because he's moving and turning at the same time. Now, whenever you hit the space key
			Gobo's circles become wider because he's moving <em>more</em> than before, and he only
			does that because his MOVE <em>threads</em> are increasing, not the number of steps per
			single move. I.e., Scratch initially gives equal time to its 2 &quot;forever&quot; children --
			one that turns and one that moves 5 steps. So it's move, turn, move, turn, etc.,
			yielding a (360/15 =) 24-sided polygon with 5-step sides.
			The next time space bar is pressed, another &quot;child&quot; is born,
			so now the three equal-time children are: &quot;turn&quot;, &quot;move&quot;
			and &quot;move&quot;, yielding a 24-sided polygon with 10-step sides,
			or a &quot;circle&quot; of twice the size)
