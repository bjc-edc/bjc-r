        <p>
            In order to have the modern computer age, in which  people can carry extremely powerful computers in their pockets (their cell phones), circuits had to become much smaller and cheaper. The invention of the <em>integrated circuit </em>("IC" or "chip") made this possible. Integrated circuits combine ("integrate") millions or billions of very tiny electrical parts (transistors, resistors, capacitors, and others) packaged into a small plastic box.

        	The fundamental enabling technology for the computer age was the <em>transistor.</em> In digital circuits, transistors are used as switches. (You'll learn more about them on an upcoming page.) At first, each transistor was in a separate plastic package. Here's a picture of a circuit made with discrete (separate) transistors (the black, D-shaped parts) and resistors (the brown, striped, more-or-less cylindrical parts):<br />

            	<p>In this picture, the transistors are the black, D-shaped parts. The brown, striped, more-or-less cylindrical parts are <em>resistors,</em> a much simpler component that has been around about as long as electricity. The dark lines you can see through the circuit board are wires printed on the board. If your classroom printer had liquid silver ink, it could make circuit boards like this. All the components (transistors and resistors) are on the front of the board. The wires from these components (one at each end of a resistor, three close together on the bottom of a transistor) go through the board, where they are soldered (a kind of hot metallic glue) to the circuit board's wiring. A few wires are on the front side of the board, because otherwise the circuit couldn't be made without the printed wires crossing each other.</p>
                <p>The IBM 7090, developed in 1959, was built out of discrete transistors&mdash;over 50,000 of them. As you can imagine, this machine was large and expensive: about three million dollars, equivalent to over $55 million today. In those days, almost everyone thought that computers would be used only by large corporations or governments.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Early ICs could include only a few transistors. The circuit in the photo above could just about fit in one IC in the early 1960s, but progress was quick. Today's computers require billions of transistors. The largest processor chip in 2017, the AMC Epyc, has more than <em>19 billion</em> transistors!</p>

        <div class="todo">TG: The subject of conflict minerals is can be an upsetting one, involving terrible human rights violations including horrific violence and child labor. As part of understanding the social implications of computing, students are asked to research this topic. Read up these issues before presenting this page to students so you are prepared for students' reactions to this harsh reality. Here are two resources about efforts to address this issue: <a href="https://iq.intel.com/tech-ethics-does-conflict-free-matter" target="_blank">Tech Ethics: Does Conflict Free Matter?

        <p>Several of the metals required by modern technology including gold, tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold are known as <em>conflict minerals</em>. These chemicals are necessary to many devices including phones, computers, tablets, cars, and airplanes. However, the miners who retrieve these materials (primarily in the Democratic Republic of Congo) often live in terrible conditions and are subjected to violence and oppression, and many are small children.</p>
