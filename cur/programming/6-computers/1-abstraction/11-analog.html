            Shouldn't this graph have the axes labeled? Where is this input and output we talk about? I get that we are trying to cut details, but I don't know what I'm looking at. Maybe an animated gif SHOWING fluctuations in the cutoff,  linear, and saturation regions (sequentially) would help. --MF, 11/19/17<br />
            <ul><li>Paul has addressed the image, and I have changed the text, but Paul forgot to commit and sync his changes. ;) He just added "input voltage" and "output voltage" labels on the axes and squished the graph horizontally to make the amplification aspect easier to see. --MF, 11/21/17</li></ul>

        <p>You've learned that a wire can either have a voltage or not have a voltage on it. The reality is more complicated. The on-or-off picture of a wire, a transistor, or a logic gate output is a simplification&mdash;an abstraction. </p>

        <p>This is a rough graph of the actual input-output behavior of a transistor.  Don't worry about the details; just notice the two blue <em>flat</em> parts of the graph. <!--With a very small input (cutoff) or a very large input (saturation), the output is relatively unchanged by small variations.--> Within the "cutoff" region, small changes to the input voltage do not change the output voltage at all; the output is always <em>zero</em> volts. Likewise within the "saturation" region, small input changes hardly impact output voltage; the output is interpreted as a <em>one</em>. This is how transistors are used as <em>switches</em> in a computer.</p>
		<p>Transistors are versatile devices. When used in the middle, linear (pink) part of the graph, they're <em>amplifiers</em>; a small variation in input voltage produces a large variation in output voltage. That's how they're used to play music in a stereo. </p>

            <a href="#hint-chart-labels" data-toggle="collapse">Why are they called "cutoff," "linear," and "saturation"?</a>
            <div id="hint-chart-labels" class="collapse">The lower region of the curve is called "cutoff" because the output is close enough to zero to be treated as off.  The upper region is called "saturation" because the transistor is at its maximum. The central region is called "linear" because it behaves like a linear (straight) function.</div>

		<div class="endnote">The transistor was invented in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Laboratories, also the home of Unix. The inventors were awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.</div>

		<div class="takeNote">The digital domain is not a law of nature; circuit designers have to work at ensuring that each wire in a circuit is always either fully on or fully off.  The digital domain is an abstraction. As with any abstraction, it works only if it's applied consistently.</div>

                <p>The flatness of the output at the two extremes is important because there <em>will</em> be small changes in the input. Electrical circuits have "noise," undesired changes in voltages, for reasons from the transistors getting hot to loose connections on the circuit board to cosmic rays. This is why computers use zeros and ones: a transistor has two flat regions in its input-output curve.</p>
                <p>But the flatness of the flat regions is only approximate, and it depends on how the transistor is connected to the rest of the circuit. One example of a potential problem is <em>fanout,</em> the number of transistor inputs to which one transistor's output is connected.  Beyond a certain number (it depends on the particular transistor type, but certainly ten inputs would be too many), the output voltage is reduced to the point that those inputs might not be sure whether they're getting a zero or a one.</p>
                <p>The way a transistor really works depends on quantum physics. (We're not talking about <em>quantum computers;</em> plain old computer circuits are based on quantum effects also.) To learn more about analog-domain circuit design and what's inside a transistor, take an Electrical Engineering course.</p>
