            Shouldn't this graph have the axes labeled? Where is this input and output we talk about? I get that we are trying to cut details, but I don't know what I'm looking at. Maybe an animated gif SHOWING fluctuations in the cutoff,  linear, and saturation regions (sequentially) would help. --MF, 11/19/17<br />
            After that's addressed, TODO: Improve alt text and add title to image after image is complete. --MF, 11/19/17

        <p>You've learned that a wire can either have a voltage or not have a voltage on it. The reality is more complicated. The on-or-off picture of a wire, a transistor, or a logic gate output is a simplification&mdash;an abstraction. </p>
        <img class="imageLeft" height="220" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/transistor-curve.png" alt="transistor input-output behavior curve">
        <p>This is a rough graph of the actual input-output behavior of a transistor.  You don't have to worry about the details; just take note of the two blue <em>flat</em> parts of the graph. With a very small input (cutoff) or a very large input (saturation), the output is relatively unchanged by small variations. This is how transistors are used as <em>switches,</em> in a computer.</p>
        <div class="todo">Can we add a sentence explaining: What's an amplifier and how does the pink region behave like an amplifier?  --MF, 11/19/17</div>
		<p>Transistors are versatile devices. When used in the pink middle (linear) part of the graph, they're <em>amplifiers,</em> and that's how they're used to play music in a stereo. </p>
        
		<div class="takeNote">The digital domain is not a law of nature; circuit designers have to work at ensuring that each wire in a circuit is always either fully on or fully off.  The digital domain is an abstraction. As with any abstraction, it works only if it's used consistently.
        <div class="todo">This last sentence is not clear to me. I want to change "used" to "applied" or something... --MF, 11/19/17</div>

                <p>The flatness of the output at the two extremes is important because there <em>will</em> be small changes in the input. Electrical circuits have "noise," undesired changes in voltages, for reasons from the transistors getting hot to loose connections on the circuit board to cosmic rays. This is why computers use zeros and ones: A transistor has two flat regions in its input-output curve.</p>
                <div class="comment">I think we could make this second paragraph clearer. --MF, 11/8/17</div>
                <p>But the flatness of the flat regions is only approximate, and it depends on how the transistor is connected to the rest of the circuit. One example of a potential problem is <em>fanout,</em> the number of transistor inputs to which one transistor's output is connected.  Beyond a certain number (it depends on the particular transistor type, but certainly ten inputs would be too many), the output voltage is reduced to the point that those inputs might not be sure whether they're getting a zero or a one.</p>
                <h4>How the Transistor Works</h4>
                <div class="comment">Let's not ever say this (we aren't going to tell you). Why mention it at all? I'd cut. --MF, 11/8/17</div>
                <p>We really can't get into that in this course. The ultimate answer is that it depends on quantum physics. (We're not talking about <em>quantum computers;</em> plain old computer circuits are based on quantum effects also.) To learn more about analog-domain circuit design and what's inside a transistor, take an Electrical Engineering course.</p>
