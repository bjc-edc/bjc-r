        <h2>The Software Domain: Libraries</h2>
        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll learn how some programmers write <em>libraries</em> to help other programmers not have to think about some messy details.</div>
		
		<p>A <strong>library</strong> is a piece of computer code that's meant to be used as part of another program, rather than by itself. Libraries add other features to a language that may be needed by some programmers but not others.</p>
        
        <h3>Snap<em>!</em> Libraries</h3>
        <p>
            You've used libraries in Snap<em>!</em>, consisting of blocks (procedures) that provide some useful abstraction. For example, every time you <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" />, you are importing a library of additional procedures including <code>for</code>, <code>tell</code>, <code>keep</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>label</code>, and <code>combine</code>:<br />

            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/libraries-2.png" alt="Snap! 'Import library' dialog box highlighting 'Tools' library" title="Snap! 'Import library' dialog box highlighting 'Tools' library" />
        </p>
        <p>
        	Snap<em>!</em> also has libraries for many other things, including one for accessing different parts of words and sentences and one for controlling pen color using different ways of encoding colors.<br />

            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/libraries-pen.png" alt="Snap! 'Import library' dialog box highlighting 'Set RGB or HSV pen color' library" title="Snap! 'Import library' dialog box highlighting 'Set RGB or HSV pen color' library" />

        <div class="todo">I would actually be fine to end the page right here (minus the FYTD). --MF, 11/15/17</div>
         
		<h3>Image Libraries</h3>
        <div class="todo">These next two sections still need some work, but we should first address the issue of where image compression really belongs. --MF, 11/15/17</div>
		<p>What happens if an application programmer wants a little picture to be able to move around in a screen that also has other pictures in it? In Snap<em>!</em>, that's built in: import a picture as a <em>costume</em> that can be attached to a sprite, and then  move the picture by moving the sprite. The sprite abstraction lets a programmer <em>move</em> a picture (the sprite's costume) over other pictures (the stage background, pen trails, and other sprites' costumes) without thinking about all the details. Not all languages  include a sprite abstraction. For those languages, other programmers may have developed  libraries to provide that capability.  </p>
        <p>Beyond just representing color, there are also many ways (file formats like BMP, PNG, GIF, and JPG or JPEG) to store the picture information in long-term memory.  These formats differ in compression (more on that below) and in how the computer finds the <em>dimensions</em> of the picture (width and height, in pixels). And the application also has to know how to put the picture up on the actual screen. So application programmers use <em>graphics libraries</em> to take care of these details.</p> 
                
        <h3>Other Types of Libraries</h3>
        <p>And other common tasks—for example, knowing where the mouse pointer is, doing arithmetic on huge numbers, managing sound—have complex parts, too. If application programmers had to deal with all of these details in every program, no software would ever get developed. And because many languages and apps need the same abilities, it's wasteful to rewrite all that code for each one. That's why programmers write <em>libraries</em> for other programmers to  use.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Read through the libraries listed in Snap<em>!</em> (as shown above), and choose one block that interests you and that you have never used. Build a small project that uses that block, and use your project to teach that block to some of your classmates.</li>
