        <h2>The Digital Domain: Components</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>BH: I would scrap the part about external components, and focus on what's important and on the AP exam: processor, memory, I/O.</p>
		</div>

        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll explore the <em>parts</em> (components) of the computer hardware.</div>

        <p>For as long as people have been teaching other people about computers,  they always say  "A computer consists of the processor, memory, and input/output (I/O) devices." </p>
        <p>
            In the early days of computers, it was easy to point out the huge racks of equipment that contained each of those three components:<br />
            <img class="indent" width="400px" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/pdp-10.jpg" alt="Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 Processor and Memory" title="Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 Processor and Memory">
            <img class="inline" width="360px" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/pdp-10-disks.jpg" alt="Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 Magnetic tape drives, disk drives, and other I/O devices" title="Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 Magnetic tape drives, disk drives, and other I/O devices">
        </p>
        <p>These are pictures of a powerful computer from the 1970s. Each of the big racks full of circuitry is about the size of a refrigerator.  Today, a much more powerful computer—more speed, more memory—fits inside a cell phone.</p>
        <p>Because today's processors and memory are so small, most of what we see is the <strong>input/output (I/O)</strong> devices, like keyboard, mouse, screens. <em>Input</em> devices include the keyboard, mouse, and microphone. <em>Output</em> devices include the printer, speaker, and (for laptop or desktop computers) the display screen. On phones and tablets, touchscreens are used for both input and output. Disk drives, optical drives (for CDs and DVDs), and the Internet interface are also used for both.</p>
