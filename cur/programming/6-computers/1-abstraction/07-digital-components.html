        <h2>The Digital Domain: Components</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>EK 2.2.3I Hardware is built using multiple levels of abstractions, such as transistors, logic gates, chips, memory, motherboards, special purposes cards, and storage devices.</p>
            <p>EK 5.2.1F Processes use memory, a central processing unit (CPU), and input and output.</p>

        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll explore the <em>parts</em> (components) of the computer hardware.</div>
        
        <p>For as long as people have been teaching other people about computers,  they always say  "A computer consists of the processor, memory, and input/output (I/O) devices." </p>
        <p>
            In the early days of computers, it was easy to point out the huge racks of equipment that contained each of those three components:<br />
            <img class="indent" width="400px" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/pdp-10.jpg" alt="Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 Processor and Memory" title="Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 Processor and Memory">

        </p>
        <p>These are pictures of a powerful computer from the 1970s. Each of the big racks full of circuitry is about the size of a refrigerator.  Today, a much more powerful computer—more speed, more memory—fits inside a cell phone.</p>
        <p>Because today's processors and memory are so small, most of what we see is the <strong>input/output (I/O)</strong> devices, like keyboard, mouse, screens. <em>Input</em> devices include the keyboard, mouse, and microphone. <em>Output</em> devices include the printer, speaker, and (for laptop or desktop computers) the display screen. On phones and tablets, touchscreens are used for both input and output. Disk drives, optical drives (for CDs and DVDs), and the Internet interface are also used for both.</p>

                EK 3.3.1A Digital data representations involve trade offs related to storage, security, and privacy concerns. <br />
                EK 3.3.1F Security and privacy concerns arise with data containing personal information.<br />
                EK 3.3.1G Data is stored in many formats depending on its characteristics (e.g., size and intended use)
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Data is stored in different formats depending its size and intended use. For example, external hard drives can be helpful for storing extra data that isn't accessed as frequently because they may not always be connected to the computer, and they may have a slower connection to the computer than the internal hard drive does (though it depends on the user's setup and the hard drive connection cables).</p>
        <p>Security is also a concern in data storage systems. If you lose your computer, you may have a password on it that will offer <em>a little</em> security for your data, but you might not think to put a password on a CD. Data can be <em>encrypted</em> as it is stored, but that can make the data take longer to access, and if you forget the decryption password, you can be locked out of your data.</p>
