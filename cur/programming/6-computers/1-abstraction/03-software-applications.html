        <h2>The Software Domain: Applications</h2>
        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong> you'll explore some of the many purposes for which people use computers.</div>
        
        <p>
            Application programs (or "apps" for short) are the programs that users interact with. Here are some uses of such software that you may be familiar with: 
			<ul>
                <li><strong>Communication.</strong> You use a browser to view webpages on the World Wide Web. You keep in touch with friends using social networking, email, text messages, and chat applications that can be text-based, audio-based, or video-based. You can also tell the world what you think in a blog (short for weblog) or a vlog (short for video blog).</li>
                <div class="vocabBig"><strong>: the cloud</strong>
                    <p>You can store your data (photos, music, videos, text, etc.) either <em>locally</em> (on your computer) or in <strong><em>the cloud</em></strong>. "In the cloud" just means "on the Internet."</p>
                    <p>You have been using the cloud throughout this whole course! All of your Snap! projects are stored in the cloud. That's why you have to log in to access your projects.</p>
                    <div class="endnote">Similarly, if you use Google Drive or Dropbox, all of those files are stored in the cloud. And if you use a web-based email service (like Gmail or Yahoo), your emails are stored in the cloud.</div>
                </div>
                <li><strong>Audio.</strong> Your computer or phone almost certainly has an application to play music&mdash;either from your own collection or from an Internet radio server in the <em>cloud</em>. You can also use software to <em>create</em> music by using synthesizers that create new sounds, sampling (reusing) existing sounds, and recording sounds around you. </li>        
                <li><strong>Pictures.</strong> You likely have a photo viewing application on your own computer or phone. You can also use software to manipulate pictures to create artwork, sharpen the focus, or create "fake news" by combining unrelated images.</li> 
				<div class="todo">
                	It would be great to have a funny picture here&mdash;maybe Obama shaking hands with an alien or something obviously fake like this (but not as creepy)... --MF, 11/13/17<br />

				</div>
                <li><strong>Video.</strong> You can use streaming video services to watch movies online, or you can create your own. You can shoot movies on your phone, edit them by combining video from different sources, <!--You can animate cartoons with software just for that purpose.--> and upload them to the Internet or burn them onto a DVD to share them with your friends.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Your</em> programs.</strong>The projects you've been creating in Snap<em>!</em> are apps too!
                <li>
                <div class="todo">I struggle with having this last one on the list. Make I need the connection to "apps" to be stronger and more clear. --MF, 11/13/17</div>
                <strong>Data Mining</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning.</strong> The amount of information available on the Internet is huge. Computers can learn to combine information from different sources, to produce surprising results. <div class="endnote">For example, scientists teach computers to explore telescope observations to learn new things about how the physical universe works.  Businesses can combine location information from your phone with similar information from other phones to find traffic jams or popular restaurants. Or they can combine multiple sources of online information about you to send you targeted advertising for products you're likely to want, or to keep track of your political views for policing or voter registration drives.</div></li>
            </ul>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<div class="todo"> from Brian: I'd suggest possibilities that are similar to what we do in social implications labs here. I don't claim these are best examples, but they may suggest ideas.
                <ol>
                    <li>Read and discuss the chapter "Propaganda Machine" (pages 68–83) in <em>Weapons of Math Destruction: How big data increases inequality and threatens democracy</em> by mathematician Cathy O'Neil. It gives examples of   destructive sides of "targeted advertising," and mentions a school in Brooklyn that helped expose one such destructive example.</li>
                    <li>What popular composers use "sampling" for their songs?</li>
                    <li>What is "autotune" and what popular artists use it? </li>
                    <li>What kinds of photo processing can you do with software? What kinds have you done?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>from Mary: I think #1 could be an ITIT <em>if</em> it's available for free online. I think #2 is likely to be engaging, but I wouldn't want it to become a time-waster. Maybe we could give them a link like <a href="https://www.whosampled.com/top-sampling-artists/" target="_blank">https://www.whosampled.com/top-sampling-artists/</a>. I don't find #3 that interesting, and we already have a music suggestion. I guess for both #2 and #3 I'd like to see more focus on software. Maybe we could find a nice "how to sample music" demo video? BTW, have you seen <a href="https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/" target="_blank">earsketch</a>? Re #4, I like having some photo stuff, but I'm not sure this is the right question. I want something more useful—a video perhaps or ideally some hands-on experience, though that, of course, requires software... What about using the Scratch vector editor? I can imagine why we might balk at that, but it's relevant, accessible, free, and stable... If not, something like that then? Just thoughts... --MF, 11/8/17</p>
            </div>
            <div class="comment">I'm not 100% excited about having this question on this page, but I felt the need to define "the cloud" above, and this goes with that. Thoughts? --MF, 11/13/17</div>

                	This question is similar to the type of questions you will see on the AP CSP exam.
