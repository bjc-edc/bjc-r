        <p>2.2.3F A logic gate is a hardware abstraction that is modeled by a Boolean function. <br />
        2.2.3I Hardware is built using multiple levels of abstractions, such as transistors, logic gates, chips, memory, motherboards, special purposes cards, and storage devices.</p>
        </div>
        
		<div class="learn"><strong>On this page,</strong> you  review three Boolean operators (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>) and learn how they relate to electronic circuitry.</div>
        
		<p>In a circuit with billions of transistors, or even thousands of transistors, hardware designers can't think about each individual transistor. Just as programmers use abstraction, hardware architects use abstractions, in which a group of transistors and other circuit elements are considered as a single thing. What kinds of things? There are basically two kinds, one for memory and one for computation.</p>

                <p>Memory is made out of <em>flip-flops.</em> A flip-flop is a circuit that has two stable states, on and off. An input signal can tell it to turn on, turn off, or change whatever it's state is.  Once that happens, the flip-flop stays in the new state until it gets another signal. It has an output that reflects its state: on if the flip-flop is on, off if it's off.</p>

        <h3>Boolean Operators</h3>
        <p>The circuits to do computation are more interesting. They compute <em>functions,</em> just like reporters in Snap<em>!</em>. Since computers do a lot of arithmetic, you might think that the basic circuit functions would be addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but that's not the case. Of course there <em>are</em> circuits to do those things, but they're made out of <em>logic gates:</em> circuits that compute <strong>Boolean functions</strong>: <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>.</p>
        <p>The reason that Boolean functions are considered more fundamental is that their inputs and outputs can be represented with a single wire going into or out from the circuit.  That's not true about arithmetic functions.  If you consider a voltage on a wire as meaning 1, and no voltage as meaning 0, then you have to see that an adder will have <em>three</em> possible output values, because 1+1=2, which is neither 0 nor 1.  By contrast, if you consider a voltage on a wire as meaning True, and no voltage as meaning False, then the output from a Boolean function of two inputs can still only be True or False, so only one output wire is needed.</p>

        <h2>Logic Gates</h2>
        <p>Inside a computer, Boolean operations are implemented in physical circuitry using logic gates. (A single gate implements one of the basic functions <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, or <code>not</code>.) Logic circuits are often represented with drawings that help engineers see how the information will flow through a circuit. For example, the following diagram of a logic circuit with two gates represents the Boolean expression <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/(a)or((a)and(b))-booleans.png" alt="A or (A and B)" title="A or (A and B)" />. Can you see how?</p>

		<div class="takeNote">On the previous page, you learned about tungsten and tin, and here we're talking about Boolean functions. In what sense is this less abstract? <strong>From the point of view of the chip designer, logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of a digital circuit.</strong> (The actual physical chip fabrication is at an even lower level of abstraction, in the analog domain.)</div>
