        <h2>The Software Domain: Programming Languages</h2>
        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong>, you will consider why there are different programming languages and look at some of the ways that languages differ.</div>
        
        
        <p>JavaScript, Python, Snap<em>!</em>, C++, Java, Scheme, Prolog... Why are there so many programming languages? Why don't we just pick the best one, or design a new best one, and stick with that?</p>
        <p>Some languages have very narrow purposes; these are called <em>special-purpose</em> languages. For example, Microsoft Word has a programming language built into it called "Word macros" that's just for generating data and formatting in a document. Likewise, HTML (Hyper-text Mark-up Language) is just for designing web pages.</p>
        <p><em>General-purpose</em> languages are more powerful. In a sense, these languages are all the same: if an algorithm can be expressed in one language, it can be expressed in all of them. The differences among languages are mostly about <em>levels of abstraction.</em></p>
        
        
		<h3>High-Level and Low-Level Languages</h3>
        <p>A programming language provides basic parts with built-in behaviors that you, the programmer, assemble in order to accomplish your purpose. For example in Snap<em>!</em>, there are built-in parts like  <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if.png"  alt="the if-block" title="the if-block" />, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat-empty.png" alt="the repeat block" title="the repeat block" />, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/equals.png" alt="the equals block" title="the equals block" />, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/and.png" alt="the and block" title="the and block" />, and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-left.png" height="38" alt="the turn counterclockwise block" title="the turn counterclockwise block" />. Often, you assemble those basic parts into bigger parts that <em>your</em> program will need, like <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/greet-player.png" height="36" alt="greet player block"  title="greet player block" /> or <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-selector.png" alt="name from contact: ()" title="name from contact: ()" />, and then you think in terms of these higher levels of abstraction. </p>
        <p>A <em>high-level language</em> (like JavaScript, Python, or Snap<em>!</em>) includes many built-in abstractions that make it easier to focus on the problem you want to solve rather than on how computer hardware works. A <em>low-level language</em> (like Assembly) has few abstractions, requiring you to know a lot about your computer's architecture to write a program.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>Why do programmers use high-level languages?</strong></h4>
        <p>High-level languages can produce <em>safer</em> programs&mdash;ones that are less likely to have bugs&mdash;because the abstractions manage messy details that can trip up programmers. </p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <a href="#hint-memory" data-toggle="collapse">Read about how high-level languages reduce bugs in memory use.</a>
            <div id="hint-memory" class="collapse">
            <p>Older, low-level languages required the programmer to manage the use of the computer's memory with instructions saying "get me a block of memory big enough to hold 100 numbers" and other instructions saying "okay, I'm finished using this block of memory; it can be allocated for some other purpose."</p>
            <p>This is a nuisance to have to think about, and human programmers are bad at it. In low level languages, a very common bug is for one part of a program to say "I'm done with this block of memory" while another part of the program is still using it. High-level languages take care of this for us by using a technique called <em>garbage collection</em> that puts the computer in charge of knowing when a block of memory is no longer in use.</div>
        </div>
        <p>High-level languages can also make programming much more convenient. One example is <em>higher order functions</em>...</p>

        <p>A high-level language, like Snap<em>!</em>, includes functions like these higher-order functions to allow the programmer to write shorter, cleaner code. 

        <h4><strong>Why do programmers use low-level languages?</strong></h4>
		<p>The most common use of low-level languages is to write operating systems (like Windows, Mac OSX, Android, or iOS). You'll learn more about Operating systems on the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/1-abstraction/06-software-OS.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F6-how-computers-work.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">The Software Domain: Operating Systems</a> page.</p>

                <p><em>Programmers may think that abstraction is too slow.</em> Programmers of 3-D video games  need all the speed they can get; their programs strain the speed of modern computers. So they often write part of their programs, the part that actually puts pictures on the screen, in machine language, just for speed. But most programmers  write applications that don't strain computers at all. When you send an email or text message, the limiting factor  is how fast you can type, not how fast your computer can run programs.</p>
                <p><em>Legacy code.</em> Programmers in industry hardly ever get to write a program from the beginning. Much more often, they're maintaining a program that somebody wrote years ago, and that person might not even work for that company anymore. In the long run, it might be better to rewrite the program in a more modern language, but in the short run, there's no time to do that so they end up modifying the existing code in the existing programming language.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h4><strong>What is machine language?</strong></h4>
        <p>Both high- and low-level languages are used by <em>people</em> to write computer programs. Computer hardware understands a sort of ultra-low-level language, called <em>machine language.</em> Special programs called <em>compilers</em> and <em>interpreters</em> are used to translate human programming languages into machine language.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <a href="#hint-compilers" data-toggle="collapse">Click to learn more about compilers and interpreters.</a>
            <div id="hint-compilers" class="collapse">
                <p>A <em>compiler</em> is a program that takes a high- or low-level language program (the <em>source code</em>) as input and produces a machine language program (the <em>object code</em>) as its output. Once produced, the machine language program can be run repeatedly without needing to be compiled again.</p>
                <p>An <em>interpreter</em> is a program that takes a high- or low-level program as input and carries out machine language instructions as needed to run the program. It does not produce a stand-alone machine language program as output and will have to repeat the process again next time.</p>
                <p>
                    <a href="#hint-compilers-better" data-toggle="collapse">Does that mean compilers are better?</a>
                    <div id="hint-compilers-better" class="collapse">
                        <div class="comment">We haven't taught the visual stepping feature in Snap<em>!</em>, so it seems weird to reference it here. --MF, 11/13/17</div>
                        <p>It <em>would</em> mean that, except that the process of writing a program includes <em>debugging.</em> During the debugging, an interpreter can help by providing information about the progress of the program, like the visual stepping feature in Snap<em>!</em>, and allowing small changes in the source program without having to run a compiler repeatedly. For example, in Snap<em>!</em> you can drag a block into a script while it's running, and a compiler couldn't allow that.</p>
                        <p>For professional programmers, the best arrangement is to have <em>both</em> an interpreter and a compiler for the same language. The programmer writes and debugs the program using an interpreter, and once they're sure it works, they compile it. Then, the compiler can run slowly, putting a lot of effort into <em>optimizing</em> the machine language code, so they get the fastest possible compiled program. <!--(Doesn't slowing down the compiler undo the benefit of speeding up the object code? No, because the program is compiled only once, but it may be run thousands or millions of times, especially if it's an application that millions of people use.)--></p>
