                1.3.1B Digital audio and music can be created by synthesizing sounds, sampling existing audio and music, and recording and manipulating sounds, including layering and looping.<br />
                1.3.1C Digital images can be created by generating pixel patterns, manipulating existing digital images, or combining images.<br />
                1.3.1D Digital effects and animations can be created by using existing software or modified software that includes functionality to implement the effects and animations.<br />

                  <li>OK fine, moved to 1.1.2 --bh            </li>

                7.2.1A Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science.<br />
          <ul><li>From ST: "We define the terms but not clear to me where this is covered" --MF, 11/28/17</li>
            <li>The paragraph about data mining talks about business applications, and the paragraph about machine learning talks about scientific applications. I've copied this EK to 3.5.2, where they work with a medical application. --bh</li>
          </ul>
                7.2.1B Scientific computing has enabled innovation in science and business.<br />
                <ul><li>From ST: "Not clear to me where this is covered" --MF, 11/28/17</li>
                  <li>Oy, I'm not sure what's really different between this and 7.2.1A. Maybe we could have more to say about scientific computing. 3.5.1 talks about seti@home and folding@home, let's put it there.</li>
                </ul>
                7.2.1C Computing enables innovation by providing access to and sharing of information.<br />
                <ul><li>From ST: "Not clear to me where this is covered" --MF, 11/28/17</li>
                  <li>OK, this is also seti@home etc. 3.5.1. And 3.5.2 also, come to think of it. But the data mining stuff here is also relevant.  --bh</li>

        <h2>The Software Domain: Applications</h2>
        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll explore some of the many purposes for which people use software applications.</div>
        
        <p>
            Application programs (or "apps" for short) are the programs that users interact with. Here are some uses of such software that you may be familiar with: 
           <ul>
                <li><strong>Communication.</strong> You use a browser to view web pages on the World Wide Web. You keep in touch with friends using social networking, email, text messages, and chat applications that can be text-based, audio-based, or video-based. You can also tell the world what you think in a blog (short for weblog) or a vlog (short for video blog).</li>
				<li><strong>Audio.</strong> Your computer or phone almost certainly has an application to play music&mdash;either from your own collection or from an Internet radio server. You can also use software to <em>create</em> music by using synthesizers that make new sounds, sampling (reusing) existing sounds, and recording sounds around you. </li>        
                <li><strong>Pictures.</strong> You likely have a photo viewing application on your own computer or phone. You can also use software to manipulate pictures to create artwork, sharpen the focus, or create "fake news" by combining unrelated images.</li> 
				<div class="todo">
                	It would be great to have a funny picture here&mdash;maybe Obama shaking hands with an alien or something obviously fake like this (but not as creepy)... --MF, 11/13/17<br />

				</div>
                <li><strong>Video.</strong> You can use streaming video services to watch movies online, or you can create your own. You can shoot movies on your phone, edit them by combining video from different sources, <!--You can animate cartoons with software just for that purpose.--> and upload them to the Internet or burn them onto a DVD to share them with your friends.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Your</em> programs.</strong> The projects you've been creating in Snap<em>!</em> are apps too!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            There are other kinds of software that aren't for personal use but are used in industry and universities. Software applications are written to guide rockets, to analyze the results of experiments, and to design buildings and cars. Software is even written to write software. 
            <ul>
    			<li>The amount of information available on the Internet is huge. Computers can learn to combine information from different sources, to produce surprising results. This is called <strong>data mining</strong>. For example, businesses can combine location information from your phone with similar information from other phones to find traffic jams or popular restaurants. Or they can combine multiple sources of online information about you to send you targeted advertising for products you're likely to want or to keep track of your political views for voter registration drives.</li>
                <li>Computers can be taught to <em>generalize</em> from the information they finds to patterns to predict the future. This is called <strong>machine learning</strong>. For example, scientists teach computers to explore telescope observations to learn new things about how the physical universe works.</li>
