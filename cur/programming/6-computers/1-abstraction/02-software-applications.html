        <h2>The Software Domain: Applications</h2>
        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll explore some of the many purposes for which people use computers.</div>
        
        <p>
            Application programs (or "apps" for short) are the programs that users interact with. Here are some uses of such software that you may be familiar with: 
           <ul>
                <li><strong>Communication.</strong> You use a browser to view web pages on the World Wide Web. You keep in touch with friends using social networking, email, text messages, and chat applications that can be text-based, audio-based, or video-based. You can also tell the world what you think in a blog (short for weblog) or a vlog (short for video blog).</li>

                    This belongs in U4. Move next year. Some content commented out here. Also there is a related quiz commented out at the end of the page. --MF, 11/15/17
                    <div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: the cloud</strong>
                        <p>You can store your data (photos, music, videos, text, etc.) either <em>locally</em> (on your computer) or in <em><strong>the cloud</strong></em>. Storing data in the cloud means storing <em>somewhere</em> on the Internet, but you don't have to worry about where&mdash;the cloud service provider (Google Drive, Dropbox, Snap!, etc) manages the actual storage location.</p>
                        <!--<p>Some applications run in the cloud and never get downloaded to or installed on your computer at all (like Snap<em>!</em>).</p>
                        <p>You have been using the cloud throughout this whole course! All of your Snap<em>!</em> projects are stored in the cloud. That's why you have to log in to access your projects.</p>
                        <div class="endnote">Similarly, if you use Google Drive or Dropbox, all of those files are stored in the cloud. And if you use a web-based email service (like Gmail or Yahoo), your emails are stored in the cloud.</div>-->
                    </div>
                </div>
                <li><strong>Audio.</strong> Your computer or phone almost certainly has an application to play music&mdash;either from your own collection or from an Internet radio server. You can also use software to <em>create</em> music by using synthesizers that make new sounds, sampling (reusing) existing sounds, and recording sounds around you. </li>        
                <li><strong>Pictures.</strong> You likely have a photo viewing application on your own computer or phone. You can also use software to manipulate pictures to create artwork, sharpen the focus, or create "fake news" by combining unrelated images.</li> 
				<div class="todo">
                	It would be great to have a funny picture here&mdash;maybe Obama shaking hands with an alien or something obviously fake like this (but not as creepy)... --MF, 11/13/17<br />

				</div>
                <li><strong>Video.</strong> You can use streaming video services to watch movies online, or you can create your own. You can shoot movies on your phone, edit them by combining video from different sources, <!--You can animate cartoons with software just for that purpose.--> and upload them to the Internet or burn them onto a DVD to share them with your friends.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Your</em> programs.</strong> The projects you've been creating in Snap<em>!</em> are apps too!</li>

            There are other kinds of software that aren't for personal use but are used in industry and universities. Software applications are written to guide rockets, to analyze the results of experiments, and to design buildings and cars. Software is even written to write software. 
            <ul>
    			<li>The amount of information available on the Internet is huge. Computers can learn to combine information from different sources, to produce surprising results. This is called <strong>data mining</strong>. For example, businesses can combine location information from your phone with similar information from other phones to find traffic jams or popular restaurants. Or they can combine multiple sources of online information about you to send you targeted advertising for products you're likely to want or to keep track of your political views for voter registration drives.</li>
                <li>Computers can be taught to <em>generalize</em> from the information they finds to patterns to predict the future. This is called <strong>machine learning</strong>. For example, scientists teach computers to explore telescope observations to learn new things about how the physical universe works.</li>
