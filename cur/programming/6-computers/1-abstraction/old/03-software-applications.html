        <h2>The Software Domain</h2>
        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong> you'll explore some of the many purposes for which people use computers.</div>
        <div class="todo">I think this top section (before the H3) belongs on the previous page (in abbreviated form) --MF, 11/8/17</div>
        <p>Mostly, when we talk about software, we mean application programs ("apps" for short) and the operating system (often OS for short).  Roughly, apps are the programs that <em>we</em> interact with (text editors, photo editors, calculators, music players, browsers, Snap<em>!</em>, etc.)  and operating systems are the programs that the apps interact with (like Mac OS or Microsoft Windows) to communicate with the computer. </p>

		<div class="comment">I find the list of Snap<em>!</em> blocks misleading. It reads like these are the only ones relevant here (too easy to miss the word "like" and be distracted by the colorful blocks. Just needs rephrasing. --MF, 11/8/17</div>
        <p>Programs start out as ideas in your head; a <em>programming language</em> lets you express those ideas in a form that can be carried out by a computer. The programming language—<em>any</em> programming language—provides   basic parts with built-in behaviors that you, the programmer, just assemble in order to accomplish your purpose. In Snap<em>!</em>, these  are parts like  <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if.png"  alt="the if-block" title="the if-block">, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat-empty.png" alt="the repeat block" title="the repeat block">, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/equals.png" alt="the equals block" title="the equals block">, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/and.png" alt="the and block" title="the and block">, and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-left.png" height="38" alt="the turn counterclockwise block" title="the turn counterclockwise block">. Often, you assemble those very basic parts into bigger parts that <em>your</em> program will need, like <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/greet-player.png" height="36" alt="greet player block"  title="greet player block" />, and then you think in terms of these even higher levels of abstraction. </p>
       <p>A  programming language may also make use of specialized libraries that add other features needed by some programmers  but not others. Here and on the next three pages, you will learn more  about the software domain: applications, programming languages, libraries, and  operating systems.</p>

        
        <h3>The Software Domain: Applications</h3>
        <div class="todo">I'll have edits here when I come back around, but I'm aiming for a quick read now. --MF, 11/8/17</div>
		<p>The word "computer" is a reminder that the first application programs were all about numbers. Scientists used computers to solve equations; businesses used computers to work out budgets and payroll.</p>
        <p>
            Today's computer applications have much more variety. Here are some of the things software can do:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Communication.</strong> For many people, the <strong>browser</strong> <em>is</em> the computer.  (That's particularly true if your computer is a <em>Chromebook,</em> in which all of the traditional computer applications are on a server somewhere, and the browser is used to do everything.)  You keep in touch with friends using <strong>social networking</strong>, <strong>email</strong>, <strong>text messages</strong>, and <strong>chat</strong> applications that can be text-based, audio-based, or video-based. You can also tell the world what you think in a <strong>blog</strong>. Communication can be just for fun, or it can be to <strong>share information</strong> to help the world.</li>
                <li><strong>Sound.</strong> Your computer or phone almost certainly has an application to <strong>play music</strong>, from your own collection or from an Internet radio server. But computers are also used to <strong>create music</strong>, including <strong>synthesizers</strong> that create new sounds, <strong>sampling</strong> of existing sounds, and <strong>recording</strong> the sounds around you.  You can also ask your phone to <strong>identify</strong> a song that you hear.</li>        
                <li><strong>Pictures.</strong> You can keep a <strong>library</strong> of pictures on your own computer or at a photo upload server. Your phone or laptop has a <strong>camera</strong>, or maybe two, one in back for traditional picture-taking and one in front for <strong>selfies</strong>.  You can <strong>manipulate</strong> pictures to create <strong>artwork</strong>, sharpen the focus, or create "fake news" by combining unrelated images.</li>        
                <li><strong>Video.</strong> You can <strong>shoot movies</strong> on your phone. You can use <strong>streaming video</strong> services to watch almost any movie ever made, or you can <strong>upload</strong> your own movies and hope to become an Internet star.  You can <strong>edit</strong> movies by combining video from different sources.  You can <strong>animate cartoons</strong> with software just for that purpose.  And you can <strong>burn</strong> your movie onto a DVD as a present for a friend.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Mining</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning.</strong> The amount of information available on the Internet is huge. Computers can learn to combine information from different sources, to produce surprising results. <strong>Scientists</strong> teach computers to explore <strong>telescope observations</strong> to learn new things about how the physical universe works.  <strong>Businesses</strong> can combine location information from your phone with similar information from other phones to find <strong>traffic jams</strong> or <strong>popular restaurants</strong>. Or they can combine multiple sources of online information <strong>about you</strong> to send you <strong>targeted advertising</strong> for products you're likely to want, or to keep track of your <strong>political views</strong> for policing or voter registration drives.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <div class="todo"> I'd suggest possibilities that are similar to what we do in social implications labs here. I don't claim these are best examples, but they may suggest ideas.
                <ol>
                    <li>Read and discuss the chapter "Propaganda Machine" (pages 68–83) in <em>Weapons of Math Destruction: How big data increases inequality and threatens democracy</em> by mathematician Cathy O'Neil. It gives examples of   destructive sides of "targeted advertising," and mentions a school in Brooklyn that helped expose one such destructive example.</li>
                    <li>What popular composers use "sampling" for their songs?</li>
                    <li>What is "autotune" and what popular artists use it? </li>
                    <li>What kinds of photo processing can you do with software? What kinds have you done?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I think #1 could be an ITIT <em>if</em> it's available for free online. I think #2 is likely to be engaging, but I wouldn't want it to become a time-waster. Maybe we could give them a link like <a href="https://www.whosampled.com/top-sampling-artists/" target="_blank">https://www.whosampled.com/top-sampling-artists/</a>. I don't find #3 that interesting, and we already have a music suggestion. I guess for both #2 and #3 I'd like to see more focus on software. Maybe we could find a nice "how to sample music" demo video? BTW, have you seen <a href="https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/" target="_blank">earsketch</a>? Re #4, I like having some photo stuff, but I'm not sure this is the right question. I want something more useful—a video perhaps or ideally some hands-on experience, though that, of course, requires software... What about using the Scratch vector editor? I can imagine why we might balk at that, but it's relevant, accessible, free, and stable... If not, something like that then? Just thoughts... --MF, 11/8/17</p>
