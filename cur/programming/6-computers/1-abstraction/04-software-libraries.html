        <h2>The Software Domain: Libraries</h2>
        <div class="todo">

        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll that a library is a package of procedures written by other programmers that helps solve a problem.</div>

        <p>Suppose a programmer wants a picture to move around on a screen that also has other pictures on it. In Snap<em>!</em>, that's built in: import a picture as a sprite <em>costume</em>, and then move it by moving the sprite. The sprite abstraction lets a programmer move a picture over other pictures without thinking about what happens where the images overlap or how to get back parts of the image after they are covered up. Not all languages have the sprite abstraction.</p>
        <p>Other common tasks (such as knowing where the mouse pointer is, doing arithmetic on huge numbers, or managing sound) also have complex parts. If programmers had to deal with all of these details in every program, no software would ever get developed. And because many applications need the same abilities, programmers write <em>libraries</em> for other programmers to use.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>software library</strong> is a package of procedures that you can import into your program. A library is a kind of abstraction: you don't have to know any of the details of how it's coded. You can build libraries yourself, or you can use one that someone else wrote.</li>
                <div class="comment">AAP-3.D.4, AAP-3.D.5</div>
                <li>An <strong>application program interface (API)</strong> documents what the user of a library needs to know about it: it's a description of each procedure's purpose, inputs, and outputs (but not its algorithms).</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="endnote">
            <h4><strong>Web API</strong></h4>
            <p>A common kind of API is a <em>web API</em> in which the library exists on someone else's computer. For example, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/start" title="Google Maps API" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a> describes how to embed a Google Map on your own website.</p>
            <p>A web API is just a call to a procedure on another machine. For example, these are three different notations for the same procedure call:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=BJC&geo=US" title="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=BJC&amp;geo=US" target="_blank">https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=BJC&amp;geo=US</a></li>
                    <li><pre class="inline">EXPLORE (q = BJC, geo = US) </pre></li>
                    <li><img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/explore-api-example.png" alt="explore, query: (BJC) geographical location: (US)" title="explore, query: (BJC) geographical location: (US)" /></li>
                </ul>
            The only difference is that the URL shows where on the Internet to find the procedure.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Languages vs. Libraries</h3>
        <p>Often when people compare what different programming languages can do, they are <em>really</em> comparing libraries. For example, people may think they like JavaScript because they can use it to program web pages, but that's not a property of JavaScript. It's actually a web page <em>library</em> built into the browser that lets you program web pages.</p>

        <h3>Libraries in Snap<em>!</em></h3>
        <p>
            You've used libraries in Snap<em>!</em>. For example, when you imported the "Frequency Distribution Analysis" library in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-making-computers-do-math/1-math-predicates.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 2 Lab 4 Page 1: Mathematical Predicates">Unit 2 Lab 4 Page 1: Mathematical Predicates</a> or the "Set RGB or HSV pen color" Library in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/5-representation-compression/8-compression.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 4 Lab 5 Page 8: Data Compression">Unit 4 Lab 5 Page 8: Data Compression</a>, you were importing a library of additional procedures including <code>set pen color</code> and <code>pipe</code>. Snap<em>!</em> also has libraries for many other things, such as one for accessing different parts of words and sentences.<br />
