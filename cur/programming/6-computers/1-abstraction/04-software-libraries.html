        <h2>The Software Domain: Libraries</h2>
        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll learn how some programmers write <em>libraries</em> to help other programmers not have to think about some messy details.</div>

		<p>Suppose an application programmer wants a little picture to be able to move around in a screen that also has other pictures in it. In Snap<em>!</em>, that's built in: import a picture as a <em>costume</em> that can be attached to a sprite, and then move the picture by moving the sprite. The sprite abstraction lets a programmer <em>move</em> a picture (the sprite's costume) over other pictures (the stage background, pen trails, and other sprites' costumes) without thinking about all the details. Not all languages have the sprite abstraction.</p>
        <p>Other common  tasks&mdash;for example, knowing where the mouse pointer is, doing arithmetic on huge numbers, or managing sound&mdash;also have complex parts. If application programmers had to deal with all of these details in every program, no software would ever get developed. And because many languages and apps need the same abilities, it's wasteful to rewrite all that code for each one. So programmers write <em>libraries</em> for other programmers to use.</p>

        	<p>A <strong>library</strong> is a piece of computer code that's meant to be used as part of another program, rather than by itself. <!--Libraries add other features to a language that may be needed by some programmers but not others.--></p>
            <p>An <strong>application program interface</strong> (API) is the documentation of what the <em>user</em> of a library needs to know about it: its inputs and outputs, but not the algorithm.</p>

            You've used libraries in Snap<em>!</em>, consisting of blocks (procedures) that provide some useful abstraction. For example, every time you <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" />, you are importing a library of additional procedures including <code>for</code>, <code>keep</code>, <code>label</code>, <code>combine</code>, and <code>for each</code>. Snap<em>!</em> also has libraries for many other things, including one for accessing different parts of words and sentences and one for controlling pen color using different ways of encoding colors.<br />
