<h2>Logic Gates: NAND, NOR, XOR </h2>
<div class="learn"><strong>On this page,</strong> you will explore some more complex logic gates: NAND, NOR and XOR.</div>
<h3>NAND gate:<img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/LogicGates_img/Gates/NAND.png" width="173" height="85" alt="NAND-gate" title="NAND-gate"/> <em>not</em> AND</h3>
A NAND gate is a logic gate that behaves exactly like the Boolean operator NAND which is the composition of NOT and AND operators.  The output of the NAND gate is 1 if and only if both of its inputs are 0, just as the output of the Boolean operator NAND is True if and only if both of its inputs are False.  In the truth tables below you can see the correspondence between the Boolean operator NAND and the NAND gate.  In the tables, A and B represent the two binary inputs (False/True and 0/1) which are represented by the two wires going into the NAND gate in the picture shown above.<br /><br />

<h3>NOR gate:<img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/LogicGates_img/Gates/NOR.png" width="180" height="93" alt="NOR-gate" title="NOR-gate"/> <em>not</em> OR</h3>
	A NOR gate is a logic gate that behaves exactly like the Boolean operator NOR which is the composition of NOT and OR operators.  The output of the NOR gate is 1 if and only if both of its inputs are 0, just as the output of the Boolean operator NOR is True if and only if both of its inputs are False.  In the truth tables below you can see the correspondence between the Boolean operator NOR and the NOR gate.  In the tables, A and B represent the two binary inputs (False/True and 0/1) which are represented by the two wires going into the NOR gate in the picture shown above.<br /><br />

<h3>Universal Gates: NAND, NOR</h3>
<p>NAND and NOR gates are called universal gates as each alone can emulate NOT, AND, and OR gates.</p>

<h3>XOR gate:<img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/LogicGates_img/Gates/XOR.png" width="171" height="81" alt="XOR-gate" title="XOR-gate"/> Exclusive OR</h3>
An XOR gate is a logic gate that behaves exactly like the Boolean operator XOR (which stands for "eXclusive OR).  The output of the XOR gate is 1 if and only if either but not both of its inputs are 1, just as the output of the Boolean operator XOR is True if and only if either but not both of its inputs are True.  In the truth tables below you can see the correspondence between the Boolean operator XOR and the XOR gate.  In the tables, A and B represent the two binary inputs (False/True and 0/1) which are represented by the two wires going into the XOR gate in the picture shown above.<br /><br />

A <em>XOR</em> B is logically equivalent to either of these:<br />

<li>A <em>XOR</em> B = (A <em>OR</em> B) <em>AND</em> (<em>NOT</em> (A <em>AND</em> B)) -In English "Either A or B but not both"</li>
<li>A <em>XOR</em> B = (A <em>AND</em> <em>NOT</em> B) <em>OR</em> (<em>NOT</em> A <em>AND</em> B)</li>

<h3>XOR gate from AND, OR, NOT</h3>
You can create the XOR gate from AND, OR and NOT gates as shown below.  This set up follows directly from the logical identity given above:<br />
 A <em>XOR</em> B = (A <em>OR</em> B) <em>AND</em> (<em>NOT</em> (A <em>AND</em> B))<br />
