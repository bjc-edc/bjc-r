		<h2>Binary Sequences</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <strong>2.1</strong> A variety of abstractions built on binary sequences can be used to represent all digital data.<br />
            <strong>2.1.2</strong> Explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data. [P5]<br />
            2.1.2A A finite representation is used to model the infinite mathematical concept of a number. <br />
            2.1.2B In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent characters or integers limits the range of integer values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in overflow or other errors. <em>Exclusion Statement (2.1.2B): Range limitations of any one language, compiler, or architecture are beyond the scope of this course and the AP Exam.</em><br />
            2.1.2C In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers (as floating point numbers) limits the range of floating point values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in round off errors.<br />
            2.1.2D The interpretation of a binary sequence depends on how it is used.<br />
            2.1.2E A sequence of bits may represent instructions or data.<br />
            2.1.2F A sequence of bits may represent different types of data in different contexts.<br />
            6.2.2K The latency of a system is the time elapsed between the transmission and the receipt of a request.<br />
            6.2.2J The bandwidth of a system is a measure of bit rate – the amount of data (measured in bits) that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.

        <div class="vocabBig"><strong>: Binary Sequence</strong>
            <p><em>Every</em> kind of information in the computer—whether it is a number, text, list, or an instruction to perform—is stored as a sequence of 0s and 1s (a <strong>binary sequence</strong>). So, for a program to work, the computer needs to be told how to interpret any such sequence of 0s and 1s.</p>
        </div>

		<p>All data is stored in sequences of binary (ones and zeros), and how any binary sequence is interpreted depends on how it will be used. Binary sequences are used to represent instructions to the computer and various types of data depending on the context.</p>
        <p>Computers store information in binary using <strong>bits</strong> and <strong>bytes</strong>. A bit is a "0" or "1". A byte is eight bits grouped together like 10001001. </p>
		<div class="endnote">Bytes have 8 places, so the left-most place is 2<sup>7</sup> (or 128). Practice what you've learned: What is 10001001<sub>2</sub> in base 10?</div>

		<h3>Storing Integers</h3>
        <p>Depending on the programming language used, an integer might be stored with two or perhaps four bytes of data allowing for a range of about -32,768 to 32,767 (with two bytes) or -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (with four bytes).</p>
        <div class="endnote">
        	<h3 class="box-head">Why are these the ranges for integers?</h3>
            <p>Two bytes is 16 bits, so two bytes can represent 2<sup>16</sup> = 65,536 different values. We use about half of these to represent negative numbers, about half for postive numbers, and one to represent zero.</p>
            <p>Four bytes is 32 bits, so four bytes can represent 2<sup>32</sup> = 4,294,967,296 different values. Again, we use about half for negative numbers, half for postives, and one for zero.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="takeNote"><strong>What about bigger numbers?</strong> Whatever the specific size is for storing integers (two bytes, four bytes, etc.), it will limit the range of the integer values that can be stored and the mathematical operations that can be performed. Values that exceed this limitation may result in errors such as <em>overflow</em> errors because big values overflow the amount of space allocated to store one number.</div>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
				<li>
                    <div class="sidenote">You do not need to learn the factorial function for this class (we are just using it to discuss big numbers), but you will probably see it again in a math class.</div>
                    The <em>factorial</em> of a positive integer <em>n </em>(written "<span class="katex">n!</span>") is the product of all the integers from 1 to <em>n</em>. For example:<br /> 
                    <span class="katex-block">5! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 = 120</span>

        <p><strong>What's going on?</strong> Although <span class="katex">200!</span> is very large, it's not infinite. This report is the result of the size limitation.

            In Snap<em>!</em>, there are special codes for infinity, &ndash;infinity (smaller than any finite value), and "Not a Number," which is the notification used for illegal computations such as <span class="katex">\frac00</span>.<br />

        <h3 class="box-head">Storing Text</h3>
		<div class="sidenoteBig">You can learn more about Unicode if you do the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-cybersecurity/2-caesar-cipher.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Caesar Cipher Project</a> in the Cybersecurity lab, where you create a program to encrypt a message.</div>
        <p>It's common for programming languages to use a <em>specific</em> number of bits to represent Unicode characters or integers. Unicode is a system that allows computers to store letters as integers. For example, capital A is Unicode number 65, which is 01000001<sub>2</sub>.</p>

        
        <h3>Floating Point</h3>
        <!--<div class="sidenoteBig">A floating point value begins with a single <strong>sign bit</strong> (0 for positive or 1 for negative), then it has a specific number of bits for the <strong>exponent</strong>, and it ends with a specific number of bits for the <strong>significand</strong>, which everything after the decimal point. (In binary, the only digit that can be before the decimal in scientific notation is a 1.)</div>-->
        <p>Many languages have another data type used to represent real numbers (including decimals and numbers too big to be stored as integers) called <strong>floating point</strong>, which is essentially a binary version of scientific notation. It's called floating point because the decimal point "floats" to just after the first digit.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="3">
                <li>
                    Try <span class="katex">30!</span>.<br />

                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>That <code>e+32</code> is just a different way to write scientific notation. The "e+" means "times ten to the power of" so: <span class="katex">2.6525285981219103\text{e}+32 = 2.6525285981219103\times10^{32}</span> <span class="katex">=265,252,859,812,191,030,000,000,000,000,000</span>.</p>
        <div class="takeNote">Floating point allows computers to store very large numbers and also decimals, but the format still has a specific number of bits, and that limits the range of floating point values and mathematical operations just like with integers. However with floating point, values that exceed the limitation may result in <em>round off</em> errors instead.</div>
        <p>Most real numbers can't be represented exactly&mdash;even with floating point.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
          <ol start="4">

        </div>
        <p>The decimal representation of <span class="katex">\frac13</span> is 0.33333... It has infinitely many digits, so the closest you can come in floating point isn't <em>exactly</em> <span class="katex">\frac13</span>; it gets cut off after a while.</p>
        <p>Roundoff errors can result in some pretty weird calculations...</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">

            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>This isn't a bug with Snap<em>!</em>. Many other languages (like JavaScript) will report the same values for these calculations.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
        	<p>Computer arithmetic on <em>integers</em> is straightforward. Either you get an exactly correct integer result or, if the result won't fit in integer representation, you get an <em>overflow error</em> and the result is, usually, converted to floating point representation (like <span class="katex">30!</span> was).</p>
            <p>By contrast, computer arithmetic on <em>floating point numbers</em> is hard to get exactly right. Prior to 1985, every model of computer had a slightly different floating point format, and all of them got wrong answers to certain problems. This situation was resolved by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point" target="_blank">IEEE 754 floating point standard</a>, which is now used by every computer manufacturer and has been improved several times since it was created in 1985.</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>How does a programming language know whether to interpret a bit sequence as an integer, a floating point, a text string of Unicode characters, an instruction, or something else?</strong> Programming languages differ in how they do this, but there's always some <em>extra</em> bit sequence that encodes the <em>data type</em> of any sequence of bits that tells the computer how to interpret it.</p>
		<div class="takeNote">At the lowest level of software abstraction, <em>everything</em> in a computer is represented as a binary sequence. For example:

            	<li>A Boolean value is a single bit, 0 for <code>false</code> and 1 for <code>true</code>.</li>
                <li>A text string is a sequence of Unicode character codes, each of which is stored as a separate integer.</li>
                <li>Lists and blocks are binary sequences too.</li>
