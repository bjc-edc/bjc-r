		<title>Unit 6 Lab 1: Computer Abstraction Hierarchy, Page 6</title>
	</head>
<body>
    <div class="todo">
Why this?  This page is about transistors, the level of abstraction below the digital abstraction.
<p>Why here?  There will be three pages, including this one, about the parts of the abstraction hierarchy separated by the two major abstraction barriers, going from top to bottom.</p>
</div>

<H2>Below the Digital Abstraction</H2>

<p>On the previous page we said, as everyone says when talking about computers, that a wire can either have a voltage or not have a voltage on it. But the reality is more complicated. The on-or-off picture of a wire, or a transistor, or a logic gate output, is a simplification — an abstraction. On the previous page we were in the<em> digital domain.</em> On this page, welcome to the <em>analog domain.</em></p>
<p>For the most part, in BJC, if we teach about something at all, we try to do it in depth, so that you come away with a serious understanding. But a deep understanding of transistors requires talking about quantum physics. (There are things called <em>quantum computers,</em> but that's not the point here. Regular old computers are made of transistors, and a transistor works for reasons that you can't really understand without getting into quantum physics.)</p>
<h3>The Transistor</h3>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/curve.es.png" alt="transistor input-output curve"></p>
<p>This is an approximation to the input-output behavior of a transistor. Things to note:</p>
<ul><li>Very small input voltages, up to ½ volt, produce no output at all (0 volts).</li>
<li>From ½ volt to about 7 volts input, the output goes up when the input goes up.  This part of the graph is approximately a straight line.</li>
<li>For more than 7 volts input, the output stays roughly constant.</li></ul>
<p>Transistors are versatile devices. When used in the middle part of the graph, they're <em>amplifiers,</em> and that's how they're used to play music in a stereo. But with a very small input or a very large input, the output is relatively unchanged by small changes. This is how transistors are used as <em>switches,</em> in a computer.
<p>The flatness of the output at the two extremes is important because there <em>will</em> be small changes in the input. Electrical circuits have &quot;noise,&quot; undesired changes in voltages, for reasons from the transistors getting hot to loose connections on the circuit board to cosmic rays. This is why computers use zeros and ones: A transistor has two flat regions in its input-output curve.
<p>But the flatness of the flat regions is only approximate, and it depends on how the transistor is connected to the rest of the circuit. One example of a potential problem is <em>fanout,</em> the number of transistor inputs to which a transistor output is connected.  Beyond a certain number (it depends on the particular transistor type, but certainly ten inputs would be too many), the output voltage is reduced to the point that those inputs might think the voltage is closer to zero than to the fully-on voltage.
<div class="takeNote">
The moral of this story is that the digital domain is not a law of nature; circuit designers have to work at ensuring that each wire in a circuit is always either fully on or fully off.  The digital domain is an abstraction. As with any abstraction, it works only if it's used consistently.</div>
