        <h2>Computer Hardware Basics</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            Hi Selim! I was just going to paste in Paul's paragraph, but then I saw other things to mention. This was not a real review. --MF, 9/25/17<ul>
              <li>From Paul's write-up: "Hardware pages should show parts, including long-term storage chip, in a cell phone. It should also make clear that the touch panel serves both input and output, and that there are other inputs (e.g., buttons) and outputs (e.g., phone jack)." <br>
                ST- ITT 4 (image+text) was created to address the main points of Paul's suggestions: miniaturization and multi-functionality.  If anyone can find better images please let me know.</li>
            	<li>
                    <!--Hi Selim, I was just grabbing images, and I noticed a few things (still not a real review): -->
                    <ul>
                        <!--<li>Alt and title attributes are missing in the images.</li>-->
                        <!--<li>The image credits in the roll-over appear clickable, but they are not, and that seems weird. They either shouldn't look clickable or they should actually be clickable.</li>-->
                        <!--<li>I've never heard it called a "hard disk drive" nor have I heard it called a HDD; that might be right, but no one says that in common speech. I think we should just call it a hard drive.</li>-->
                        <!--<li>
                            I have concerns with problem 2:
                            <ol>
                                <li>How do they know how to answer this?</li>
                                <li>What are they supposed to do? Write it down? Talk about it? If we don't say what to do, they will skip the problem, and then we might as well not have it. Maybe a multiple-multiple-choice quizlet would work here, but only if we can assure ourselves that they'll know how to answer the question. I'm not sure there is a clear answer, and that worries me. Maybe it would work better as a classroom follow-up discussion? Paul may have thoughts on this. I think he raised this point already, and I got it from him.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>-->
                        <!--<li>I like the interactive game, but I have trouble playing it because I never remember that I'm supposed to keep pressing space&mdash;<em>even though</em> it says it at the top of the page (where people don't read) AND it says is at the start of the game. Why not just ask the next question as soon as they get it right?</li>-->
                        <!--<li>We should ask Lauren and Michael about ADA and a roll-over graphic like this. There might be specifications around how this is done. Can you reach out to them? Thanks!</li> A PDF version attached-->

                    Computers used to take up entire rooms as shown here below (ENIAC, 1946).  Nowadays, vastly more powerful computing is available in a hand-sized smartphone where components have been miniaturized and given multiple functionality.  For example the touch screen of the smartphone acts both as an input and an output device.  Do some research on a site like <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/" target="_blank">computerhistory.org</a> and learn about the history of the evolution of computers.  Share your findings with your classmates.<br />

                Pretend you are visiting a computer store to buy computer equipment.  Prepare a list of intelligent talking points and questions to ask the technical specialist at the store to find the best products that suit your needs.  Be sure to use impressive vocabulary such as "RAM", "CPU", "gigahertz", "megabyte" etc.  You will need to do some research to find out the "state of the art" features of top line computer products.

                    One can learn a tremendous amount by taking things apart and putting them back together.  Get your hands on an old abandoned computer and carefully take it apart identifying each component.  There are many online tutorials that can guide you in this process.  Here is one <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/youtube/ctAVC2JwEwI" target="_blank">video tutorial </a>that seems to be popular.<br />

Be sure to unplug the computer before trying to take it apart.  In general, tower computers are safer to take apart and laptops are least safe because the
chemicals in their batteries are highly flammable.</div>
