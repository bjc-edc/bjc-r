            <p>Hmm, I don't actually see many EKs about operating systems, which is weird.  There's this one:</p>
            <p>5.2.1G A process may execute by itself or with other processes.</p>
            <p>Maybe this would be a good place for some of the strange data security ones such as</p>
            <p>3.3.1B Security concerns engender tradeoffs in storing and transmitting information.<br>
              3.3.1H The choice of storage media affects both the methods and costs of manipulating the data it contains.<br>
            3.3.1I Reading data and updating data have different storage requirements.</p>

        <h2>The Software Domain: Operating Systems</h2>
        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll learn about the software that directly manages the computer's hardware, the <em>operating system.</em></div>   
        <p>Your computer came with an <em>operating system</em> (OS) installed. For computers with keyboards, it's probably Linux, MacOS, or Windows. For phones and tablets, it's probably Android or iOS. </p>
        <div class="comment">I think we could clean up the wording on this second paragraph. --MF, 11/8/17</div>
        <p>Roughly speaking, the operating system handles all those basic tasks that your working environment (and nearly every application)  depends on, regardless of whether the application is a word-processor,  music player,  photo-editor,  spreadsheet, game, or browser. These include the window system, which allows more than one window to be open on your screen; the file manager, that displays the contents of folders and lets you select files to read or manipulate;  communications with external devices like your keyboard or printer; and utilities such as a simple text editor or a calculator.</p>
        <p>Many parts of what is called the operating system are actually implemented as application programs. But there are a few system tasks that can't be application programs. They are handled by an operating system <em>kernel,</em> which deals directly with hardware capabilities, and must be written in a low level language.</p>

            <div class="comment">I question if this is really a "takenote" situation. I think of those as being critical info. This is definitely interesting, but I'm not sure that it's <em>that</em> important for students. --MF, 11/8/17</div>
            <strong>Operating system kernel tasks:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Scheduling.</strong>  In a computer there are many application programs all wanting to run at once. The OS has access to the time clock that's built into the hardware and lets each program run for a small amount of time (typically about 1/10 second) and then switches to the next program in line.</li>
                <li><strong>Security.</strong> Those many application programs may have bugs. The OS, which has access to the <em>memory management</em> hardware of the computer,  ensures that each program is assigned a separate location in memory, and uses only the memory allocated to it so it doesn't interfere with other memory.  The OS also controls which data files a program can use, based on <em>file protection</em> settings that you can specify for each file.</li>
                <li> <strong>Input and output.</strong> Many  devices can be attached to your computer.  (Some, like the primary disk storage, may be inside the computer case.)  <em>Input</em> devices include the keyboard, mouse, and  microphone.  <em>Output</em> devices include the printer, speaker, and, for laptop or desktop computers, the display screen.  Touchscreens on phones and tablets are used both for input and for output. So are disk drives, optical drives (for CDs and DVDs), and the Internet interface.  The OS knows how the computer's hardware reads or writes to each of these. Only the kernel is allowed direct access to these devices, and it carries out authorized transfers of information for the applications.

            	<li>Find out how to list all the programs that are running right now on your computer, and collect such a program list in a text file.  Then count how many of them are programs <em>you</em> asked the computer to run.  Of the rest, can you figure out from the names what they do?  Which ones are part of the operating system (not the OS kernel)?  See if you can figure out the purpose of some obscurely-named ones by doing a web search.</li>
            </ol>

        <p>These days, OS kernels are remarkably similar. Of the five systems listed earlier (Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, and iOS), four of them (all but Windows) are based on variants of a single kernel, called Unix.</p>

                <p>("Unix" is a trademark, currently owned by The Open Group, and not all of the variants discussed here are authorized to use that name, but they all provide essentially the same program interface.) Unix was created around 1970 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.</p>
                <p>Prior to Unix, almost everyone thought that an operating system had to be developed for a particular computer architecture, and had to be written in the machine language of that computer, the very low-level instructions that the hardware understands directly. The  first version of Unix was also written in the machine language of a particular computer, the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-7. But the Unix developers knew that the PDP-7 wasn't the only computer in the world, and better ones would come along, so they wanted to make Unix <em>portable,</em> meaning that it could be brought to a new computer architecture without a complete rewrite.  So in 1972 Dennis Ritchie invented the C programming language for that purpose.  C is similar to other languages available at the time, but with one added feature: a C programmer can read or write any individual byte of the program's memory by knowing its <em>address,</em> a number that distinguishes it from other bytes.  (You can see that this feature is quite the opposite from high level abstraction.  It is useful only to a programmer who's thinking in detail about what's where in the computer's memory.) Unix was then rewritten in C.</p>
                <p>Because of its portability, Unix spread quickly to many computer architectures. Researchers at Berkeley developed a version, based on the AT&amp;T version, with <em>virtual memory,</em> the ability to run a program that's only partly in the computer's main memory, with the rest kept on a disk. This Berkeley version is the direct ancestor of Apple's operating systems, MacOS (since MacOS 10.0) and iOS. (An Apple computer doesn't behave anything like a Unix computer, but the differences are almost all in application-level programs, not in the kernel.) Android, Google's operating system for cell phones and tablets, is based on Linux, a complete rewrite of Unix originally written by Linus Torvalds, who was, at the time, a computer science student in Finland.</p>
                <p>The application-level programs that were part of the original Unix package have, in most systems, been replaced with rewritten programs from the Free Software Foundation's GNU (an acronym for Gnu's Not Unix) package.</p>
