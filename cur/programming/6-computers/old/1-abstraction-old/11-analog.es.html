        <h3>The Analog Domain: Transistors</h3>
        <div class="comment">We shouldn't state facts here. This isn't a place to learn stuff, this is a signpost for what you will be learning. --MF, 11/8/17</div>
        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong> you'll learn that the "ones and zeros" in a computer are an abstraction; the actual transistors that implement logic gates are more complicated devices.</div>
        <p>On the previous pages you learned that a wire can either have a voltage or not have a voltage on it. But the reality is more complicated. The on-or-off picture of a wire, or a transistor, or a logic gate output, is a simplification — an abstraction. On the previous page we were in the<em> digital domain.</em> On this page, welcome to the <em>analog domain.</em></p>

        <h3>The Transistor</h3>
        <img height="220" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/transistor-curve.es.png" alt="transistor input-output behavior curve">
        <p>This is a rough graph of the input-output behavior of a transistor.  You don't have to worry about any of the details; just take note of the two blue <em>flat</em> parts of the graph. </p>
        <div class="commentBig">I find everything I'd read about transistors as amplifiers in this lab both intriguing and confusing. Let's find a way to be clearer. The rest of this paragraph isn't clear either. --MF, 11/8/17</div>
        <p>Transistors are versatile devices. When used in the middle (linear) part of the graph, they're <em>amplifiers,</em> and that's how they're used to play music in a stereo. But with a very small input (cutoff) or a very large input (saturation), the output is relatively unchanged by small changes. This is how transistors are used as <em>switches,</em> in a computer.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <a href="#hint-digital-abstraction" data-toggle="collapse">Learn more about what's below the digital abstraction.</a>
            <div id="hint-digital-abstraction" class="collapse">
                <p>The flatness of the output at the two extremes is important because there <em>will</em> be small changes in the input. Electrical circuits have "noise," undesired changes in voltages, for reasons from the transistors getting hot to loose connections on the circuit board to cosmic rays. This is why computers use zeros and ones: A transistor has two flat regions in its input-output curve.</p>
                <div class="comment">I think we could make this second paragraph clearer. --MF, 11/8/17</div>
                <p>But the flatness of the flat regions is only approximate, and it depends on how the transistor is connected to the rest of the circuit. One example of a potential problem is <em>fanout,</em> the number of transistor inputs to which one transistor's output is connected.  Beyond a certain number (it depends on the particular transistor type, but certainly ten inputs would be too many), the output voltage is reduced to the point that those inputs might not be sure whether they're getting a zero or a one.</p>
                <h4>How the Transistor Works</h4>
                <div class="comment">Let's not ever say this (we aren't going to tell you). Why mention it at all? I'd cut. --MF, 11/8/17</div>
                <p>We really can't get into that in this course. The ultimate answer is that it depends on quantum physics. (We're not talking about <em>quantum computers;</em> plain old computer circuits are based on quantum effects also.) To learn more about analog-domain circuit design and what's inside a transistor, take an Electrical Engineering course.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="todo">This is orange as though it is important, but it will almost assurdedly be lost here. Let's work on integrating the core ideas into the above. --MF, 11/8/17</div>
		<div class="takeNote">The moral of this story is that the digital domain is not a law of nature; circuit designers have to work at ensuring that each wire in a circuit is always either fully on or fully off.  The digital domain is an abstraction. As with any abstraction, it works only if it's used consistently.</div>
