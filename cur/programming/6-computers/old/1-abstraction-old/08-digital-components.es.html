        <h2>The Digital Domain: Components</h2>
        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page</strong> you'll explore the <em>parts</em> (components) of the computer hardware.</div>
        
        <p>For as long as people have been teaching other people about computers,  they always say  "A computer consists of the processor, memory, and input/output (I/O) devices." </p>
        <p>
            In the early days of computers, it was easy to point out the huge racks of equipment that contained each of those three components:<br />
            <img class="indent" width="400px" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/pdp-10.jpg" alt="Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 Processor and Memory" title="Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 Processor and Memory">

        </p>
        <p>These are pictures of a powerful computer from the 1970s. Each of the big racks full of circuitry is about the size of a refrigerator.  Today, a much more powerful computer—more speed, more memory—fits inside a cell phone.</p>
        <p>Because today's processors and memory are so small, most of what we see is the I/O devices, like keyboard, mouse, screens.</p>

Research what features of the computer are most important for your purpose, choose a computer, and compare notes with others. Which computer is most expensive? Least expensive? Did you choose a laptop or a desktop, and why?
