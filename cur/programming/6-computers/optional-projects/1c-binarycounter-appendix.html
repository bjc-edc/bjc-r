        <h3>Base Conversion with Method 1 (<em>Short Division by Two with Remainder</em>)</h3>
        <p>First a reminder how to extract each digit in base 10 system.</p>
        <p>
        	<strong>Example:</strong> If you were trying to extract the digits of a number, say, 527 in base 10, you would take the following steps.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/BinaryClock_img/527.png" width="459" alt="Decimal Digit Extraction" title="Decimal Digit Extraction" /><br />
            (Recall that the floor() function rounds a number down to the closest integer.)<br />
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Find the “ones” digit, via remainder in 527 divided by 10: <br />
                    527 mod 10 = <strong>7</strong><br />
                    Get quotient:<br />
                    floor(527/10)= 52
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat, find the “tens” digit, via remainder in 52 divided by 10: <br />
                    52 mod 10 = <strong>2</strong><br />
                    Get quotient:<br />
                    floor(52/10) = 5
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat, find the “hundreds” digit, via remainder in 5 divided by 10: <br />
                    5 mod 10 = <strong>5</strong><br />
                    Get quotient:<br />
                    floor(5/10) = 0
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>This is where we stop. So 527= <strong>5</strong>(100) + <strong>2</strong>(10) + <strong>7</strong>(1)</p>
        <p>Note with the algorithm we extracted the digits right to left. (7 first, 2 next, 5 last)</p>
        
        <p>
        	<strong>Example:</strong> If you apply a similar procedure to get the binary representation of a number, say, 25, you would take the following steps.<br />
        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/BinaryClock_img/25.png" width="747" alt="Binary Digit Extraction" title="Binary Digit Extraction" /><br />
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Find the “ones” digit, via remainder in 25 divided by 2: <br />
                    25 mod 2 = <strong>1</strong><br />
                    Get quotient:<br />
                    floor(25/2)= 12
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat, find the “twos” digit, via remainder in 12 divided by 2: <br />
                    12 mod 2= <strong>0</strong><br />
                    Get quotient:<br />
                    floor(12/2)= 6
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat, find the “fours” digit, via remainder in 6 divided by 2: <br />
                    6 mod 2= <strong>0</strong><br />
                    Get quotient:<br />
                    floor(6/2)= 3
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat, find the “eights” digit, via remainder in 3 divided by 2: <br />
                    3 mod 2= <strong>1</strong><br />
                    Get quotient:<br />
                floor(3/2)= 1
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat, find the “sixteens” digit, via remainder in 1 divided by 2: <br />
                    1 mod 2= <strong>1</strong><br />
                    Get quotient:<br />
                    floor(1/2)= 0
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>This is where we stop. Note with the algorithm again we extracted the digits right to left.</p>
        <p>So 25= <strong>1</strong>(16) + <strong>1</strong>(8)+ <strong>0</strong>(4) + <strong>0</strong>(2) + <strong>1</strong>(1) = (<strong>11001</strong>)<sub>2</sub></p>
        <p>Using these examples come up with an algorithm to represent any base 10 number in base 2.</p>

		<b>Example:</b> If you are trying to get the binary representation of a number, say, 25, you would take the following steps.<br>

<pre  style="width:400px">
Is 2<sup>4</sup> =16 contained in 25? Yes, write <b>1</b>.
25-16=9
Is 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 contained in  9? Yes, write <b>1</b>.
9-8=1
Is 2<sup>2</sup> = 4 contained in  1? No,  write <b>0</b>.
Is 2<sup>1</sup> = 2 contained in  1? No,  write <b>0</b>.
Is 2<sup>0</sup> = 1 contained in  1? Yes, write <b>1</b>.
1-1=0  Done.
