        <h3>Half-Adder</h3>
        <div class="todo">		<p>Boolean Operators each take two Boolean values (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) as input and report a single bit (a single Boolean value) as output. This is <em>unlike</em> the basic operations used in math. For example in addition, the sum of two single-bit values can have a <em>two</em>-bit result: 1 + 1 = 10 in binary. So things like arithmetic circuitry are built out of Boolean circuitry.</p>
</div>
		
        <p>A half-adder adds two binary digits (with no <em><strong>carry in</strong></em>) and reports the sum and the <em><strong>carry out </strong></em> value.  If you look at the "SUM" column you will notice that it is identical to the output column of XOR and if you look at the "CARRY" column you will notice that it is identical to the output column of AND.</p>

            If you are having difficulty making sense of this table consider addition of binary digits:<br />
            0+0=0<br />0+1=1<br />1+0=1<br />1+1=2 which is 10 in binary with a units digit sum of 0 and a carry of 1.

        <pre><!--If the logic gate projects are addressing EKs not otherwise addressed, then
they're not optional.

I don't think there's a hyphen in "AND gate" etc.  Ditto "logic gate" later.

"Computers only deal with data in the form of the binary numbers 0 and 1..."
No!  At the very lowest level, computer circuitry is made of wires, and by
virtue of the digital abstraction, each wire is either on or off.  But there
are lots of wires in a circuit.  What I think this paragraph is trying to say
is that at the lowest level, circuits operate on the values in individual
wires.  What operations apply to single-bit values?  Logical operations.  For
example, A AND B, where A and B are Boolean values, reports a single Boolean
value.  This is unlike addition, for example, in which the sum of two
single-bit values can have a two-bit result: 1+1=10 binary.  So things like
arithmetic circuitry are built out of Boolean circuitry.
(In the existing paragraph, "binary" is used to mean "single-bit," after pages
and pages of converting numbers to and from binary.)

"... just like the output..." should be "just as the output."

In general, the gate sections throw around bunches of metaphors that aren't
obviously metaphors.  Some of them, I think, should just be thrown out, namely
the series/parallel
switches, which don't have inputs and outputs, so it's not clear how they're
like gates.

The important metaphor is the correspondence 0=False, 1=True.  But it requires
explanation.  Remind students about type tags, needed because the same on/off
values can be used to represent many different kinds of data.  In Snap!, the
Boolean operators are defined only for the specific values False and True, each
of which is represented by a single bit /plus a type tag/.  Off/on can also
represent 0 and 1 in the context of an /integer type tag/.

All this type tagging is done in software, not hardware.  The hardware knows
only that a particular wire is off or on.  Hardware designers represent those
as 0 or 1 in circuit diagrams, regardless of the data type a user intends.  So
an AND gate, for example, is generally represented by a table using 0 and 1,
like [figure].  But if you remember that 0 is the same value (without type tag)
as False, and 1 is the same as True, you can see that this is equivalent to a
table expressed in terms of Boolean values: [figure].

Do New Yorkers know what a hedge trimmer is?

For OR gates, include the obligatory paragraph about how sometimes in human
conversation the word "or" is used with an implicit "... but not both," but in
computer circuitry we always mean /inclusive/ or.

For NOT gates, /do not/, absolutely do not, suggest the metaphor of short
circuiting a power supply!  This is horribly dangerous if students actually
read it and take it seriously.  This is the main reason I want you not to use
series/parallel switch analogies at all.  But if you were to do so, the
metaphor would be a normally-on switch:

unpressed switch:
           |
           |
           V
-------o-----o-------(bulb) etc.

pressed switch:


-------o     o--------
          \
           \
            \

About the project files for this page and the next:  Again, you have done all
of the work for the students.  All of those "use these blocks" things should be
flushed, as should the IF/ELSE in the forever loop.


NAND, NOR, XOR:

I'm not sure what this adds to the previous page other than a little
vocabulary.  It's mathematically interesting that a single kind of gate can
simulate all the others if it's NAND or NOR, but not AND or OR because you
can't use those to build negation.    But you only half-make
that point, showing how NAND can simulate the others (instead of having the
students do it!!!), but /not/ showing (or having them show) that you can't do
it with AND or OR.

Because I like math, I would be tempted to explain that there are only 16
possible Boolean functions of two inputs, because there are only 16 truth
tables.  Students could then write out all 16, and give them names, or look up
the PDP-10 instruction set, which included all 16.  But none of that has any
practical value -- although back in the day, I found uses for almost all of
them in PDP-10 programs.-->


Binary addition:

I think this is kind of backwards.  It introduces "carry out" and "carry in" as
technical terms before indicating why they're important, namely, adding more
than one-bit-wide numbers.

1.  Do a base 10 addition that involves carrying, and introduce the idea that,
e.g., the "carry out" from the tens column is the "carry in" to the hundreds
column.

2.  Do the same thing in binary, with the difference that the carry signals are
just a single wire wide.

3.  Show a single-bit slice of the addition to show that the + circuit needs
/three/ inputs and /two/ outputs.

4.  Draw a ripple adder, to show how the Carry Out from one bit slice becomes
the Carry In for the next-left bit slice.

5.  Now you're ready to say that the traditional way to build a one-bit-wide
adder is to start with a circuit called a half-adder that has a carry out but
no carry in.

6.  Draw this picture:

              +----------+
      A ----->|          |-----> Sum
              |half adder|
      B ----->|          |-----> Carry Out
              +----------+

and then /have the students build it!/  No leading them by the nose ring.  If
you must, have a /hidden/ hint that just says "Draw a truth table for Sum and
another truth table for Carry Out."

7.  Show the figure with two half adders cascaded, but leaving out the OR gate
and the three output labels.  Have the students draw the rest of the circuit,
after reminding them that they're supposed to produce two outputs, Sum and
Carry Out.  Also remind them that /each half-adder/ has outputs called Sum and
Carry Out, and that the full adder has its own outputs with the same name, and
all three are distinct.

I think it should say someplace that computers today don't really use these
simple ripple carry circuits because they're too slow; each bit has to wait for
the bit to its right before it can figure out its own output.  So, TIF A:  How
do computers /really/ add binary integers?

TIF B has two parts, each with pitfalls.  To do subtraction, you really have to
first understand twos complement.  As for multiplication, as I said earlier,
there's the simple way (shift and add), and then there's the real way (much
more complicated, involving, I think, table lookup for slices of four or eight
bits).</pre>

<h3>NAND gate:<img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/LogicGates_img/Gates/NAND.png" width="173" height="85" alt="NAND-gate" title="NAND-gate"/> <em>not</em> AND</h3>
A NAND gate is a logic gate that behaves exactly like the Boolean operator NAND which is the composition of NOT and AND operators.  The output of the NAND gate is 1 if and only if both of its inputs are 0, just as the output of the Boolean operator NAND is True if and only if both of its inputs are False.  In the truth tables below you can see the correspondence between the Boolean operator NAND and the NAND gate.  In the tables, A and B represent the two binary inputs (False/True and 0/1) which are represented by the two wires going into the NAND gate in the picture shown above.<br /><br />



<h3>NOR gate:<img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/LogicGates_img/Gates/NOR.png" width="180" height="93" alt="NOR-gate" title="NOR-gate"/> <em>not</em> OR</h3>
	A NOR gate is a logic gate that behaves exactly like the Boolean operator NOR which is the composition of NOT and OR operators.  The output of the NOR gate is 1 if and only if both of its inputs are 0, just as the output of the Boolean operator NOR is True if and only if both of its inputs are False.  In the truth tables below you can see the correspondence between the Boolean operator NOR and the NOR gate.  In the tables, A and B represent the two binary inputs (False/True and 0/1) which are represented by the two wires going into the NOR gate in the picture shown above.<br /><br />

   
<h3>Universal Gates: NAND, NOR</h3>
<p>NAND and NOR gates are called universal gates as each alone can emulate NOT, AND, and OR gates.</p>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="second">
<ol start="5">
<li>In the animation below you can see how NAND gates are used to respectively emulate NOT, AND and OR gates.  Explain how these work.  How can you similarly use only NOR gates to emulate NOT, AND and OR gates?</li>

<h3>XOR gate:<img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/LogicGates_img/Gates/XOR.png" width="171" height="81" alt="XOR-gate" title="XOR-gate"/> Exclusive OR</h3>
An XOR gate is a logic gate that behaves exactly like the Boolean operator XOR (which stands for "eXclusive OR).  The output of the XOR gate is 1 if and only if either but not both of its inputs are 1, just as the output of the Boolean operator XOR is True if and only if either but not both of its inputs are True.  In the truth tables below you can see the correspondence between the Boolean operator XOR and the XOR gate.  In the tables, A and B represent the two binary inputs (False/True and 0/1) which are represented by the two wires going into the XOR gate in the picture shown above.<br /><br />



A <em>XOR</em> B is logically equivalent to either of these:<br />
<ul>
<li>A <em>XOR</em> B = (A <em>OR</em> B) <em>AND</em> (<em>NOT</em> (A <em>AND</em> B)) -In English "Either A or B but not both"</li>
<li>A <em>XOR</em> B = (A <em>AND</em> <em>NOT</em> B) <em>OR</em> (<em>NOT</em> A <em>AND</em> B)</li>
</ul>

		 	

<h3>XOR gate from AND, OR, NOT</h3>
You can create the XOR gate from AND, OR and NOT gates as shown below.  This set up follows directly from the logical identity given above:<br />
 A <em>XOR</em> B = (A <em>OR</em> B) <em>AND</em> (<em>NOT</em> (A <em>AND</em> B))<br />

<h3>Half-Adder</h3>
<p>A half-adder adds two binary digits and reports the sum and the carry over value.  If you look at the "SUM" column you will notice that it is identical to the output column of XOR and if you look at the "CARRY" column you will notice that it is identical to the output column of AND.</p>
