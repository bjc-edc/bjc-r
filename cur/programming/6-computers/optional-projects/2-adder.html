<h2>Binary Addition with Logic Gates</h2>
<div class="learn"><strong>On this page,</strong> you will catch a glimpse of how computers do basic arithmetic operations such as addition using only binary digits and logic gates.</div>
<h3>Review: Addition of numbers</h3>
<p>When you add two numbers in the decimal system (base 10) you evaluate each column of addition by taking into consideration any <em><strong>carry in</strong></em> value from the previous column and then passing on to the next column any <em><strong>carry out</strong></em> value.</p>
<img  class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/LogicGates_img/Adders/DecimalAddition.png" width="500" alt=""/><br />

<p>The exact same procedure is followed when you add two numbers in the binary system (base 2) as shown below.</p>
<img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/LogicGates_img/Adders/BinaryAddition.png"  width="500" alt=""/><br />
As you can see in order to perform the addition of numbers you must be able to accomodate inputting a <em><strong>carry in</strong></em> value and outputting a <em><strong>carry out</strong></em> value.

<h3>Half-Adder</h3>
<p>A half-adder adds two binary digits (with no <em><strong>carry in</strong></em>) and reports the sum and the <em><strong>carry out </strong></em> value.  If you look at the "SUM" column you will notice that it is identical to the output column of XOR and if you look at the "CARRY" column you will notice that it is identical to the output column of AND.</p>
<div class="sidenote">If you are having difficulty making sense of this table consider addition of binary digits:<br />
0+0=0<br />0+1=1<br />1+0=1<br />1+1=2 which is 10 in binary with a units digit sum of 0 and a carry of 1.</div>

<h3>Full-Adder</h3>
<div class="sidenote">If you are having difficulty making sense of this table consider addition of three binary digits:<br />
<img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/LogicGates_img/Adders/Full-Adder-Helper.png"  height="200" alt="Sum of three bits" title="Sum of three bits"/><br />
For example, 1+1+1=3 which is 11 in binary with a ones digit of 1 and a carry out value of 1.</div>
<p>A full-adder uses two half-adders to perform a full addition of binary digits accomodating a <em><strong>carry in</strong></em> value.  It reports the sum and <em><strong>carry out </strong></em> value.</p>

  	<li>Study the table and the full-adder schematic given above to explain how the full-adder performs the addition of two binary numbers with a <em><strong>carry in</strong></em> using two half-adders and an OR gate.</li>

    <li>Examine the Snap<em>!</em> file and all its sprites.  Code for sprites <code>CARRY IN</code>, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, have been written for you.  For the sprites <code>SUM1</code>, <code>CARRY1</code>, <code>SUM OUT</code>, <code>CARRY2</code>, <code>CARRY OUT</code>, assemble some code blocks to emulate a full-adder.</li>

Learn about <em>ripple carry adders</em> and explain how they use full-adders to add multi-digit binary numbers. Build a Snap<em>!</em> program to emulate the addition of two 4-digit binary numbers with a <em>ripple carry adder</em>.
