		<title>Unit 6 Lab 1: Computer Abstraction Hierarchy, Page 4</title>
	</head>
    <body>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>Why this?  This page is about the two levels of abstraction above the program abstraction, from the chart on page 1.</p>
            <p>Why here?  There will be three pages, including this one, about the parts of the abstraction hierarchy separated by the two major abstraction barriers, going from top to bottom.</p>
            <p>2.1.2B In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent characters or integers limits the range of integer values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in overflow or other errors.<br />
            2.1.2C In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers (as floating point numbers) limits the range of floating point values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in roundoff errors<br />
            2.2.3A Different programming languages offer different levels of abstraction.<br />
            2.2.3B High level programming languages provide more abstractions for the programmer and make it easier for people to read and write a program.<br />
            5.5.1B Integers may be constrained in the maximum and minimum values that can be represented in a program because of storage limitations.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Software Domain</h2>
        <p>Mostly, when we talk about software, we mean application programs (&quot;apps&quot; for short) and the operating system (often OS for short). 
Roughly, apps are the programs that <em>we</em> interact with (text editors, photo editors, calculators, music players, browsers, Snap<em>!</em>, etc.)  and operating systems are the programs that the apps interact with (like Mac OS or Microsoft Windows) to communicate with the computer.</p>
        
<h3>Application Software</h3>
        <p>Just to display a picture on your screen involves a lot of complexity. An app must find out the size of the picture (usually expressed in "pixels," short for "picture elements"). Each pixel is represented by numbers, usually three (or four)  integers between 0 and 255. Not all representations  use those numbers the same way. In probably the most common system (RGB), the  three numbers represent the intensity of   Red,  Green,  and Blue in that pixel. When all are 0, we see black; when all are 255, we see white; if R is 0, G is 120, and B is 0, we see a dark green; other combinations make other colors.  </p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <a href="#hint-color-codes" data-toggle="collapse">Click here to learn more about Color Codes.</a>
          <div id="hint-color-codes" class="collapse">If a fourth number is used, it represents the <em>transparency,</em> like the ghost effect you used in your very first BJC project. RGB works well for lights, such as the tiny lights in your screen so it is great for computers,  but not good for printers. Ink or paint colors are measured in CMYK: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black. And some colors such as brown and brick-red (darker than pure red) are hard to figure out in RGB units, even for display in lights. Another color system is called HSB, for <em>hue, saturation, brightness.</em> Snap<em>!</em>'s system is similar to HSB: "pen color" is hue (location on the rainbow); "pen shade" is more or less saturation (zero means black, 100 means full rainbow color).  </div>
</div>
        <p>And there are many ways (file formats like BMP, PNG, GIF, and JPG or JPEG) to store the picture information in long-term memory.  These formats differ in compression (more on that below) and in how the computer finds the <em>dimensions</em> of the picture (width and height, in pixels).</p>
    <p>The application also has to know how to put the picture up on the actual screen.</p>
        <p>All  the other tasks a program may have to carry out—for example, knowing where the mouse pointer is—have complex parts.</p>
        <p>If application programmers had to deal with all of these details in every program, no software would ever get developed. Instead, programming languages provide  abstractions that make certain tasks easier—&quot;tools&quot; that differ from language to language—that save the programmer from inventing them. For example, what happens if an application programmer wants a little picture to be able to move around in a screen that also has other pictures in it? In Snap<em>!</em>, that's built in: import a picture as a <em>costume</em> that can be attached to a sprite, and then  move the picture by moving the sprite. Not all languages  include a sprite abstraction. Moreover, some programmers write <em>libraries</em> that add to the built-in tool set, so that other programmers can just use the tools in their programs. You've used Snap<em>!</em> libraries in some projects. </p>
        
<h4><strong>Data Compression</strong></h4>
        <p>Why <em>are</em> there so many picture formats, anyway? One  reason is the usefulness of different <strong>data compression algorithms</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            Here's a picture of the BJC logo:<br />
            <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/bjc-logo-original.png" alt="BJC logo uncompressed" title="BJC logo uncompressed" />
        </p>
        <p>This picture is 158 pixels wide, and 186 pixels tall, for a total of 29,388 pixels. The BMP (bitmap) format includes each of those pixels in the picture file, at four bytes per pixel, so the file size is about 120kB.</p>
        <p>This is an inefficient way to store the information. That's especially true for a cartoon-like picture such as this one. Think about the 158 pixels in the top row. </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/top-row-of-pixels-in-bjc-logo.png" alt="top-row-of-pixels-in-bjc-logo">...</p>
        <p>The first 60 or so are transparent. Then come five pixels of mustard yellow (the top slice of the "b").The rest are transparent. So instead of storing a representation for all 158 pixels, we could just store the number 60, the code for &quot;transparent,&quot; the number 5, the code for &quot;mustard yellow,&quot; and the number 93 (to finish the row), and the code for transparent—six pieces of information instead of 158. This is called <em>run-length encoding</em>.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <a href="#hint-run-length-encoding" data-toggle="collapse">Click to learn more about run-length encoding.</a>
      <div id="hint-run-length-encoding" class="collapse">
       The run-length encoding for      that top row is:
<ul>
                    <li>A four-byte number of pixels (60).</li>
                    <li>The four-byte representation for a transparent pixel.</li>
                    <li>A four-byte number of pixels (5).</li>
                    <li>The four-byte representation for that mustard-yellow color.</li>
                    <li>A four-byte number of pixels to finish the row (93).</li>
                    <li>The four-byte representation for a transparent pixel.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Not all the rows are that simple. A slice across the picture near the top of the <em>j</em> looks like this.<br /> 
        ... <img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/bjc-logo-original-middle-row.png" alt="bjc-logo-original-middle-row"> ... <br /> 
        Storing the length of each  color run would require 24 pieces of information. But even this is better than 158. </p>
                <p>These days, the size of one picture isn't so significant, but think about every frame of a movie, and think about the time required to send the information over the Internet. Compression makes it easier to stream that movie to you.</p>
</div>
        </div>
        <p>Run-length encoding doesn't <em>lose</em> any information. The original picture can be reconstructed with every pixel exactly correct. This is an example of <em>lossless compression.</em></p>

		</div>
        <p>Run-length encoding doesn't do  well if the picture is a photograph, in which every pixel may be slightly different in color from its neighbors.  (If the length of each color run is just one pixel, storing just the colors uses half the information than storing both run length <em>and</em> color.) So there are other compression algorithms. The PNG  (Portable Network Graphics, pronounced "ping") encoding does <em>lossless</em> compression of arbitrary pictures. Its algorithm is complicated, using several different strategies depending on how  color varies in each small chunk of the image. The thing to remember is that PNG is lossless.</p>
<p>Some   algorithms use <strong>lossy compression</strong>. This lets file size  be even smaller, but the original picture can't be perfectly reconstructed; information is lost. This would be terrible if these algorithms were used to compress a computer program or a novel, but people's perception of pictures does not  require extreme precision.</p>
        <p>The most commonly used lossy compression algorithm for pictures is called JPEG (or JPG, both pronounced "jay peg") for "Joint Photographic Experts Group," the commitee that invented it. Lossy algorithms usually let you control the degree of precision. Below are two versions of a picture measuring 512×384 pixels and the file sizes in various formats.</p>
        <table width="56%" border="4" cellspacing="8" summary="compression factors example">
          <tr>
                <th scope="col">format</th>
                <th scope="col">size</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>BMP (encoding every pixel individually)</td>
                <td>590 kB</td>

            <tr>
                <td>JPEG set at &quot;worst&quot; in the Preview app on a Mac</td>
                <td>21 kB</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          Notice how tiny the JPEG worst file is! It must look terrible, right? Here are a section from that 21kB file and the original, uncompressed BMP file. Can you tell which is which?<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/pond.bmp" alt="pond pebbles" title="pond pebbles" />
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/pond.jpg" alt="pond pebbles" title="pond pebbles" />
        </p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Lossy vs. Lossless</strong>
            <p><strong>Lossless</strong> compression (like PNG) is <em>reversible</em> (no loss in quality); you can reconstruct the original data. It works by removing redundant data.</p>
            <p><strong>Lossy</strong> compression (like JPG) is <em>not</em> fully reversible; you can only reconstruct an <em>approximation</em> of the original data. It works by removing irrelevant data (details that people aren't likely to notice).</p>

            <p>There are trade-offs: lossless compression maintains the original data but might not be able to compress the data much or at all; lossy compression often results in a smaller file but may have lower quality.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4><strong>High and Low Level Languages</strong></h4>
        <p>A <em>high level language</em>  includes many abstractions that make it easier to talk about the problem you want to solve rather than talk about how the computer hardware works. (The sprite abstraction is one example.) A <em>low level language</em> has few abstractions, requiring you to know a lot about the architecture of your computer to write a program for it.</p>
    <p>So why would anyone ever want to use a low level language? The best answer is "in order to write an operating system."</p>
        <div class="endnote">
        	<a href="#hint-low-level-lang" data-toggle="collapse">There are also "less-good" reasons.</a>
			<div id="hint-low-level-lang" class="collapse">
            	<p>Application programmers don't  decide "I'm going to write this program in a low level language." They may simply not realize that higher levels of abstraction are possible. For example,  a  computer's hardware limits the size of numbers that its arithmetic unit can add in a single step. Four billion—about ten digits—is a common size limit for integers. Programmers who use Java, Javascript, Python, C or C++ may think that this limit is unavoidable. But programmers who use <em>really</em> high level languages, such as Scheme or Common Lisp, know that they can do arithmetic on numbers with millions or billions of digits, limited only by the size of the computer's memory. As you will see later, Snap<em>!</em> has a library that lets it do this, too.</p>
        		<p><em>Programmers may think that abstraction is too slow.</em> Programmers of 3-D video games  need all the speed they can get; their programs strain the speed of modern computers. So they often write part of their programs, the part that actually puts pictures on the screen, in low-level languages, just for speed. But most programmers  write applications that don't strain computers at all. When you send an email or text message, the limiting factor  is how fast you can type, not how fast your computer can run programs. Sometimes an abstraction gets a reputation for slowness because 50 years ago, when the abstraction was first invented by  researchers, it really did strain the computers of the day; old programmers may continue to tell young programmers how slow it is, even though today's computers are millions of times as fast.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
        <p>Your computer came with an <em>operating system</em> (OS) installed, probably Linux, MacOS, or Windows for computers with keyboards, and Android or iOS for phones and tablets.</p>
        <p>Many parts of what is called the operating system are actually implemented as application programs: the window system, which allows more than one window to be open on your screen; the file manager, that displays the contents of folders and lets you select files to read or manipulate; and utilities such as a simple text editor or a calculator. But there are a few system tasks that can't be application programs, and they are handled by an operating system <em>kernel,</em> which deals directly with hardware capabilities, and must be written in a low level language.</p>
        <div class="takeNote">
            <strong>Operating system kernel tasks:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Scheduling.</strong>  In a computer there are many application programs all wanting to run at once. The OS, which has access to the time clock that's built into the hardware, lets each program run for a small amount of time (typically about 1/10 second) and then switches to the next program in line.</li>
                <li><strong>Security.</strong> Those many application programs may have bugs. The OS, which has access to the <em>memory management</em> hardware of the computer,  ensures that each program is assigned a separate location in memory, and uses only the memory allocated to it so it doesn't interfere with other memory.  The OS also controls which data files a program can use, based on <em>file protection</em> settings you can apply to each file.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Input and output.</strong> Many  devices can be attached to your computer.  (Some, like the primary disk storage, may be inside the computer case.)  <em>Input</em> devices include the keyboard, mouse, and  microphone.  <em>Output</em> devices include the printer, speaker, and, for desktop computers, the display screen.  Touchscreens on phones and tablets are used both for input and for output. So are disk drives, optical drives (for CDs and DVDs), and the Internet interface.  The OS know how the computer's hardware reads or writes to each of these. Only the kernel is allowed direct access to these devices, and it carries out authorized transfers of information for the applications.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" type="first">
            <ol>
            	<li>Find out how to list all the programs that are running right now on your computer, and collect such a program list in a text file.  Then count how many of them are programs <em>you</em> asked the computer to run.  Of the rest, can you figure out from the names what they do?  Which ones are part of the operating system (not the OS kernel)?  See if you can figure out the purpose of some obscurely-named ones by doing a web search.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>These days, OS kernels are remarkably similar. Of the five systems listed earlier (Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, and iOS), four of them (all but Windows) are based on variants of a single system, called Unix.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <a href="#hint-unix" data-toggle="collapse">Click here to read more about Unix.</a>
            <div id="hint-unix" class="collapse">
                <p>("Unix" is a trademark, currently owned by The Open Group, and not all of the variants discussed here are authorized to use that name, but they all provide essentially the same program interface.) Unix was created around 1970 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.</p>
                <p>Prior to Unix, almost everyone thought that an operating system had to be developed for a particular computer architecture, and had to be written in the machine language of that computer, the very low-level instructions that the hardware understands directly. The very first version of Unix was also written in the machine language of a particular computer, the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11. But the Unix developers knew that the PDP-11 wasn't the only computer in the world, and better ones would come along eventually, so they wanted to make Unix <em>portable,</em> meaning that it could be brought to a new computer architecture without a complete rewrite.  So in 1972 Dennis Ritchie invented the C programming language for that purpose.  C is similar to other languages available at the time, but with one added feature: a C programmer can read or write any individual byte of the program's memory by knowing its <em>address,</em> a number that distinguishes it from other bytes.  (You can see that this feature is quite the opposite from high level abstraction.  It is useful only to a programmer who's thinking in detail about what's where in the computer's memory.) Unix was then rewritten in C.</p>
                <p>Because of its portability, Unix spread quickly to many computer architectures. Researchers at Berkeley developed a version, based on the AT&amp;T version, with <em>virtual memory,</em> the ability to run a program that's only partly in the computer's main memory, with the rest kept on a disk. This Berkeley version is the direct ancestor of Apple's operating systems, MacOS (since MacOS 10.0) and iOS. (An Apple computer doesn't behave anything like a Unix computer, but the differences are almost all in application-level programs, not in the kernel.) Android, Google's operating system for cell phones and tablets, is based on Linux, a complete rewrite of Unix originally written by Linus Torvalds, who was, at the time, a computer science student in Finland.</p>
