        	<h3>The First Computer</h3>
            <p>Why this?  Really the point is to broaden their sense of what a computer is,
            including the way computer architecture depends on the lower levels of
            abstraction.</p>
            <p>Why here?  Building up to the Analytical Engine on the next page.</p>
            
            <h3>From "The General Purpose Computer" page</h3>
            <p>Why this? This page is making the point that it's <em>programmability</em> that heralds the huge leap to modern computing, and that it was invented 200 years ago, well before it could actually be made practical.</p>
            <p>Why here? Following up on the first-page abstraction diagram, this is focusing in on the hardware/software barrier.</p>

        <h2>The History of Computers</h2>

		<p>When was the first computer built? This is actually a trick question, because the answer depends on where you draw the line between computers and non-computers.</p>
		<p>Here is a timeline that shows some events in the history of computers. Click on the dates to see one example of something that happened at that time. You decide what you think makes sense to call the first "real" computer. </p>

                <p>The <em>abacus</em> was first invented about 4,000 years ago. It is a computing device that can be used to do arithmetic, even including square roots and cube roots, on multi-digit numbers. In some countries, abaci are still widely used today. People who are well-trained to use the abacus can perform calculations remarkably quickly.</p>

                <p><div class="sidenote">example of a device for special-purpose "computation"; edit way back</div>There have been many inventions, over the course of history, of <em>special-purpose</em> computing devices. A typical example is the <em>orrery</em>, a device made to display the positions of the planets in the Solar System. The first known device of this kind was the <em>Antikythera mechanism</em> from about 2100 years ago. It was discovered in 1900, in fragments, in an ancient shipwreck in Greece. At the time it was made, it was generally believed that the sun and the other planets all revolved around the Earth. This made the positions very complicated to work out, so the mechanism was much harder to design and build than it would be today. </p>

                <h4><strong>The Difference Engine</strong> (c. XXXX CE)</h4>
                <p>So, there's no definitive answer to "when was the first computer." Nevertheless, most people point to the work of Charles Babbage (1791-1871) as the real beginning of the computer age.  What was special about Babbage's work?</p>
                <p>Babbage was an expert in several fields, but the one most relevant to our story was his skill at creating mechanisms out of precisely milled metal gears.  He used gears to design a very complex machine that would automatically compute and print tables of numbers, like the tables of log or trig functions you may have in the back of a math textbook.  In Babbage's time, such tables were computed by hand, by human mathematicians, and typeset by hand for printing.  Both the computation and the copying into type were error-prone, and accurate tables were needed for purposes ranging from engineering to navigation.</p>
                <p>Babbage built a first, small Difference Engine in 1822.  This first effort proved that a Difference Engine was possible, but it didn't have the precision (number of digits in each number) to be practical.  In 1823, the British government funded Babbage to build a larger version.  Unfortunately, metalsmiths in his day could not produce very precise gears in large quantities; each one had to be handmade.  So he spent ten times his approved budget by the time the government cancelled the project in 1842.</p>

                <p>In 1991, the London Science Museum completed a Difference Engine following Babbage's original design, using gears made by modern processes but at the level of precision that was available to Babbage.  This proved that in principle Babbage could have completed a working machine, given enough time and money.</p>

                <h4><strong>The Analytical Engine</strong> (c. XXXX CE)</h4>
                <p>The Difference Engine could compute many different functions, by manually setting the starting position of various gears.  But it had only one algorithm, built into the hardware design.  In 1833, Babbage began work on a much more ambitious project, the Analytical Engine.  It was based on the general idea of the Difference Engine, but with a crucial difference:  It could carry out instructions in a primitive programming language, prepared on punched cards.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The Analytical Engine, like modern computers, had an arithmetic processor (called the "mill") and a separate memory (the "store") that would hold 1,000 numbers, each with up to 40 digits.  (In modern terms, this is comparable to 20,000 bytes, since a byte can hold two digits, with four bits needed for each.)  By the way, the mill did arithmetic in decimal (with digits 0 to 9  equally spaced around each gear), so don't think that computers have to use just "ones and zeros."  The programming language included conditionals and looping, which is all you need to represent any algorithm.  (It could loop because it could move forward or backward through the punched cards containing the program.)</p>
                <p>Alas, Babbage could build only a small part of the Analytical Engine, which would have required even more metalworking than the Difference Engine.  His notes about the design weren't complete, and so nobody has built a working model, although there are simulations available on the Web.</p>
                <p>So, almost 200 years ago, Babbage created plans for what is essentially a modern computer, although he didn't have electronics available; his underlying hardware was entirely mechanical.  Users would turn a crank to run the machine; one or more turns of the crank would carry out one instruction in the program.  In the early days of electronic computers, Babbage's work was not widely known, and people ended up reinventing many of his ideas.</p>

            	<h4><strong>The First Programmer</strong> (c. XXXX CE)</h4>
                <p>Although his design was very versatile, Babbage himself was still mainly interested in printing tables of numbers.  It was his collaborator Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace, who first recognized that the numbers in Babbage's computer could be used not only as quantities but also as representing musical notes, text characters, and so on.  Much of what we know today about Babbage's design comes from Ada Lovelace's extensive notes on its design.  Those notes included the first <em>published</em> program for the Analytical Engine, and so she is widely considered "the first programmer," although although it's almost certain that Babbage himself wrote several example programs while designing the machine.</p>
                <p>But, whether or not she was truly the first programmer, historians all agree that she did something much more important: she invented the idea of <em>symbolic</em> computation, as opposed to numeric computation.  This insight paved the way for all the ways that computers are used today, from movies on demand to voice-interactive programs such as Siri and Alexa.</p>

                    What makes a computer usable for more than one purpose is the abstraction of <em>software,</em> in the form of a program stored in the computer's memory.<br />
                    <small>(Babbage's design was not quite the modern form of a stored program architecture, because the program memory was separate from the data memory.  That meant that the computer couldn't produce a program for itself.)</small>

                <li>We didn't get <em>usable</em> computers until there was an underlying technology (the transistor, as we'll see shortly) small enough, inexpensive enough, and fast enough to support the program abstraction.</li>
