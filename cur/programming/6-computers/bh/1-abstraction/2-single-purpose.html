            <p>Why this?  Really the point is to broaden their sense of what a computer is,
            including the way computer architecture depends on the lower levels of
            abstraction.</p>
            <p>Why here?  Building up to the Analytical Engine on the next page.</p>

		<h2>The First Computer</h2>

		<p>When was the first computer built? This is actually a trick question, because the answer depends on where you draw the line between computers and non-computers.</p>
		<p>Here is a timeline that shows some events in the history of computers. Click on the dates to see one example of something that happened at that time. You decide what you think makes sense to call the first "real" computer. </p>

                <p>The <em>abacus</em> was first invented about 4,000 years ago. It is a computing device that can be used to do arithmetic, even including square roots and cube roots, on multi-digit numbers. In some countries, abaci are still widely used today. People who are well-trained to use the abacus can perform calculations remarkably quickly.</p>

                <p><div class="sidenote">example of a device for special-purpose "computation"; edit way back</div>There have been many inventions, over the course of history, of <em>special-purpose</em> computing devices. A typical example is the <em>orrery</em>, a device made to display the positions of the planets in the Solar System. The first known device of this kind was the <em>Antikythera mechanism</em> from about 2100 years ago. It was discovered in 1900, in fragments, in an ancient shipwreck in Greece. At the time it was made, it was generally believed that the sun and the other planets all revolved around the Earth. This made the positions very complicated to work out, so the mechanism was much harder to design and build than it would be today. </p>
