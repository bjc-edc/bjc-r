        	<h3>The First Computer</h3>
            <p>Why this?  Really the point is to broaden their sense of what a computer is,
            including the way computer architecture depends on the lower levels of
            abstraction.</p>
            <p>Why here?  Building up to the Analytical Engine on the next page.</p>
            
            <h3>From "The General Purpose Computer" page</h3>
            <p>Why this? This page is making the point that it's <em>programmability</em> that heralds the huge leap to modern computing, and that it was invented 200 years ago, well before it could actually be made practical.</p>
            <p>Why here? Following up on the first-page abstraction diagram, this is focusing in on the hardware/software barrier.</p>

        <h2>The History of Computers</h2>

		<p>When was the first computer built? That depends on where you draw the line between computers and non-computers.</p>

Decide what <em>you</em> think makes sense to call the first real computer. (And, of course, look up more detail on any of these, if you want.) </p>

                <p>The <em>abacus</em> is a computing device that was  invented about 4,000 years ago. It  can be used to do arithmetic,  including square roots and cube roots, on multi-digit numbers. In some countries, the abacus is still widely used today. People who are well-trained to use it can perform calculations remarkably quickly.</p>

                Since antiquity, many <em>special-purpose</em> computing devices have been invented. For example this <em>orrery</em> displayed the positions of the planets in the Solar System. The first known device of this kind dated from about 2100 years ago. People at that time generally believed that the sun and  other planets all revolved around the Earth, making the positions  very complicated to work out, so the mechanism was much harder to design and build than it would be today.

                <h4><strong>The Difference Engine</strong> (c. XXXX CE)</h4>
                <p>In 1822 Charles Babbage designed  a device he called a &quot;Difference Engine.&quot; It was made out of precisely milled metal gears and would automatically compute and print tables of numbers, like  tables of log or trig functions.  In Babbage's time, such tables were computed by hand, by human mathematicians, and were typeset by hand for printing.  Both the computation and the copying into type were error-prone, and accurate tables were needed for purposes ranging from engineering to navigation.</p>
<p>Babbage built a first, small Difference Engine proving that it could work, but it was too small to have the precision (number of digits in each number) to be practical.  In 1823, the British government funded Babbage to build a larger version.  Unfortunately, metalsmiths in his day could not produce very precise gears in large quantities; each one had to be handmade.  So he spent ten times his approved budget by the time the government cancelled the project in 1842.</p>

                <p>In 1991, the London Science Museum completed a Difference Engine following Babbage's original design, using gears made by modern processes, proving that Babbage could have completed a working machine, if he'd had enough time and money.</p>

                <h4><strong>The Analytical Engine</strong> (c. XXXX CE)</h4>
                <p>The Difference Engine could compute many different functions, by manually setting the starting position of various gears.  But it had only one algorithm, built into the hardware design.  In 1833, Babbage began work on a much more ambitious project, the Analytical Engine.  It was based on the general idea of the Difference Engine, but with a crucial difference:  It could carry out instructions in a primitive programming language, prepared on punched cards.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Like modern computers,  Analytical Engine had an arithmetic processor (called the "mill") and a separate memory (the "store") that would hold 1,000 numbers, each with up to 40 digits.  (In modern terms, this is comparable to 20,000 bytes, since a byte can hold two digits, with four bits needed for each.)  The mill did its arithmetic in decimal, with digits 0 through 9  equally spaced around each gear.  The programming language included conditionals and looping, which is all you need to represent any algorithm.  It could loop because it could move forward or backward through the punched cards containing the program.</p>
                <p>Again, Babbage could build only a small part of the Analytical Engine, which would have required even more metalworking than the Difference Engine.  His notes about the design weren't complete, and so nobody has built a working model, although there are simulations available on the Web.</p>
                <p>So, almost 200 years ago, Babbage created plans for what is essentially a modern computer, though mechanical, not electronic.  Users would turn a crank to run the machine; one or more turns of the crank would carry out one instruction in the program.  In the early days of electronic computers, Babbage's work was not widely known, and people ended up reinventing many of his ideas.</p>
                <p>Babbage's design was also not quite the modern form of a stored program architecture, because the program memory was separate from the data memory.  That meant that the computer couldn't produce a program for itself. Modern computers can not only run programs, but can be programmed to modify and even create their own programs.</p>

            	<h4><strong>The First Programmer</strong> (c. XXXX CE)</h4>
                <p>Babbage's design was very versatile, but he personally was still mainly interested in printing tables of numbers.  It was his collaborator Ada Lovelace, who first recognized that the numbers in Babbage's computer could be used not only as quantities but also as representing musical notes, text characters, and so on.   She is widely considered "the first programmer&quot; because, along with her extensive notes on the Analytical Engine—much of what we know today about its design—she included its first published program.    </p>
                <p>Historians credit her with something even more important: she invented the idea of <em>symbolic</em> computation, as opposed to numeric computation.  This insight paved the way for all the ways that computers are used today, from movies on demand to voice-interactive programs such as Siri and Alexa.</p>
