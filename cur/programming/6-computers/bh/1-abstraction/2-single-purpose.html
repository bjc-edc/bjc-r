        	<h3>The First Computer</h3>
            <p>Why this?  Really the point is to broaden their sense of what a computer is,
            including the way computer architecture depends on the lower levels of
            abstraction.</p>
            <p>Why here?  Building up to the Analytical Engine on the next page.</p>
            
            <h3>From "The General Purpose Computer" page</h3>
            <p>Why this? This page is making the point that it's <em>programmability</em> that heralds the huge leap to modern computing, and that it was invented 200 years ago, well before it could actually be made practical.</p>
            <p>Why here? Following up on the first-page abstraction diagram, this is focusing in on the hardware/software barrier.</p>

        <h2>The History of Computers</h2>

		<p>When was the first computer built? That depends on where you draw the line between computers and non-computers.</p>

                    Since antiquity, many <em>special-purpose</em> computing devices have been invented. For example this <em>orrery</em> displayed the positions of the planets in the Solar System. The first known device of this kind dated from about 2100 years ago. People at that time generally believed that the sun and  other planets all revolved around the Earth, making the positions  very complicated to work out, so the mechanism was much harder to design and build than it would be today.

                <h4><strong>The Difference Engine</strong> (c. 1822 CE)</h4>
                <p>
                	In 1822, Charles Babbage designed a device he called a "Difference Engine." Made  of precisely milled metal gears, it would compute and print tables of numbers, like log or trig functions. Accurate tables were needed for purposes ranging from engineering to navigation, but back then, such tables were computed by hand and hand-typeset for printing and both steps were error-prone.

				<p>
                    Babbage built a model proving that it could work, but his model was too small to have the precision to be practical. In 1823, the British government funded Babbage to build a larger version.  Unfortunately, metalsmiths in his day could not produce very precise gears quickly; each one had to be hand made. So he spent ten times his approved budget by the time the government cancelled the project in 1842.

                <p>Almost 150 years later, the London Science Museum completed a working Difference Engine following Babbage's original design. Babbage could have done it himself if he'd had enough time and money!</p>

                <h4><strong>The Analytical Engine</strong> (c. 1833 CE)</h4>
                <p>
                	The Difference Engine could compute varied functions by manually setting the starting position of various gears.  But it had only one algorithm, built into the hardware design.  In 1833, Babbage began a much more ambitious project, the Analytical Engine.  It was based on the general idea of the Difference Engine, but with a crucial difference:  It could carry out instructions in a primitive programming language, prepared on punched cards.
                    <div class="sidenote">

                </p>
                <p>Like modern computers, Analytical Engine had an arithmetic processor (called the "mill") and a separate memory (the "store") that would seem microscopic by today's standards. The mill did its arithmetic in decimal, with digits 0 through 9  equally spaced around each gear.  The programming language included conditionals and looping,  all you need to represent any algorithm.  It could loop because it could move forward or backward through the punched cards.</p>
                <p>Again, Babbage could build only a small part of the Analytical Engine, which would have required even more metalworking than the Difference Engine.  His design notes  weren't complete, and so nobody has built a working model, although there are simulations available on the Web.</p>
                <p>So, almost 200 years ago, Babbage created plans for what is essentially a modern computer, though mechanical, not electronic.  Users would turn a crank to run the machine; one or more turns of the crank would carry out one instruction in the program.  In the early days of electronic computers, Babbage's work was not widely known, and people ended up reinventing many of his ideas.</p>
                <p>Babbage's design was also not quite the modern form of a stored program architecture, because the program memory was separate from the data memory.  That meant that the computer couldn't produce a program for itself. Modern computers can not only <em>run</em> programs, but can be programmed to <em>modify</em> and even <em>create</em> their own programs.</p>

            	<h4><strong>The First Programmer</strong> (c. 1842 CE)</h4>
                <p>Babbage's design was very versatile, but his interest was still mainly in printing tables of numbers. It was his collaborator Ada Lovelace, who first recognized that the numbers in Babbage's computer could be used not only as quantities but also as representing musical notes, text characters, and so on. She is widely considered "the first programmer" because, along with her extensive notes on the Analytical Engine—much of what we know today about its design—she included its first published program.</p>
                <p>Historians credit her with something even more important: she invented the idea of <em>symbolic</em> computation, as opposed to numeric computation.  This insight paved the way for all the ways that computers are used today, from movies on demand to voice-interactive programs such as Siri and Alexa.</p>

                <li><strong>Sketchpad</strong>:  Ivan Sutherland's 1963 Ph.D. thesis project, a program to help in
                drawing blueprints; in his demo he draws a rivet prototype (out of line
                segments and arcs of circles -- it just occurs to me that this is where the
                name of Geometer's Sketchpad came from!) and then puts a rivet into an
                assembly, and then modifies the prototype and shows how the change propagates
                to each individual rivet.  So, it pioneered the ability to draw on a screen
                (using a light pen; the mouse hasn't been invented yet); it pioneered object
                oriented programming.</li>
                
                <li><strong>NLS</strong>:  Douglas Engelbart had a lifelong interest in using technology to augment
                human intelligence, and in particular to facilitate collaboration among people
                physically distant.  The name comes from "oN-Line System" because he also had
                an "oFf-Line System" that's no longer important.  He studied people doing
                intellectual work and noted that when they're not using a computer they don't
                sit rigidly in front of their desks; they wheel their chairs around the room as
                they grab books or Cokes or whatever, or just spread out their legs.  So he
                designed an office chair attachment of a lapboard containing a keyboard and a
                mouse -- the first mouse, with three buttons.  (Also a "chord keyboard" with
                five piano-key-like buttons so that you could position small amounts of text
                without having to move your hands back and forth between keyboard and mouse.)
                Different people could collaborate on the same page at the same time, seeing
                each others' mouse cursors.  Documents created in the system had hyperlinks to
                other documents, long before the Web used this idea.  There were lots of
                smaller firsts, too, such as a picture-in-picture display of the other person's
                face camera, long before Skype.
                
                (I know that isn't two sentences, but it's really impossible to overstate how
                much Engelbart changed the world.  People mostly know his name because of the
                mouse, but the core of the modern windowed GUI was in NLS.)</li>
                
                <li>* <strong>analog computer</strong>
                
                Right around 1900 there were analog computers (with precursors long ago, see
                the Wikipedia article), in which a wire wasn't either fully on or fully off,
                but could carry any voltage (continuously variable) in the machine's operating
                range.  Because all voltages were legal, these machines suffered from
                electronic noise (see my page about transistors) and so their precision was
                limited, typically to two or three decimal digits.  But for a certain class of
                problems (namely solving differential equations) these machines were a very
                natural fit.  They were programmed with plugboards, like ENIAC.</li>
                
                <li>* <strong>Hollerith's punch card tabulator for the Census</strong>
                
                Before the programmable digital computer, the first "big data" application was
                the US Census, for which Herman Hollerith developed a system of storing
                information encoded by punching holes in cardboard cards.  (Redundant, I
                guess.)  These cards were processed by non-programmable "tabulating equipment,"
                such as a card sorter, that could take a deck of cards and arrange them in
                numeric order based on a subset of the columns.  (Note that Hollerith did /not/
                invent the idea of the punched card; Babbage used them in the Analytical
                Engine.)  His technology was bought by IBM and was the beginning of their
                involvement in computation.</li>
                
                <li>* <strong>networked instant messaging</strong> (K. Harrenstein and B. Harvey)  :-)
                
                What we didn't invent was a centralized database of who's logged in on what
                computer; you had to know that the person you want to send a message to is at
                MIT, or is at Stanford.  (I'm not sure anyone else actually implemented this,
                although it was registered as an official Arpanet protocol, meaning just that
                we announced it in that RFC.)</li>

                There is text about this in the <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/4-unsolvable-undecidable/2-halting-problem.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">unsolvable problem lab in U5</a>.</li>

                <li><strong>first personal computers</strong> (1980ish),
                
                Earlier than that, I think.  The Mac was (unforgettably) 1984, and the Apple II
                was several years before that, and the Altair was even earlier.
                
                I think it's worth saying that the idea of interactive computing is way older
                than that wave of small machines.  Back when computers were big and expensive,
                there were interactive terminals connected to timesharing systems, starting no
                later than CTSS in 1961.  The deep idea here is that pioneers develop ideas
                that are a little beyond the capabilities of the underlying technology, just as
                Logo was developed on a timesharing system but with the understanding that kids
                would eventually be able to run it on a personal computer.</li>
