Why this?  Really the point is to broaden their sense of what a computer is,
including the way computer architecture depends on the lower levels of
abstraction.

<p>Why here?  Building up to the Analytical Engine on the next page.</p>

<h2>The First Computer</h2>

<p>When was the first computer built?</p>

<p>This is actually a trick question, because the answer depends on where you
draw the line between computers and non-computers.</p>

<p>20,000 years ago people cut patterns of notches into animal bones.  Some
experts believe that these <em>tally sticks</em> were used to perform
arithmetic computations.</p>

<p>The <em>abacus</em> was first invented about 4,000 years ago.  It is a
computing device that can be used to do arithmetic, even including square
roots and cube roots, on multi-digit numbers.  In some countries, abaci are
still widely used today.  People who are well-trained to use the abacus can
perform calculations remarkably quickly, given that human fingers have to move
the stones that represent each digit.  But you may not want to call this a
"computer," since it's still a human brain directing the operation of the
machine.</p>

<p>There have been many inventions, over the course of history, of
<em>special-purpose</em> computing devices.  A typical example is the
<em>orrery</em>, a device made to display the positions of the planets in the
Solar System.  The first known device of this kind was the <em>Antikythera
mechanism</em> from about 2100 years ago.  It was discovered in 1900, in
fragments, in an ancient shipwreck in Greece.  At the time it was made, it was
generally believed that the sun and the other planets all revolved around the
Earth.  This made the positions very complicated to work out, so the mechanism
was much harder to design and build than it would be today.  (The sun-centered
understanding of the Solar System was introduced to European science by
Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543.  The first sun-centered orrery was made in about
1704.)</p>

<p>These mechanisms were a kind of computer, but they weren't
<em>programmable.</em> They could only do one particular computation that was
built into their mechanism.</p>
