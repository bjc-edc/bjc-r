        <div class="todo">
            <p>Why this?  This page is about the four levels of abstraction between the program abstraction and the digital abstraction, from the chart on page 1.</p>
            <p>Why here?  There will be three pages, including this one, about the parts of the abstraction hierarchy separated by the two major abstraction barriers, going from top to bottom.</p>
            <p>
                2.2.3F A logic gate is a hardware abstraction that is modeled by a Boolean function.<br />
                2.2.3G A chip is an abstraction composed of low level components and circuits that perform a specific function<br />
                5.2.1F Processes use memory, a central processing unit (CPU), and input and output.

        <h2>The Digital Domain: Architecture</h2>
        <p>Underneath the layer that <em>users</em> see—the results of software like word processors, photo editors, video games, and other apps—are the tools and structures that the programmers depend on as they build the applications. This  layer of abstraction comes between thinking about programs and thinking about electronics. This &quot;digital abstraction&quot; includes the architecture, components, chips, and logic gates—roughly speaking, the computer hardware.</p>
        
    <h3>What's an Architecture?</h3>
        <p>The processor in the computer you are using understands only one language, its own <em>machine language</em>. Not Java, C, Snap<em>!</em>, Python, or anything else. To be run by your machine, programs written in those other programming languages must first be translated into machine language. The designers of a programming language must somehow include that translation. Languages like Snap<em>!</em> that run in a browser let the browser handle part of that translation. Other languages come in different versions depending on the machine and operating system.</p>

        <p>What's an architecture? It's an abstraction that specifies the machine language, instructions that the hardware will understand. It also tells how the processor connects to the memory. It doesn't include actual circuitry; that comes at a lower level of abstraction. </p>
        <p>One important part of an architecture is the number of wires that connect the processor and  memory. This is called the <em>width</em> of the architecture, measured in <em>bits.</em> The width is the number of data bits that the computer  processes in one instruction.</p>

          <div id="hint-architecture" class="collapse">Most computer processors (the part that carries out instructions) in desktop or laptop computers use an architecture designed at Intel, a chip manufacturer, called "x86." The first processor using that architecture was called the 8086, released in 1978. Since then, there have been many refinements of the architecture, but they're almost always <em>backward compatible,</em> meaning that a program written for the 8086 will still run on today's versions of x86. The original 8086 was a 16-bit architecture; since then 32-bit (since 1985) and 64-bit (since 2003) versions have been developed.</div>

          <div id="hint-architecture-general" class="collapse"><h4>The memory hierarchy</h4>
        <p>For a given cost of circuit hardware, <strong>the bigger the memory, the slower it works.</strong> For this reason, computers don't just have one big chunk of memory. There will be a small number of <em>registers</em> inside the processor itself, usually between 8 and 16 of them. The size of a data register is  equal to the width of the architecture.</p>
        <p>The computer's main memory, these days, is measured in GB (gigabytes, or billions of bytes). A memory of that size can't be fast enough to keep up with a modern processor. Luckily, computer programs generally have <em>locality of reference,</em> which means that if the program has just made use of a particular memory location, it's probably going to use a nearby location next. So a complete program may be very big, but over the course of a second or so only a small part of it will be needed. Therefore,  modern computers are designed with one or more <em>cache</em> memories—much smaller  and therefore faster—between the processor and the main memory. The processor makes sure that the most recently used memory is copied into the cache. </p>
        <p>One recent 64-bit x86 processor has a first level (L1) cache of 64KB (thousands of bytes) inside the processor chip, a larger but slower L2 cache of 256 KB, also inside the processor, and an L3 cache of up to 2 MB (megabytes, millions of bytes) outside the processor. Each level of cache has a copy of the most recently used parts of the next level outward: the L1 cache copies part of the L2 cache, which copies part of the L3 cache, which copies part of the main memory. Data in the L1 cache can be accessed by the processor about as fast as its internal registers, and each level outward is a little slower.</p>
        
        <h4>Second sourcing</h4>
        <p>Intel licenses other chip manufacturers to build processors that use the same architecture as Intel's processors. Why do they do that? Wouldn't they make more money if people had to buy from Intel? The reason is that computer manufacturers, such as Dell, Apple, and Lenovo, won't build their systems around an architecture that is only available from one company. They're not worried that Intel will go out of business; the worry is that there may be a larger-than-expected demand for a particular processor, and Intel may not be able to fill orders on time. But if that processor is also available from other companies such as AMD and Cyrix, then a delay at Intel won't turn into a delay at Dell. Those other chip manufacturers may not use the same circuitry as the Intel version, as long as they behave the same at the architecture level.</p>
