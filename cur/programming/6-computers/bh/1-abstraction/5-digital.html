    <div class="todo">
Why this?  This page is about the four levels of abstraction between the program abstraction and the digital abstraction, from the chart on page 1.
<p>Why here?  There will be three pages, including this one, about the parts of the abstraction hierarchy separated by the two major abstraction barriers, going from top to bottom.</p>

<H2>The Digital Domain</H2>

<p>We now move to the levels of abstraction between the program abstraction and the digital abstraction: architecture, components, chips, and logic gates.</p>
