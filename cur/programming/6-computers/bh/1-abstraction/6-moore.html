    <h2>Moore's Law</h2>

    <p>Gordon Moore is one of the pioneers of integrated circuits, one of the founders of Intel and of Fairchild Semiconductor. In 1965 he predicted that the number of transistors that could be fit on one chip would double every year. (In 1975, seeing a slight slowdown in chip capacity, he revised his estimate to doubling every two years.) This prediction is known as <em>Moore's Law.</em></p>
    <p>As an Electrical Engineer, Moore's interest and expertise is in chip manufacturing, and that's why he was most interested in predicting component density (how many transistors per chip). But it turns out that other important measurements have also shown the same doubling behavior, such as processor speed and the amount of memory that fits in a computer.</p>

<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol>
  <li>That huge computer you saw in Lab 1 was built in 1975, and it had about 1MB of memory. My cell phone was built in 2017 and it has about 64GB of memory. Does Moore's law hold for these two machines?
  <ol type="a">
    <li>How many years apart were they made?</li>
    <li>If memory capacity doubled every two years during that time, by about what number should you multiply the PDP-10's 1MB to predict the size of memory in 2017?</li>
    <li>Is 64GB more than or less than you'd expect?</li>
  </ol>
  </li></ol></div>
 
<h3>Limitations to Moore's Law</h3>
<p>For transistor counts to keep growing, the size of a transistor must keep getting smaller. Some time in the next decade, the size of a transistor will approach the size of an atom. At that scale, transistors won't work for various reasons. This is a fundamental limit to the density of transistors on a chip.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are fundamental limitations that affect the speed of a processor. such as the speed of electrons through a wire.</p>
<p>Moore's Law optimists argue that technologies other than transistors will become usable before manufacturers hit a fundamental limit. One such approach would involve using an individual electron to represent one bit. Electrons are smaller than atoms, so this technology, if it works, will allow further dramatic increases in density. Another approach would use light beams rather than electric current to hold bits.</p>
<p>But these developments are still far away. Meanwhile, chip density and processor speed have run up against a less fundamental, but really important, limit: Denser chips and faster signal processing both generate increased heat. Current technology is right at the edge of generating enough heat to melt the chips, destroying the computer. This is why processor chips are surrounded by metal <em>heat sinks,</em> which conduct heat away from the chip and into the air.</p>
<p>Because of the heat problem, chip manufacturers have, at least temporarily, given up on making processors faster. Instead, they are putting more than one processor on a chip. If a computation can carry out the same algorithm on different parts of the data in parallel, sort of like sprite clones all running the same script at the same time, then these <em>multicore</em> chips can have an effective speed greater than the speed of a single processor. A computer you buy today is likely to have two or four processors on one chip. But using multicore efficiently requires that the software be written with multicore in mind.</p>
