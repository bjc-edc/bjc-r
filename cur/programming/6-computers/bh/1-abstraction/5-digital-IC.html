		<title>Unit 6 Lab 1: Computer Abstraction Hierarchy, Page 5</title>

        <div class="todo">
            <p>Why this?  This page is about the four levels of abstraction between the program abstraction and the digital abstraction, from the chart on page 1.</p>
            <p>Why here?  There will be three pages, including this one, about the parts of the abstraction hierarchy separated by the two major abstraction barriers, going from top to bottom.</p>
            <p>
                2.2.3F A logic gate is a hardware abstraction that is modeled by a Boolean function.<br />
                2.2.3G A chip is an abstraction composed of low level components and circuits that perform a specific function<br />
                5.2.1F Processes use memory, a central processing unit (CPU), and input and output.

        <h2>The Digital Domain: Integrated Circuits</h2>
        
        <p>The fundamental enabling technology for the computer age was the <em>transistor.</em> A transistor is an amplifier: A small change in its input causes a bigger change in its output. But in computer circuits, transistors are used as remote-control switches: The input either does or doesn't have voltage coming in, and the output does the same, but at higher power, similar to the way a light switch on the wall can control a high-power light bulb in the ceiling. We'll revisit how transistors function on the next page.</p>
        <p>The transistor was invented in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Laboratories, also the home of Unix.  The inventors were awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.</p>
        <p>
            At first, each transistor was in a separate plastic package. Here's a picture of a circuit made with discrete (separate) transistors:<br />

        <p>In this picture, the transistors are the black, D-shaped parts. The brown more-or-less cylindrical parts are <em>resistors,</em> a much simpler component that has been around about as long as electricity. The dark lines you can see through the circuit board are wires, printed onto the board. If your classroom printer had liquid silver ink, it could make circuit boards like this. All the components (transistors and resistors) are on the front of the board. The wires from these components (one at each end of a resistor, three close together on the flat side of a transistor) go through the board, where they are soldered (a kind of hot metallic glue) to the circuit board's wiring. A few wires are on the front side of the board, because otherwise the circuit couldn't be made without printed wires crossing each other.</p>
        <p>The IBM 7090, developed in 1959, was built out of discrete transistors â€” over 50,000 of them. As you can imagine, this machine was large and expensive: about three million dollars, equivalent to over $55 million today. In those days, almost everyone thought that computers would be used only by large corporations or governments.</p>
        <p>In order to have the modern computer age, in which many people carry extremely powerful computers in their pockets (their cell phones), circuits had to become much smaller and cheaper. The way this happened was through the invention of the <em>integrated circuit </em>("IC" or "chip"). There wasn't a single definitive invention; the first relevant work was done in 1949, and techniques to fit components more closely in a chip are still being developed. But the Nobel Prize went to Jack Kilby, in 2000, for his 1958 demonstration of a working IC.</p>
        <p>Early ICs could include only a few transistors. The circuit in the photo above could just about fit in one IC in the early 1960s, but progress was quick, and the first one-chip computer processor, the Intel 4004, was designed in 1969-1970. It had about 2300 transistors, and took up well under one square inch. It was called the "4004" because it had a four-bit bus architecture, so it wasn't very powerful as computers go. But progress was quick; the eight-bit Intel 8008, with 3500 transistors on the chip, came out in 1972. The Intel 8086, their first 16-bit-wide microprocessor, came out in 1978 and had about 20,000 transistors.  A variant version called the 8088 was used in the first IBM PC. The Motorola 68000, with 40,000 transistors, came out in 1979, and was used in several manufacturers' Unix workstations and in the early versions of the Apple Macintosh.</p>
        <p>The largest processor chip in 2017, the AMC Epyc, has more than <em>19 billion</em> transistors!</p>
