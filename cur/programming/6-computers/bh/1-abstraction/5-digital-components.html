        <div class="todo">
            <p>Why this?  This page is about the four levels of abstraction between the program abstraction and the digital abstraction, from the chart on page 1.</p>
            <p>Why here?  There will be three pages, including this one, about the parts of the abstraction hierarchy separated by the two major abstraction barriers, going from top to bottom.</p>
            <p>
                2.2.3F A logic gate is a hardware abstraction that is modeled by a Boolean function.<br />
                2.2.3G A chip is an abstraction composed of low level components and circuits that perform a specific function<br />
                5.2.1F Processes use memory, a central processing unit (CPU), and input and output.

        <h2>Components</h2>
<p>For as long as people have been teaching other people about computers, one thing they always say is "A computer consists of the processor, memory, and input/output devices." </p>
        <p>
            In the early days of computers, it was easy to point out the huge racks of equipment that contained each of those three components:<br />

            <img class="inline" width="360px" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/pdp-10-disks.jpg" alt="PDP-10 I/O">
        </p>
        
        <p>These are pictures of the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 computer, from the 1970s. Each of the big racks full of circuitry is about the size of a refrigerator.  Today, a much more powerful computer fits inside a cell phone.</p>
        <p>Today's processors and memory are so small that the only things we see are the external parts, but processor and memory are still most important things to understand in an architecture. But the visible parts of a computer are also important.</p>

                        Tips: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/my-name.png" alt="my (name)" title="my (name)" /> to access the name of a sprite. Find <code>my&nbsp;(</code><var>neighbors</var><code>)</code> in the Sensing menu, and change the drop-down menu to <var>name</var>.</li>

                            <li>To copy a script to another sprite, drag the script onto the image of the sprite in the Sprite Corral below the stage. To save time while you are debugging, <strong>use abstraction</strong>: have each sprite use the same custom command block (example at right). That way, you only have to edit the sprites' script once for each change you make.</li>
                            <li>Unless the component list is reduced every time a component is guessed correctly, it will take a long time before all 14 components have been found. To avoid this, every time an item is guessed correctly, it should be removed from the list.</li>

for a computer for one of these four reasons:<br />
	<ol start="a">
     <li>  Mainly to visit web pages that aren't full of movies, such as newspapers
         and online stores, and to read email.</li>

You each want a computer that'll do a great job, spending as little money as
possible.  Research what features of the computer are most important for your
purpose, choose a computer, and compare notes with the rest of your group.
Which computer is most expensive?  Least expensive?  Did you choose a laptop or
a desktop, and why?</li>
