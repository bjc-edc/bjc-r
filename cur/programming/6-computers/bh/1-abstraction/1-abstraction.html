<div class="todo">
Why this?  AP talks about the abstraction hierarchy.  This page shows some
level of detail, but also highlights the two crucial abstraction barriers:
between hardware and software, and between the analog domain and the digital
domain.

<p>Why here?  This page is sort of preview of coming attractions.  It's a short
page, with nothing really to do except read it and move on to the full story.</p>
<p>2.2.3D In an abstraction hierarchy, higher levels of abstraction (the most general concepts) are placed toward the top; lower level abstractions (the more specific concepts) toward the bottom.<br />2.2.3E Binary data is processed by physical layers of computing hardware, including gates, chips, and components.<br />
2.2.3H A hardware component can be low level like a transistor or high level like a video card.<br />
  2.2.3I Hardware is built using multiple levels of abstractions, such as transistors, logic gates, chips, memory, motherboards, special purposes cards, and storage devices.<br />
  2.2.3J Applications and systems are designed, developed, and analyzed using levels of hardware, software, and conceptual abstractions.</p>

<h2>Abstraction Inside the Computer</h2>

<p>In Unit 4, you saw that the Internet software in a computer is arranged in
several levels of abstraction, with application programs (like your email program) at the highest level
and transport protocols such as WiFi and Ethernet at the lowest level. Recall that <em>higher</em> levels of abstraction are closer to what users <em>want</em> to be thinking about; lower levels are closer to the way machines work.</p>

<p>What's going on inside a computer also has levels of abstraction. </p>
<p>At the highest level are programs: some people write them, some people just use them. For the most part, neither the programmer nor the user thinks at all about how the wires, glass, and plastic—the hardware—inside a smartphone or computer actually fit together or work. Programming and programs are an &quot;abstraction&quot;—a way of thinking that ignores details that are, for current purposes, irrelevant and distracting. </p>
<p>Similarly, in a car, knowing that the brake pedal slows the car down is a high level of abstraction; as long as the engineers and mechanics  designed and built the car  right, you don't need to know  <em>how</em> the brake pedal causes wheels to slow down.  </p>
<p>Programs start out as ideas in your head; a <em>programming language</em> lets you express those ideas in a form that can be carried out by a computer. The programming language—<em>any</em> programming language—provides   basic parts with built-in behaviors that you, the programmer, just assemble in order to accomplish your purpose. In Snap<em>!</em>, these  are parts like  <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if.png"  alt="the if-block" title="the if-block">, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat-empty.png" alt="the repeat block" title="the repeat block">, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/equals.png" alt="the equals block" title="the equals block">, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/and.png" alt="the and block" title="the and block">, and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-left.png" height="38" alt="the turn counterclockwise block" title="the turn counterclockwise block">. Often, you assemble those very basic parts into bigger parts that <em>your</em> program will need, like <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/greet-player.png" height="36" alt="greet player block"  title="greet player block" />, and then you think in terms of these even higher levels of abstraction.</p>
<p>Below the programming level is hardware, the guts of the computer and its "architecture," the way it is designed. The hardware's job is to execute whatever programs it gets. But even computer architects are (mostly) thinking just about how to make best use of parts (memory, chips, logic gates, etc.) that already have some useful built in behaviors. And they, too, often assemble these into slightly fancier components that they will need. These designers don't (mostly) have to think about the physics of electrons or photons.</p>
<p>At the lowest level, computer scientists, mathematicians, and physicists who are inventing completely new ways to design faster, smaller computers do need to pay attention to the basic physics that determines how the hardware components work. </p>
<p>Roughly, the abstraction levels might look like this:</p> 

<table frame="border" border="4" cellspacing="20" cellpadding="20">
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application program&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;software</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;operating system&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;software</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="black">------------------</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROGRAM ABSTRACTION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stored-program architecture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;architecture</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;component level: processor, memory, input/output&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hardware/architecture</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integrated circuits (chips)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hardware/architecture</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;logic gates&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hardware</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="black"></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIGITAL ABSTRACTION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transistors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a most basic component</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quantum physics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mathematics</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Different people might draw this diagram slightly differently, so don't try to
memorize all the levels.  The  key abstraction levels to remember are programming, computer hardware, and underlying physics.</p>


<p>The rest of this unit fills in some useful details about the levels of abstraction 
in a computer system.</p>
