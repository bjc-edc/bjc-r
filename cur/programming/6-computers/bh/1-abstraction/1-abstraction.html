Why this?  AP talks about the abstraction hierarchy.  This page shows some
level of detail, but also highlights the two crucial abstraction barriers:
between hardware and software, and between the analog domain and the digital
domain.

Why here?  This page is sort of preview of coming attractions.  It's a short
page, with nothing really to do except read it and move on to the full story.

In Unit 4, you saw that the Internet software in a computer is arranged in
several levels of abstraction, with application programs at the highest level
and transport protocols such as WiFi and Ethernet at the lowest level.

What's going on inside a computer also has levels of abstraction:

application program
operating system
================================== program abstraction
stored-program architecture
component level: processor, memory, input/output
integrated circuits (chips)
logic gates
================================== digital abstraction
transistors
quantum physics

Different people might draw this diagram slightly differently, so don't try to
memorize all the levels.  But there are two key abstraction barriers
highlighted in the diagram, and it's important for you to understand those.

You already understand the program abstraction.  Above this level of
abstraction we're dealing with programs, which you've been writing all year.
Programs start out as ideas in your head; a <em>programming language</em> lets
you express them in a form that can be carried out by a computer.  Below this
level of abstraction we're dealing with hardware, stuff you can touch.  The
two categories, software and hardware, may seem so different that there's
nothing to say about how they're related.  But very shortly you'll learn about
the <em>stored program architecture</em> that connects the two.

The digital abstraction is equally important.  Above this level are the zeros
and ones that people always talk about as "the way computers work."  As we'll
see, the real physical situation inside a computer circuit is more
complicated, and circuit designers work hard to ensure that the simple on/off
model of a computer circuit works well enough to allow error-free computation.

In the rest of this unit, you'll explore the levels of abstraction operating
in a computer system.
