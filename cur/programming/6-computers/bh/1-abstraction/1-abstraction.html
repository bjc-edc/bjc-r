        <h2>Abstraction Inside the Computer</h2>
		<div class="todo">
            <p><strong>Why this?</strong>  AP talks about the abstraction hierarchy.  This page shows some level of detail, but also highlights the two crucial abstraction barriers: between hardware and software, and between the analog domain and the digital domain.</p>
            <p><strong>Why here?</strong>  This page is sort of preview of coming attractions.  It's a short
            page, with nothing really to do except read it and move on to the full story.</p>
            <p>
                2.2.3D In an abstraction hierarchy, higher levels of abstraction (the most general concepts) are placed toward the top; lower level abstractions (the more specific concepts) toward the bottom.<br />2.2.3E Binary data is processed by physical layers of computing hardware, including gates, chips, and components.<br />
                2.2.3H A hardware component can be low level like a transistor or high level like a video card.<br />
                2.2.3I Hardware is built using multiple levels of abstractions, such as transistors, logic gates, chips, memory, motherboards, special purposes cards, and storage devices.<br />
                2.2.3J Applications and systems are designed, developed, and analyzed using levels of hardware, software, and conceptual abstractions.

            <p>"transport protocols such as WiFi and Ethernet at the lowest level" is not how we discussed it in U4. If I understand correctly, we had WiFi and Ethernet at the Link layer, and Transport was much closer to the top. I'm guessing this is just about looseness in language, but we should make the two pages appear more consistent for clarity of the ideas. For now, what's the right thing for <em>this</em> page? --MF, 11/6/17</p>

          <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will learn about the levels of abstraction in computer software and hardware.</p>

		<p>In Unit 4 <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/3-open-protocols.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">A Hierarchy of Open Protocols
</a>, you saw that the Internet software in a computer is arranged in several levels of abstraction, with application programs (like your email program) at the highest level and transport protocols such as WiFi and Ethernet at the lowest level. Recall that <em>higher</em> levels of are closer to what users want to be thinking about; lower levels are closer to the way machines work.</p>
        <p>Like the Internet, the way a computer works on the inside also has levels of abstraction.</p>
		
        
        <p>Roughly, the three levels of abstraction look like this:</p>
		<div class="todo">
        	I moved this graphic up because I think its more effective to <em>see</em> what we are talking about first thing. Brian wants the layers to mirror the lab pages, and I agree with the sentiment. I will revisit this graphic in discussion with him once I've worked through the rest of the lab. Also, the image needs a better (read: more or less word-for-word") alt/title description for ADA (todo after image is finalized). --MF, 11/6/17

        <h3>Software Domain</h3>
        <p>At the highest level are application programs&mdash;the computer software. For the most part, neither the programmer nor the user thinks at all about how the hardware inside a smartphone or computer (the wires, glass, and plastic) actually fit together or work. Using software is an <em>abstraction</em>&mdash;a way of thinking about the computer without thinking about how it works.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Similarly, a driver is thinking at a high level of abstraction when using the brake pedal. As long as the engineers and mechanics  designed and built the car  right, drivers don't need to know all the details about <em>how</em> the brake system works&mdash;they just use it at a high level.</div>

        <h3>Digital Domain</h3>
        <div class="todo">Do we really need the word, "architecture" here? I commented it out, and I think it reads better like this. --MF, 11/6/17</div>
        <p>Below the software is the hardware (the guts of the computer)<!-- and its <em>architecture</em> (the design that specifies how those basic hardware components  fit together to do their job)-->. The hardware's job is to run whatever programs the user requests. For hardware engineers, the <!--high level of--> abstraction focuses on how to make best use of components (memory, chips, logic gates, etc.) that already have some useful built in behaviors, and often also assembling these into slightly fancier components. Engineers mostly don't have to think about how these digital components work inside&mdash;they just think of circuits being either <em>on</em> or <em>off</em> (<em>1</em> or <em>0</em>), with no in-between values. </p>
        
        <h3>Analog Domain</h3>
		<p><!--We call  digital an abstraction because a-->At the lowest level, "noise" in the electronic circuits means that there <em>are</em> in-between values (like "on a little bit"). Electrical engineers must think about  the laws of electronics (physics) to design circuits so that these in-between values stay close enough to 0 or 1 to be treated as if they really <em>are</em> 0 or 1.</p>

		  <div class="todo">This feels a little lame, but I am wanting something to codify here. I left this open ended (as to whether to have it be on paper or out loud) so that the teacher can decide. If we keep this, we can explain that in the TG. Thoughts? ST might have a quizlet too... --MF, 11/6/17</div>
