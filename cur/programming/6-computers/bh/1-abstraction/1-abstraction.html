<div class="todo">
Why this?  AP talks about the abstraction hierarchy.  This page shows some
level of detail, but also highlights the two crucial abstraction barriers:
between hardware and software, and between the analog domain and the digital
domain.

<p>Why here?  This page is sort of preview of coming attractions.  It's a short
page, with nothing really to do except read it and move on to the full story.</p>
<p>2.2.3D In an abstraction hierarchy, higher levels of abstraction (the most general concepts) are placed toward the top; lower level abstractions (the more specific concepts) toward the bottom.<br />2.2.3E Binary data is processed by physical layers of computing hardware, including gates, chips, and components.<br />
2.2.3H A hardware component can be low level like a transistor or high level like a video card.<br />
  2.2.3I Hardware is built using multiple levels of abstractions, such as transistors, logic gates, chips, memory, motherboards, special purposes cards, and storage devices.<br />
  2.2.3J Applications and systems are designed, developed, and analyzed using levels of hardware, software, and conceptual abstractions.</p>

<h2>Abstraction Inside the Computer</h2>

<p>In Unit 4, you saw that the Internet software in a computer is arranged in
several levels of abstraction, with application programs (like your email program) at the highest level
and transport protocols such as WiFi and Ethernet at the lowest level. Recall that <em>higher</em> levels of abstraction are closer to what users <em>want</em> to be thinking about; lower levels are closer to the way machines work.</p>

<p>The way a computer works on the inside also has levels of abstraction. In this lab, you will learn about these levels.</p>
<p><strong>Software domain. </strong>At the highest level are programs: some people write them, some people just use them. For the most part, neither the programmer nor the user thinks at all about how the wires, glass, and plastic—the hardware—inside a smartphone or computer actually fit together or work. This is an <em>abstraction</em>—a way of thinking that takes the computer itself for granted  without thinking about how it works. </p>
<p>Similarly, a driver  is thinking at a high level of abstraction when using the brake pedal. As long as the engineers and mechanics  designed and built the car  right, drivers don't need to know  <em>how</em> the brake system works. </p>

<p><strong>Digital domain. </strong>Below the programming level is hardware (the guts of the computer) and its <em>architecture</em> (the design that specifies how those basic hardware components  fit together to do their job). The hardware's job is to execute whatever programs it gets. For hardware engineers, the high level of abstraction focuses on how to make best use of components (memory, chips, logic gates, etc.) that already have some useful built in behaviors. And they, too, often assemble these into slightly fancier components that they will need. These designers don't (mostly) have to think about how these digital components work inside. At this level, designers think of circuits being either <em>on</em> or <em>off</em>, <em>1</em> or <em>0</em>, with no in-between values. </p>
<p><strong>Analog domain. </strong>We call  digital an abstraction because at the lowest level,   &quot;noise&quot; in the electronic circuits means that there <em>are</em> in-between values. Electrical engineers must think about  the laws of electronics (physics) to design circuits so that these in-between values stay close enough to 0 or 1 to be treated as if they really <em>are</em> 0 or 1.</p>
<p>Roughly, the abstraction levels  look like this:</p>

<p>Different people might draw this diagram slightly differently, so don't try to
memorize all the levels.  The  key abstraction levels to remember are software, digital computer hardware, and underlying analog circuit components.</p>


<p>The rest of this unit fills in some useful details about the levels of abstraction 
in a computer system.</p>
