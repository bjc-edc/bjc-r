        <h2>Abstraction Inside the Computer</h2>
		<div class="todo">
            <p><strong>Why this?</strong>  AP talks about the abstraction hierarchy.  This page shows some level of detail, but also highlights the two crucial abstraction barriers: between hardware and software, and between the analog domain and the digital domain.</p>
            <p><strong>Why here?</strong>  This page is sort of preview of coming attractions.  It's a short
            page, with nothing really to do except read it and move on to the full story.</p>
            <p>
                2.2.3D In an abstraction hierarchy, higher levels of abstraction (the most general concepts) are placed toward the top; lower level abstractions (the more specific concepts) toward the bottom.<br />2.2.3E Binary data is processed by physical layers of computing hardware, including gates, chips, and components.<br />
                2.2.3H A hardware component can be low level like a transistor or high level like a video card.<br />
                2.2.3I Hardware is built using multiple levels of abstractions, such as transistors, logic gates, chips, memory, motherboards, special purposes cards, and storage devices.<br />
                2.2.3J Applications and systems are designed, developed, and analyzed using levels of hardware, software, and conceptual abstractions.

        <p>In Unit 4 <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/3-open-protocols.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">A Hierarchy of Open Protocols
</a>, you saw that the Internet software is arranged in several levels of abstraction, with application programs (like your email program) at the highest level and network hardware protocols such as WiFi and Ethernet at the lowest level. Recall that <em>higher</em> levels of are closer to what users want to be thinking about; lower levels are closer to the way machines work.</p>
        <p>Like the Internet, the way a computer works on the inside also has levels of abstraction.</p>

          <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will learn about the levels of abstraction in computer software and hardware.</p>
          <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn get an overview of three groups (<em>domains</em>) of levels of abstraction.</p>
        </div>

        <p>There are a lot of level of abstraction in how computers work. Here they are organized into three overarching domains:</p>

        	Brian wants the layers to mirror the lab pages, and I agree with the sentiment. I will revisit this graphic in discussion with him once I've worked through the rest of the lab. Also, the image needs a better (read: more or less word-for-word") alt/title description for ADA (todo after image is finalized). --MF, 11/6/17

        <h3>Software Domain</h3>
        <p>The programs you write and use are software, but underneath these programs is more software that helps them work. In this lab, we'll look at four layers of abstraction in the software domain: <strong>applications</strong> that you write and use, <strong>programing languages</strong> that are used to write them, <strong>libraries</strong> of useful functions that hide messy details, and <strong>operating systems</strong> that interface with the hardware.</p>
        <p>Software is an <em>abstraction</em>&mdash;a way of thinking about the computer without thinking about how it works.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Similarly, a driver is thinking at a high level of abstraction when using the brake pedal. As long as the engineers and mechanics designed and built the car right, drivers don't need to know all the details about <em>how</em> the brake system works&mdash;they just use it at a high level.</div>

        <h3>Digital Domain</h3>
        <div class="todo">Brian and I have not been about to reach mutual understanding here. To be fixed!!! --MF, 11/7/17</div>
		<p>The circuitry inside a computer is complicated, and to make building it possible, engineers think about it at several different levels of abstraction: <strong>architecture</strong> (the instructions that software can send that the hardware will understand), <strong>components</strong> (such as memory and ) that implements the architecture, those components are built out of <strong>integrated circuits (chips)</strong>, which are the back rectangles you can see on this circuit board, those ICs are designed around fundamental building blocks that implement Boolean functions (<strong>logic gates</strong>).</p>
        <p>Engineers mostly don't have to think about how these digital components work inside&mdash;they just think of circuits being either <em>on</em> or <em>off</em> (<em>1</em> or <em>0</em>), with no in-between values.</p>
        
        <s>Below the software is the hardware (the guts of the computer)<!-- and its <em>architecture</em> (the design that specifies how those basic hardware components  fit together to do their job)-->. The hardware's job is to run whatever programs the user requests. For hardware engineers, the <!--high level of--> abstraction focuses on how to make best use of components (memory, chips, logic gates, etc.) that already have some useful built in behaviors, and often also assembling these into slightly fancier components.  </s>
        
        <s>Most of the enginneering work is based on the assumption that any the biggest jump in abstraction is between the ones and zeros that everyone talks about and the way ... most of the work is dome in the digital domain, which is the levels of abstraction in which we pretend that only ones and zeros are possible.</s>
        
        <p>In the different levels of abstraction in software, each level of abstraciton is a different piece of software, but the level of abstraction in the digital domain are four ways of thinking about the same physical object.</p>
        
        <h3>Analog Domain</h3>        
        <p>Logic gates, which are the lowest abstraction level of the digital domain, operate on ones and zeros. In physical reality, those logic gates are built out of <strong>transitors</strong>, a type of circuit component. Transitors aren't like light switches that are either on or off. There can be in-between values (like "on a little bit"). So, electrical engineers have to think about the laws of electronics to design digital circuits so that in-between values don't happen.
