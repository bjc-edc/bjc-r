		<title>Unit 6 Lab 1: Computer Abstraction Hierarchy, Page 6</title>

    <div class="todo">
Why this?  This page is about transistors, the level of abstraction below the digital abstraction.
<p>Why here?  There will be three pages, including this one, about the parts of the abstraction hierarchy separated by the two major abstraction barriers, going from top to bottom.</p>
</div>

<H2>Below the Digital Abstraction</H2>

<p>On the previous page we said, as everyone says when talking about computers, that a wire can either have a voltage or not have a voltage on it. But the reality is more complicated. The on-or-off picture of a wire, or a transistor, or a logic gate output, is a simplification â€” an abstraction. On the previous page we were in the<em> digital domain.</em> On this page, welcome to the <em>analog domain.</em></p>
<p>For the most part, in BJC, if we teach about something at all, we try to do it in depth, so that you come away with a serious understanding. But a deep understanding of transistors requires talking about quantum physics. (There are things called <em>quantum computers,</em> but that's not the point here. Regular old computers are made of transistors, and a transistor works for reasons that you can't really understand without getting into quantum physics.)</p>
