		<title>Unit 6 Lab 1: Computer Abstraction Hierarchy, Page 2</title>
	</head>
    <body>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>Why this?  This page is about the two levels of abstraction above the program abstraction, from the chart on page 1.</p>
            <p>Why here?  There will be three pages, including this one, about the parts of the abstraction hierarchy separated by the two major abstraction barriers, going from top to bottom.</p>
            <p>2.1.2B In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent characters or integers limits the range of integer values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in overflow or other errors.<br />
            2.1.2C In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers (as floating point numbers) limits the range of floating point values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in roundoff errors<br />
            2.2.3A Different programming languages offer different levels of abstraction.<br />
            2.2.3B High level programming languages provide more abstractions for the programmer and make it easier for people to read and write a program.<br />
            2.2.3C Code in a programming language is often translated into code in another (lowerlevel) language to be executed on a computer.<br />
            5.5.1B Integers may be constrained in the maximum and minimum values that can be represented in a program because of storage limitations.</p>
            <p>1.3.1B Digital audio and music can be created by synthesizing sounds, sampling existing audio and music, and recording and manipulating sounds, including layering and looping.<br>
              1.3.1C Digital images can be created by generating pixel patterns, manipulating existing digital images, or combining images.<br>
              1.3.1D Digital effects and animations can be created by using existing software or modified software that includes functionality to implement the effects and animations.<br>
              7.2.1A Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science.<br>
              7.2.1B Scientific computing has enabled innovation in science and business.<br>
            7.2.1C Computing enables innovation by providing access to and sharing of information.</p>

        <h2>The Software Domain: Applications</h2>
        <p>Mostly, when we talk about software, we mean application programs (&quot;apps&quot; for short) and the operating system (often OS for short). 
Roughly, apps are the programs that <em>we</em> interact with (text editors, photo editors, calculators, music players, browsers, Snap<em>!</em>, etc.)  and operating systems are the programs that the apps interact with (like Mac OS or Microsoft Windows) to communicate with the computer.</p>
        <p>The word &quot;computer&quot; is a reminder that the first application programs were all about numbers. Scientists used computers to solve equations; businesses used computers to work out budgets and payroll.</p>
    <p>Today's computer applications have much more variety. Here are some of the things software can do:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Communication.</strong> For many people,
        

    the <strong>browser</strong>
<em>is</em> the computer.  (That's particularly true if your computer is a <em>Chromebook,</em> in which all of the traditional computer applications are on a server somewhere, and the browser is used to do everything.)  You keep in touch with friends using <strong>social networking</strong>, <strong>email</strong>, <strong>text messages</strong>, and <strong>chat</strong> applications that can be text-based, audio-based, or video-based. You can also tell the world what you think in a <strong>blog</strong>. Communication can be just for fun, or it can be to <strong>share information</strong> to help the world.</li>
        <li><strong>Sound.</strong>
Your computer or phone almost certainly has an application to <strong>play music</strong>, from your own collection or from an Internet radio server. But computers are also used to <strong>create music</strong>, including <strong>synthesizers</strong> that create new sounds, <strong>sampling</strong> of existing sounds, and <strong>recording</strong> the sounds around you.  You can also ask your phone to <strong>identify</strong> a song that you hear.</li>        
        <li><strong>Pictures.</strong>
You can keep a <strong>library</strong> of pictures on your own computer or at a photo upload server. Your phone or laptop has a <strong>camera</strong>, or maybe two, one in back for traditional picture-taking and one in front for <strong>selfies</strong>.  You can <strong>manipulate</strong> pictures to create <strong>artwork</strong>, sharpen the focus, or create &quot;fake news&quot; by combining unrelated images.</li>        
        <li><strong>Video.</strong>
You can <strong>shoot movies</strong> on your phone. You can use <strong>streaming video</strong> services to watch almost any movie ever made, or you can <strong>upload</strong> your own movies and hope to become an Internet star.  You can <strong>edit</strong> movies by combining video from different sources.  You can <strong>animate cartoons</strong> with software just for that purpose.  And you can <strong>burn</strong> your movie onto a DVD as a present for a friend.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Mining</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning.</strong>
The amount of information available on the Internet is huge. Computers can learn to combine information from different sources, to produce surprising results. <strong>Scientists</strong> teach computers to explore <strong>telescope observations</strong> to learn new things about how the physical universe works.  <strong>Businesses</strong> can combine location information from your phone with similar information from other phones to find <strong>traffic jams</strong> or <strong>popular restaurants</strong>. Or they can combine multiple sources of online information <strong>about you</strong> to send you <strong>targeted advertising</strong> for products you're likely to want, or to keep track of your <strong>political views</strong> for policing or voter registration drives.</li></ul>
