		<title>Unit 6 Lab 1: Computer Abstraction Hierarchy, Page 4</title>
	</head>

        <div class="todo">
            <p>Why this?  This page is about the two levels of abstraction above the program abstraction, from the chart on page 1.</p>
            <p>Why here?  There will be three pages, including this one, about the parts of the abstraction hierarchy separated by the two major abstraction barriers, going from top to bottom.</p>
            <p>2.1.2B In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent characters or integers limits the range of integer values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in overflow or other errors.<br />
            2.1.2C In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers (as floating point numbers) limits the range of floating point values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in roundoff errors<br />
            2.2.3A Different programming languages offer different levels of abstraction.<br />
            2.2.3B High level programming languages provide more abstractions for the programmer and make it easier for people to read and write a program.<br />
            2.2.3C Code in a programming language is often translated into code in another (lowerlevel) language to be executed on a computer.<br />
            5.5.1B Integers may be constrained in the maximum and minimum values that can be represented in a program because of storage limitations.</p>

        <h2>The Software Domain: Applications</h2>
        <p>Mostly, when we talk about software, we mean application programs (&quot;apps&quot; for short) and the operating system (often OS for short). 
Roughly, apps are the programs that <em>we</em> interact with (text editors, photo editors, calculators, music players, browsers, Snap<em>!</em>, etc.)  and operating systems are the programs that the apps interact with (like Mac OS or Microsoft Windows) to communicate with the computer.</p>
