                    The <em>factorial</em> of a positive integer <em>n </em>(written "<span class="katex">n!</span>") is the product of all the integers from 1 to <em>n</em>. For example:<br /> 
                    <span class="katex-block">5! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 = 120</span>

		<p>That <code>e+32</code> is just a different way to write scientific notation. The "e+" means "times ten to the power of" so this notation means 2.6525285981219103 &times; 10<sup>32</sup> = 265,252,859,812,191,030,000,000,000,000,000.</p>
        
		<h3>Fixed Width Computer Hardware</h3>
        <div class="comment">needs more word smithing</div>
        <p>So why did Snap<em>!</em> display 20! in ordinary whole number representation but 30! in scientific notation? Every computer model is designed with a certain<strong> width</strong>, the number of bits that the processor reads from memory or writes into memory at a time. The object composed of that number of bits is called a <strong>word</strong>. As of 2016, most new computers are 64 bits wide—that is, they have 64 bit words—but there are still a lot of 32-bit computers around.  The first microcomputer, the Intel 4004, first sold in 1971, was four bits wide!</p>
		<div class="endnote">If you got an answer in scientific notation for 20!, you're using a 32-bit computer.</div>
            <p>A 64 bit word represents 2<sup>64</sup> different values. We use about half for negative numbers, one for zero, and the rest for postives. Half of 2<sup>64</sup>, which is 2<sup>63</sup>, is about 9 &times; 10<sup>18</sup> = .</p>

        <div class="comment">"the size limitation" needs to be connected to the "two or perhaps four bytes" above.</div>
        <p><strong>What's going on?</strong> Although <span class="katex">200!</span> is very large, it's not infinite. This report is the result of the size limitation. If the result of a computation is bigger than than the range of numbers that can be stored, then the computer returns a special code or an overflow error.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
            In Snap<em>!</em>, there are special codes for infinity, &ndash;infinity (smaller than any finite value), and "Not a Number," which is the notification used for illegal computations such as <span class="katex">\frac00</span>.<br />

        <h4><strong>Storing Text</strong></h4>
		<div class="sidenoteBig">You can learn more about Unicode if you do the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-cybersecurity/3-caesar-cipher.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Caesar Cipher Project</a> in the Cybersecurity lab, where you create a program to encrypt a message.</div>
        <p>It's common for programming languages to use a <em>specific</em> number of bits to represent Unicode characters or integers. Unicode is a system that allows computers to store letters as integers. For example, capital A is Unicode number 65, which is 01000001<sub>2</sub>.</p>

        <div class="todo">move 200! to floating point page. --MF, 11/1/17
				<li>
                    Then, try <span class="katex">200!</span>.<br />

        <!--<div class="sidenoteBig">A floating point value begins with a single <strong>sign bit</strong> (0 for positive or 1 for negative), then it has a specific number of bits for the <strong>exponent</strong>, and it ends with a specific number of bits for the <strong>significand</strong>, which everything after the decimal point. (In binary, the only digit that can be before the decimal in scientific notation is a 1.)</div>-->
        <p>Many languages have another data type used to represent real numbers (including decimals and numbers too big to be stored as integers) called <strong>floating point</strong>, which is essentially a binary version of scientific notation. It's called floating point because the decimal point "floats" to just after the first digit.</p>

        <div class="takeNote">Floating point allows computers to store very large numbers and also decimals, but the format still has a specific number of bits, and that limits the range of floating point values and mathematical operations just like with integers. However with floating point, values that exceed the limitation may result in <em>round off</em> errors instead.</div>
        <p>Most real numbers can't be represented exactly&mdash;even with floating point.</p>

        <p>The decimal representation of <span class="katex">\frac13</span> is 0.33333... It has infinitely many digits, so the closest you can come in floating point isn't <em>exactly</em> <span class="katex">\frac13</span>; it gets cut off after a while because your computer doesn't ahve enough memory.</p>
        <p>Roundoff errors can result in some pretty weird calculations...</p>

        <p>This isn't a bug with Snap<em>!</em>. Many other languages (like JavaScript) will report the same values for these calculations.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
        	<p>Computer arithmetic on <em>integers</em> is straightforward. Either you get an exactly correct integer result or, if the result won't fit in integer representation, you get an <em>overflow error</em> and the result is, usually, converted to floating point representation (like <span class="katex">30!</span> was).</p>
            <p>By contrast, computer arithmetic on <em>floating point numbers</em> is hard to get exactly right. Prior to 1985, every model of computer had a slightly different floating point format, and all of them got wrong answers to certain problems. This situation was resolved by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point" target="_blank">IEEE 754 floating point standard</a>, which is now used by every computer manufacturer and has been improved several times since it was created in 1985.</p>

        <p><strong>How does a programming language know whether to interpret a bit sequence as an integer, a floating point, a text string of Unicode characters, an instruction, or something else?</strong> Programming languages differ in how they do this, but there's always some <em>extra</em> bit sequence that encodes the <em>data type</em> of any sequence of bits that tells the computer how to interpret it.</p>
		<div class="takeNote">At the lowest level of software abstraction, <em>everything</em> in a computer is represented as a binary sequence. For example:
        	<ul>
            	<li>A Boolean value is a single bit, 0 for <code>false</code> and 1 for <code>true</code>.</li>
                <li>A text string is a sequence of Unicode character codes, each of which is stored as a separate integer.</li>
                <li>Lists and blocks are binary sequences too.</li>
            </ul>
