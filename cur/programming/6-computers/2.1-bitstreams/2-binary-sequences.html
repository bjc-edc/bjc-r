		<h2>Representing Numbers</h2>
		<p>A binary sequence (a bunch of bits) can represent any kind of information, but for the rest of this lab we're going to concentrate on numbers.</p>
		<h3>Integers</h3>

                    The <em>factorial</em> of a positive integer <em>n </em>(written "<em>n</em>&thinsp;!") is the product of all the integers from 1 to <em>n</em>. For example:<br /> 
                    <span class="katex-block">5! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 = 120</span>
                    Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/6-computers/U6L2-BigNumbers.xml">this project</a>, and try out these inputs:<br />

<p>Huh?

	Apparently 30! is a decimal fraction, 2.65..., and what's that &quot;e+32&quot; at the end?
<p>What you're seeing is  <em>scientific notation.</em> The &quot;e&quot; means &quot;times ten to the power,&quot; so this notation means
<p>2.6525285981219103 × 10 <sup>32</sup>
	= 265252859812191030000000000000000
<h3>Fixed Width Computer Hardware</h3>
<p>So why did Snap<em>!</em> display 20! in ordinary whole number representation, just a string of digits, but 30! in scientific notation? You already know that computers use bits to store information, including numbers. The new thing for you to learn is that every computer model is designed with a certain<strong> width</strong>, the number of bits that the processor reads from memory or writes into memory at a time. The object composed of that number of bits is called a <strong>word</strong>. As we write this in 2016, most new computers are 64 bits wide—that is, they have 64 bit words—but there are still a lot of 32-bit computers around.  The first microcomputer, the Intel 4004, first sold in 1971, was four bits wide!
<div class="takeNote"><p>If you got an answer in scientific notation for 20!, you're using a 32-bit computer.</p></div>
<div class="endnote">
<p>Processor widths don't have to be a power of two. Some old computers—the kind  you see in old movies that filled a large room—used 12-bit, 36-bit, and 60-bit words. But modern personal computers started at 8 bits and the widths have been doubling with each new generation.</p></div>
<div class="sidenote">The largest representable positive integer is actually one less than 2<sup>63</sup> because zero takes up one of the positive integer values.</div>
<p>On a 64-bit computer, if you want to represent both positive and negative integers, <em>one </em>word can fit 2<sup>63</sup>=9223372036854775808 of each (2<sup>64</sup> nunbers altogether). 2<sup>63</sup> is about 9 quintillion, 9×10<sup>18</sup>. That means that the 19-digit value of 20! just fits in a word, but the 33-digit 30! doesn't.</p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="2">
  <li>What's the <em>first</em> integer whose factorial doesn't fit in a word?</li>
</ol></div>
 <h3>Bignums </h3>
 <p>All computers have a finite amount of memory. So it's not a surprise that there's a limit to the size of integers a computer can represent exactly.  But that limit is way more than 64 bits; your computer probably has 137 <em>billion</em> or more bits of memory.  Why can't programming languages just use more than one word if necessary to represent an integer? 
 <p>They can.  It's just that the language that computers &quot;natively&quot; know adds one-word numbers with a single machine intruction, whereas the person who designs the programming language that <em>we</em> write in must work a little harder to make &quot;add&quot; work with multiple-word values. (A multiple-word integer value is called a <strong>bignum</strong>.) The <em>best</em> programming languages do that; remember that the whole point of computer science is abstraction, and one important kind of abstraction is protecting the user from having to know about hardware limitations.  Alas, all   the languages you are most likely to have heard of limit integer values to what fits in a word.

   <p>The paradigmatic example of a great programming language is <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/index.html">Scheme</a>. You can learn it from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html"> a wonderful computer science book</a> (in our opinion, the best ever written).</p></div>
 <div class="takeNote">This business about better and worse languages isn't just a question of taste; it can be a matter of life and death.  Between 1985 and 1987, a therapeutic X-ray machine called the Therac-25 killed four patients and seriously injured two more because of several bugs in its software; one of the bugs was that a usage counter that was kept in an eight-bit-wide variable would reach its maximum value of 127 and then
 <strong>overflow</strong> to zero instead of 128.  When the variable was zero, an important safety check was not performed.  This would not have happened if the Therac software had been written in a better programming language.</div>

    <li>How many digits are there in 200!&thinsp;? Hint: Don't count by hand; you have a computer.</li></ol></div>
    <h3>Floating Point</h3>
    <p>The computer representation for non-integer values is called <em>floating point.</em></p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <a href="#hint-float" data-toggle="collapse">Where did that funny name come from?</a>
      <div id="hint-float" class="collapse">This non-obvious name is used because there used to be a <em>fixed point</em> non-integer notation with a <em>fixed</em> number of digits after the decimal <em>point.</em> For example, a fixed point notation with two digits after the decimal point was used to represent an amount of money: $82.47 The fraction part is the number of cents. But today's computers always use floating point for non-integer values.</div></div>
    <div class ="forYouToDo"><ol start="7">
  <li>Turn bignums off and try 200! again.<br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/200bang-fixnum.png" alt="((200) !) -&gt; infinity"></li></ol></div>
   

<p>What's up with <em>that?</em> We've already seen that 200!, although it's very large, isn't infinite. Computers are perfectly capable of handling it. As you might guess, this is also the result of a size limitation. The <strong>floating point</strong> representation that computers use for non-integers (and, in a non-bignum language, integers that are too big for the integer representation) can only represent numbers up to about 10<sup>308</sup>. But 200! is about 8×10<sup>374</sup> (as you should know if you did problem 7). If the result of a computation is bigger than that, floating point hardware returns a special code that represents Infinity.</p>
<div class="takeNote">
  <p>Floating point is essentially a binary version of scientific notation. <a id="hintbutton" onClick="document.getElementById('hintbutton').innerHTML='A 64-bit floating point value has a <strong>sign bit</strong> that&rsquo;s 0 for a positive number or 1 for a negative number; an 11-bit <strong>exponent</strong> part representing the range from 2<sup>-1022</sup> to 2<sup>1023</sup>; and a 52-bit <strong>fraction</strong> or <strong>significand</strong> part representing the actual digits of the number. There are special codes for Infinity, -Infinity (smaller than any finite value), and &quot;Not a Number,&quot; the result of illegal computations such as 0/0. (We&rsquo;re leaving out some details that aren&rsquo;t important in this course.)';">(Click for details.)</a></p>
  <p><em>Most</em> real numbers, not just especially large ones, are not exactly representable in this format. Think about the decimal representation of 1/3, 0.33333... It has infinitely many digits, so the closest you can come in floating point isn't <em>exactly</em> 1/3. That's why even great programming languages set a limit to the number of digits representable in floating point notation.</p></div>
  <div class="forYouToDo">
  <p>On the other hand, fractions such as 1/3 <em>can</em> be represented exactly using a pair of integers, one for the numerator and one for the denominator.</p>

<li>Try<img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/one-third.png" alt="1 / 3"> with bignums off and with bignums on.</li></ol></div>
  <div class="takeNote">
  <p><a id="hintbutton2" onClick="document.getElementById('hintbutton2').innerHTML='Computer arithmetic on integers is straightforward.  Either you get an exactly correct result or, if the correct result wouldn&rsquo;t fit in the representation you&rsquo;re using, you get an <strong>overflow</strong> and the result is, usually, converted to floating point representation.  By contrast, computer arithmetic on floating point real numbers is very, very hard to get exactly right.  Prior to 1985, every model of computer had a slightly different floating point format, and all of them got wrong answers to certain problems.  This situation was resolved by the <strong>IEEE 754</strong> floating point standard, designed by &#x263a; University of California, Berkeley &#x263a; Professor William Kahan, a mathematician and computer scientist who did the first truly adequate analysis of what&rsquo;s required to get answers to floating point computations that are as correct as possible given a limited number of bits.  Today every computer manufacturer uses Professor Kahan&rsquo;s standard (which has been improved several times since 1985).';">Floating point is messy. (Click for details.)</a></p>

<div class="takeItFurther"><ol type="A">
<li>Imagine a <em>decimal</em> floating point representation with one significand digit, and a range of exponents from 10<sup>-2</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup>.  The smallest positive number representable in this notation is 0.01 (1×10<sup>-2</sup>) and the largest is 900 (9×10<sup>2</sup>).  Sketch a number line from 0 to 1000 and mark all of the positive values representable in this notation.  What can you say about the spacing of values?  How many fractional values are representable?  How many integer values less than 1000 are <em>not</em> representable?  What are the strengths and weaknesses of this choice of representable values?  (Real floating point has many more representable values, of course, but the way they're spaced on the number line is similar to this.)</li></ol></div>
  <h3>Binary Sequences in Context</h3>
<p>Here's the binary representation of 20! in 64-bit integer format:</p>
<p>0010000111000011011001110111110001000010101101000000000000000000</p>
<p>As an integer, that pattern of bits represents 243290200817664000. But <em>that same pattern of bits</em> represents</p>
<p>4.85611351839403586987046017196×10<sup>-146</sup></p>
<p>when considered as a floating point representation. The same pattern of bits may <em>also</em> represent an instruction in the machine language of whatever computer you're using. This is so important we're going to say it in boldface: <span style="background-color: #fcc589"><strong>The meaning of a sequence of bits depends on the context in which it is used.</strong></span> That's the take-away understanding you should get from this page, after you've forgotten details such as how many bits there are in a word.</p>
<p>What exactly do we mean by &quot;context&quot;? How does a programming language know whether to interpret a bit sequence as an integer, a float, a string of characters, an instruction, or something else? There's always <em>another</em> bit sequence somewhere that encodes the <strong>data type</strong> of the bit sequence.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <a href="#hint-data-types" data-toggle="collapse">But different languages use data types differently.</a>
      <div id="hint-data-types" class="collapse">
<p>In great languages, that data type code is attached to the value itself. In ordinary languages, when you make a variable, you have to say what type of value it will contain, and the data type is attached to the <em>variable</em>, so you can't get exact answers when the values are integers and also be able to handle non-integer values of the same variable. So instead of seeing</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/varfoo.png" alt="script variables (foo)"></p>
<p>you see things like</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/intfoo.png" alt="integer (foo)"></p>
<p>We're telling you all these things because Snap<em>!</em> has strengths that many  programming languages do not, and it's very likely that your <em>next</em> year's computer science class will use one of those other languages. For example, if you take the AP Computer Science A course, it will use Java.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="takeNote">All through this page we've been talking about numbers, but don't forget that, at the lowest level of software abstraction, <em>everything</em>

in a computer is represented as a binary sequence. A Boolean value is a single bit, 0 for <code>false</code> and 1 for <code>true</code>.
 A character string is a sequence of Unicode character codes, each of which is a small integer&mdash;
	a sequence of bits. Lists and procedures, too, are binary sequences, but the precise format is beyond the scope of this course.</div>
