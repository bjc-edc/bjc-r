Computer modeling and simulation makes experimentation and theory testing safer, faster, and cheaper and is used in many areas including climate research.

                        <p>Computing innovations influence and are influenced by the economic, social and cultural contexts in which they are designed and used. Unequal distribution of computing resources raises issues of equity, access and power—the global digital divide. There are efforts both by government and by private corporations—for example, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s internet.org project—that aim to bring the Internet and provide infrastructure to parts of the world currently without access.</p>

                        <p>Widespread access to digitized information raises legal and ethical questions about ownership and control of intellectual property—the creative work of others. Copyright protects creators, but also limits others’ access to the materials. How long should copyright—for example, the Mickey Mouse copyright—last and how should that affect who may see copyright protected materials?

                    Intellectual property is one of the complex issues of computing. Identify some other issues with pros and cons, and write <em>two</em> paragraphs: one describing two benefits of computing and one describing two harmful impacts of computing.
