        <h3>Binary Timer Hints</h3>
        <p>If you study the <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Convert-from-Decimal-to-Binary" target="_blank">examples presented here</a>, you will notice that method 2 (<em>Descending Powers of Two and Subtraction</em>) is easier to understand and code so it is recommended that you try this first.  The algorithm goes something like this:</p>
        <p class="indent"><em>Starting with the largest power of 2 down to the lowest power of 2  (in our case from 2<sup>7</sup>  to 2<sup>0</sup> as there are 8 binary digits) check if that power of 2 is contained in the number (i.e. if the number is greater than or equal to that power of 2.)  If so, write 1 for the current binary digit and replace the number with that power of 2 subtracted from the number.  Otherwise, write 0 for the current binary digit.</em></p>

			Implementing <code>Get Binary Digits</code> with this method we get:<br />

		</p>
        
        <p>If you decide to code <code>Get Binary Digits</code> with method 1 (<em>Short Division by Two with Remainder</em>), then you will need to compute a lot of remainders and quotients during division with 2, which you can get by using the <code>mod</code> and <code>floor</code> operators respectively in Snap<em>!</em>.  The code may look like this.  Notice how similar it is to the <code>Get Decimal Digits </code>code.</p>
