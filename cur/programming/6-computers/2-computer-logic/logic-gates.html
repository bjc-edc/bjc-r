		<h2>Hardware Level Boolean Logic</h2>
		<div class="todo">
            <p>
                <strong>Why this?</strong><br />
                The goal is to support students on the logic gate questions on the exam, connect these ideas to the theme of the unit (how computers work), and support these standards:
                <ul>
                    <li>2.2.3F A logic gate is a hardware abstraction that is modeled by a Boolean function. Exclusion Statement (2.2.3F): Memorization of specific gate visual representations is beyond the scope of this course and the AP Exam.</li>
                    <li>EK 2.2.3I Hardware is built using multiple levels of abstractions, such as transistors, logic gates, chips, memory, motherboards, special purposes cards, and storage devices.</li>
                    <li>EU 5.5 Programming uses mathematical and logical concepts.</li>
                    <li>LO 5.5.1 Employ appropriate mathematical and logical concepts in programming. [P1]</li>
                    <li>EK 5.5.1E Logical concepts and Boolean algebra are fundamental to programming.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>(Note that we introduced <strong>Booleans</strong> in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/1-variables-games/1-number-guessing-game.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">2.1.1</a> and students used <strong>Boolean operators</strong> in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/1-adding-questions.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">2.3.1</a>, <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/2-keeping-list-items.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">2.3.2</a>, and <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/3-solving-word-puzzle.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">2.3.3</a>.)</p>
            <p><strong>Why here?</strong> I (Mary) originally thought that this page belonged after or at the end of Number Representation, but since I've got all the adder stuff, I think it should just go where it fits in the story. </p>
        </div>
        
		<div class="learn"><strong>On this page,</strong> you explore how review three Boolean operators (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>) and learn how they relate to electronic circuitry.</div>
        
         <p>In a circuit with billions of transistors, or even thousands of transistors, hardware designers can't think about each individual transistor. Just as programmers use abstraction, hardware architects use abstractions, in which a group of transistors and other circuit elements are considered as a single thing. What kinds of things? There are basically two kinds, one for memory and one for computation.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
        	<a href="#hint-memory" data-toggle="collapse">Learn more about memory.</a>
			<div id="hint-memory" class="collapse">
            	<p>Memory is made out of <em>flip-flops.</em> (They're officially called "bistable multivibrators" but you can see why nobody actually uses that name.) A flip-flop is a circuit that has two stable states, on and off. An input signal can tell it to change state, or to become on, or to become off.  Once that happens, the flip-flop stays in that state until it gets another signat. It has an output that reflects its state: on if the flip-flop is on, off if it's off.</p>
				<p>A flip-flop is generally made out of four transistors. A <em>register</em> in the processor is a group of flip-flops. If it's a 32-bit processor, a register is 32 flip-flops, and the same for other processor widths.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The circuits to do computation are more interesting. They compute <em>functions,</em> just like reporters in Snap<em>!</em>. Since computers do a lot of arithmetic, you might think that the basic circuit functions would be addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but that's not the case. Of course there <em>are</em> circuits to do those things, but they're made out of <em>logic gates:</em> circuits that compute Boolean functions: <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>. The reason that Boolean functions are considered more fundamental is that their inputs and outputs can be represented with a single wire going into or out from the circuit.  That's not true about arithmetic functions.  If you consider a voltage on a wire as meaning 1, and no voltage as meaning 0, then you have to see that an adder will have <em>three</em> possible output values, because 1+1=2, which is neither 0 nor 1.  By contrast, if you consider a voltage on a wire as meaning True, and no voltage as meaning False, then the output from a Boolean function of two inputs can still only be True or False, so only one output wire is needed.</p>
        
        <h3>Boolean Operators</h3>
        <p>
			<div class="sidenote">Technically, the circuitry is more complex than being "either on or off." <div class="todo">Include nod to whatever we do with <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/1-abstraction/11-analog.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F6-how-computers-work.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Below the Digital Abstraction</a>.</div></div>
            At the very lowest level, computer circuitry is made of wires, and each wire is either on or off. So the only operations that can be performed at that lowest level are those that <em>operate on single-bit values</em> (just ones and zeros, that is, just ons and offs). These are called <strong>logical (or Boolean) operations</strong>, and you saw some examples in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/1-adding-questions.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 2 Lab 3: Making Decisions by Using Predicates</a>: <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>, and <code>NOT</code>:<br />

        <h2>Logic Gates</h2>
        <p>Inside a computer, Boolean operations are implemented in phyiscal circuitry by logic gates. Logic gates are often represented with drawings that help engineers see how the information will flow through a circut. For example, the following diagram of a logic gate represents the Boolean expression <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/(a)or((a)and(b))-booleans.png" alt="A or (A and B)" title="A or (A and B)" />. Can you see how?</p>
