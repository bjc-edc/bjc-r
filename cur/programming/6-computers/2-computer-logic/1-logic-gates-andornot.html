	<h2>Logic Gates: AND, OR, NOT </h2>
    
    <p>Computers deal with 0' and 1's and you may wonder how they are able to execute their vast variety of complex tasks -involving thousands of decisions and computations- using only such simple binary digits.  At the heart of digital electronics are elementary devices called <strong>logic gates</strong> which emulate Boolean functions you are already familiar with, such as : AND, OR and NOT.  The inputs to these functions are binary (False/True or 0/1) as is the output.  In this lab you will catch a glimpse of how electronic circuitry can mimic Boolean operators and how elementary logic gates can be combined to manipulate and process binary digits to perform complex arithmetic tasks such as adding two numbers.</p>

                    <p>A point is in A <em>AND</em> B (intersection) if and only if it is both in A and in B.</p>
                    <p>The following electric circuit may give you an idea how it is possible to emulate the Boolean operator AND electronically.</p>

    <p>Two switches are in series. The current flows and light bulb turns ON, if and only if both switches are ON.</p> 
    
    <p><strong>Daily Life Application:</strong> A burglar alarm that is activated only if the motion sensor switch is ON <strong><em>and</em></strong> the alarm sound switch is ON.
Some devices like a hedge trimmer have two safety switches that both need to be turned ON before the device is activated.

    <h3>OR-gate:<img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/LogicGates_img/Gates/OR.png" width="156" height="81" alt=""/></h3>

    A point is in A <em>OR</em> B (union) if and only if it is either in A, or in B, or in both.
    <p>The following electric circuit may give you an idea how it is possible to emulate the Boolean operator OR electronically.</p>

    <p>Two switches are in parallel. The current flows and light bulb turns ON, if and only if either or both switches are ON.</p>
 

<p><strong>Daily Life Application:</strong> Doorbell rings only if the front-door bell button is pressed or the back-door bell button is pressed or both are pressed. A fire alarm that beeps when its heat detector or its smoke detector or both are activated.</p>

    
    <h3>NOT-gate:<img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/LogicGates_img/Gates/NOT.png" width="126" height="69" alt=""/></h3>

    <img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/LogicGates_img/SetTheory/NOT_set.png"  height="200" alt=""/><br />
    <p>A point is in the <em>complement</em> of A if and only if it is <em>not</em> in A.</p>
    <p>The following electric circuit may give you an idea how it is possible to emulate the Boolean operator NOT electronically.</p>
    <img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/LogicGates_img/Animations/gif/NOT_Animation.gif" height="250" alt=""/>
    <p>If the switch is ON, the current flows through it (called a short-circuit) and then the light bulb is OFF.
	If the switch is OFF, the current directly flows to the light bulb and then the light bulb is ON.</p>
 

	<p><strong>Daily Life Application:</strong> A "kill switch" on a machinery that when turned ON will turn a working machine OFF if for example a worker is in danger etc.</p>
