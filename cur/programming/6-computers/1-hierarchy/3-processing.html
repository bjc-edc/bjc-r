        <p>A smart phone, like your laptop or desktop computer, can store numbers, pictures, text, music, all kinds of things. But the zillion locations inside its memory don't contain pictures or even numbers. Each location holds a bit of that information, appropriately called a "bit," which is just "On" or "Off." That's all. When we write, we often symbolize Off as 0, and On as 1, but the memory is not storing 0s and 1s. Bits are just On or Off. When we test a bit to see if it's on, the test returns a Boolean value: if the bit is On, it returns True else False, for which we also use 1 and 0 and 1 as a convenient shorthand. If we could see inside the memory’s bits, and if we wrote it as 0s and 1s, a section of the memory might look something like this:</p>

        <p>That shows just 2369 bits. A 16 MB cell phone has sixteen megabytes (16 million bytes) of storage, each byte containing 8 bits. That's 128,000,000 bits. Printed on paper as 1s and 0s, the 16 MB phone’s memory would take nearly 40,000 pages! The information in storage—whether it is a text message, a photograph, a song, a computer program, or a list of phone numbers—looks just the same, a sequence of bits that are either On or Off (our 1s and 0s). Because the bits have only two states--On/Off, or True/False, or 1/0--we call them binary bits. A sequence of these bits is a binary sequence. So if pictures, music, and words all look the same in memory—all binary sequences—how can the computer tell what any chunk of memory actually is? For example, should the sequence 01000001 be interpreted as the number 65, the letter A, a rather dark shade of red, or something else?</p>
		<p>When your phone’s camera stores a picture in memory, your phone translates that picture, pixel  by pixel, into a long binary sequence and then adds extra information (also a binary sequence, of course, because that’s the only way information exists in a computer’s memory) saying how much information (how many bytes) to read in order to reproduce the whole picture, and how those bytes are to be interpreted. In the case of a picture, bytes are interpreted as shades of a color. If the information stored is the name of the state capital, each byte might be interpreted as a letter.</p>
        <p>Many designers are involved in building a device like the smart phone. Some work with “high level” languages (like Snap!) that let them specify how things should work—like where icons or buttons should appear on the screen and what should happen when they are touched—without also having to think about how all the information is stored inside the machine. Working with a “high level” language at a “high level of abstraction” allows them to think about the overall logic, without worrying about “low level” details.</p>
        <p>But someone in the design team for the phone does have to tell the phone’s camera-program how to translate pictures (or text or sound) into a form the memory can store, and how to generate the “extra” information that says how much data to retrieve for that picture, and that each byte of that data is to be interpreted as color information, not something else.</p>
