            Hi Selim! I was just going to paste in Paul's paragraph, but then I saw other things to mention. This was not a real review. --MF, 9/25/17<ul>
                <li>From Paul's write-up: "Hardware pages should show parts, including long-term storage chip, in a cell phone. It should also make clear that the touch panel serves both input and output, and that there are other inputs (e.g., buttons) and outputs (e.g., phone jack)."</li>
                <li>From Mary: CSS should not be included in the head of the page. Please meet with me to discuss where to put it in the CSS, or just tack it on the end preceded by a comment describing what it is.</li>
                <li>Also from Mary: I moved the image credits to sidenotes and cleaned up the tabbing in this HTML. If you are ok with these changes, you can delete this comment.</li>
                <li>Also from Mary: All of the images need alt and title attributes. Once this is done, please delete this comment.</li>

                    Computers used to take up entire rooms as shown here below (ENIAC, 1946).  Nowadays, vastly more powerful computing is available in a hand-sized smartphone where components have been miniaturized and given multiple functionality.  For example the touch screen of the smartphone acts both as an input and an output device.  Do some research on a site like <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/" target="_blank">computerhistory.org</a> and learn about the history of the evolution of computers.  Share your findings with your classmates.<br />

                Pretend you are visiting a computer store to buy computer equipment.  Prepare a list of intelligent talking points and questions to ask the technical specialist at the store to find the best products that suit your needs.  Be sure to use impressive vocabulary such as "RAM", "CPU", "gigahertz", "megabyte" etc.  You will need to do some research to find out the "state of the art" features of top line computer products.  Take turns with your partner in practicing this task.</li>

                    One can learn a tremendous amount by taking things apart and putting them back together.  Get your hands on an old abandoned computer and carefully take it apart identifying each component.  There are many online tutorials that can guide you in this process.  Here is one <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/youtube/ctAVC2JwEwI" target="_blank">video tutorial </a>that seems to be popular.<br />
