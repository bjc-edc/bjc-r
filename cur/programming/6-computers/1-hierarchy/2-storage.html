            <p>3.3 There are trade offs when representing information as digital data.</p>
            <p>3.3.1 Analyze how data representation, storage, security, and transmission of data involve computational manipulation of information. [P4]</p>
            <p>3.3.1A Digital data representations involve trade offs related to storage, security, and privacy concerns.</p>
            <p>3.3.1B Security concerns engender tradeoffs in storing and transmitting information.</p>
            <p>3.3.1C There are trade offs in using lossy and lossless compression techniques for storing and transmitting data.</p>
            <p>3.3.1D Lossless data compression reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted but allows complete reconstruction of the original data.</p>
            <p>3.3.1E Lossy data compression can significantly reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted at the cost of being able to reconstruct only an approximation of the original data.</p>
            <p>3.3.1F Security and privacy concerns arise with data containing personal information.</p>
            <p>3.3.1G Data is stored in many formats depending on its characteristics (e.g., size and intended use)</p>
            <p>3.3.1H The choice of storage media affects both the methods and costs of manipulating the data it contains.</p>
            <p>3.3.1I Reading data and updating data have different storage requirements.</p>
