		<h2>Storing Integers</h2>
        
        <div class="learn">
        	<p><strong>On this page,</strong>...</p> 
        </div>
        
        <p>Depending on the programming language used, an integer might be stored with two or perhaps four bytes of data allowing for a range of about -32,768 to 32,767 (with two bytes) or -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (with four bytes).</p>
        <div class="endnote">
        	<h4><strong>Why are these the ranges for integers?</strong></h4>
            <p>Two bytes is 16 bits, so two bytes can represent 2<sup>16</sup> = 65,536 different values. We use about half of these to represent negative numbers, about half for postive numbers, and one to represent zero.</p>
            <p>Four bytes is 32 bits, so four bytes can represent 2<sup>32</sup> = 4,294,967,296 different values. Again, we use about half for negative numbers, half for postives, and one for zero.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="takeNote"><strong>What about bigger numbers?</strong> Whatever the specific size is for storing integers (two bytes, four bytes, etc.), it will limit the range of the integer values that can be stored and the mathematical operations that can be performed. Values that exceed this limitation may result in errors such as <em>overflow</em> errors because big values overflow the amount of space allocated to store one number.</div>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
				<li>
                    <div class="sidenote">You do not need to learn the factorial function for this class (we are just using it to discuss big numbers), but you will probably see it again in a math class.</div>
                    The <em>factorial</em> of a positive integer <em>n </em>(written "<span class="katex">n!</span>") is the product of all the integers from 1 to <em>n</em>. For example:<br /> 
                    <span class="katex-block">5! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 = 120</span>

			</ol>
        </div>
        <div class="comment">"the size limitation" needs to be connected to the "two or perhaps four bytes" above.</div>
        <p><strong>What's going on?</strong> Although <span class="katex">200!</span> is very large, it's not infinite. This report is the result of the size limitation. If the result of a computation is bigger than than the range of numbers that can be stored, then the computer returns a special code or an overflow error.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
            In Snap<em>!</em>, there are special codes for infinity, &ndash;infinity (smaller than any finite value), and "Not a Number," which is the notification used for illegal computations such as <span class="katex">\frac00</span>.<br />

        <h4><strong>Storing Text</strong></h4>
		<div class="sidenoteBig">You can learn more about Unicode if you do the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-cybersecurity/3-caesar-cipher.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Caesar Cipher Project</a> in the Cybersecurity lab, where you create a program to encrypt a message.</div>
        <p>It's common for programming languages to use a <em>specific</em> number of bits to represent Unicode characters or integers. Unicode is a system that allows computers to store letters as integers. For example, capital A is Unicode number 65, which is 01000001<sub>2</sub>.</p>
