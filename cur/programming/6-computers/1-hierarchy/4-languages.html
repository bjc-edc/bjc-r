            <p>2.2 Multiple levels of abstraction are used to write programs or create other computational artifacts</p>
            <p>2.2.3A Different programming languages offer different levels of abstraction.</p>
            <p>2.2.3B High level programming languages provide more abstractions for the programmer and make it easier for people to read and write a program.</p>
            <p>2.2.3C Code in a programming language is often translated into code in another (lowerlevel) language to be executed on a computer.</p>

            <p><em>4.1 Algorithms are precise sequences of instructions for processes that can be executed by a computer and are implemented using programming languages.</em></p>
            <p><em>4.1.2 Express an algorithm in a language. [P5]</em></p>
            <p><em>4.1.2A Languages for algorithms include natural language, pseudocode, and visual and textual programming languages.</em></p>
            <p><em>4.1.2B Natural language and pseudocode describe algorithms so that humans can understand them.</em></p>
            <p><em>4.1.2C Algorithms described in programming languages can be executed on a computer.</em></p>
            <p><em>4.1.2I Clarity and readability are important considerations when expressing an algorithm in a language.</em></p>
            <p>4.1.2D Different languages are better suited for expressing different algorithms.</p>
            <p>4.1.2E Some programming languages are designed for specific domains and are better for expressing algorithms in those domains.</p>
            <p>4.1.2F The language used to express an algorithm can affect characteristics such as clarity or readability but not whether an algorithmic solution exists.</p>
            <p>4.1.2G Every algorithm can be constructed using only sequencing, selection, and iteration.</p>
            <p>4.1.2H Nearly all programming languages are equivalent in terms of being able to express any algorithm.</p>
