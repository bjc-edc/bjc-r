		<h2>Data Compression</h2>
		<div class="todo">
            <p>3.3.1C There are trade offs in using lossy and lossless compression techniques for storing and transmitting data.<br>
              3.3.1D Lossless data compression reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted but allows complete reconstruction of the original data<br>
            3.3.1E Lossy data compression can significantly reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted at the cost of being able to reconstruct only an approximation of the original data.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Even just displaying a picture on your screen, without moving it, involves complexity that a programmer shouldn't have to think about. An app must find out the size of the picture (usually expressed in "pixels," short for "picture elements"). Each pixel is represented by numbers, usually three (or four)  integers between 0 and 255. Not all representations  use those numbers the same way. In probably the most common system (RGB), the  three numbers represent the intensity of   Red,  Green,  and Blue in that pixel. When all are 0, we see black; when all are 255, we see white. If R is 0, G is 120, and B is 0, there is no red, no blue, and less than half the available intensity of green, so we see a dark green. Other combinations make other colors.  </p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <a href="#hint-color-codes" data-toggle="collapse">Click here to learn more about Color Codes.</a>
            <div id="hint-color-codes" class="collapse">If a fourth number is used, it represents the <em>transparency,</em> like the ghost effect you used in your very first BJC project. RGB works well for lights, such as the tiny lights in your computer screen, so it is great for computers. But it's not good for printers: no combination of Red,  Green and Blue sprayed on paper would quite make black, and zero of each would leave the paper white. Ink or paint colors are measured in CMYK: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black. And some colors such as brown and brick-red (darker than pure red) are hard to figure out in RGB units, even for display in lights. Another color system is called HSB, for <em>hue, saturation, brightness.</em> Snap<em>!</em>'s system is similar to HSB: "pen color" is hue (location on the rainbow); "pen shade" is more or less saturation (zero means black, 100 means full rainbow color).  </div>
        </div>
		<p>Beyond just representing color, there are also many ways (file formats like BMP, PNG, GIF, and JPG or JPEG) to store the picture information in long-term memory.  These formats differ in compression (more on that below) and in how the computer finds the <em>dimensions</em> of the picture (width and height, in pixels). And the application also has to know how to put the picture up on the actual screen. So application programmers use <em>graphics libraries</em> to take care of these details.</p> 

        
		<h3>Data Compression</h3>        
        <p>Why <em>are</em> there so many picture formats, anyway? One  reason is the usefulness of different <strong>data compression algorithms</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            Here's a picture of the BJC logo:<br />
            <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/bjc-logo-original.png" alt="BJC logo uncompressed" title="BJC logo uncompressed" />
        </p>
        <p>This picture is 158 pixels wide, and 186 pixels tall, for a total of 29,388 pixels. The BMP (bitmap) format includes each of those pixels in the picture file, at four bytes per pixel, so the file size is about 120kB.</p>
        <p>This is an inefficient way to store the information. That's especially true for a cartoon-like picture such as this one. Think about the 158 pixels in the top row. </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/top-row-of-pixels-in-bjc-logo.png" alt="top-row-of-pixels-in-bjc-logo">...</p>
        <p>The first 60 or so are transparent. Then come five pixels of mustard yellow (the top slice of the "b").The rest are transparent. So instead of storing a representation for all 158 pixels, we could just store six values:</p>
        <table width="30%" border="4" cellspacing="8" alt="60, transparent, 5, mustard yellow, 93, transparent">
            <tr>
                <th width="47%" scope="col">how many</th>
                <th width="53%" scope="col">what color</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td align="right">60&nbsp;</td>
                <td>&nbsp;(transparent)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td align="right">5&nbsp;</td>
                <td bgcolor="#EBBC71">&nbsp;231,167,32</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td align="right">93&nbsp;</td>
                <td>&nbsp;(transparent)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p> This is called <em>run-length encoding</em>.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <a href="#hint-run-length-encoding" data-toggle="collapse">Click to learn more about run-length encoding.</a>
            <div id="hint-run-length-encoding" class="collapse">
                Not all the rows are that simple. A slice across the picture near the top of the <em>j</em> looks like this.<br /> 
                ... <img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/bjc-logo-original-middle-row.png" alt="bjc-logo-original-middle-row"> ... <br /> 
                Storing the length of each  color run would require 24 pieces of information. But even this is better than 158. 
                <p>These days, the size of one picture isn't so significant, but think about every frame of a movie, and think about the time required to send the information over the Internet. Compression makes it easier to stream that movie to you.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Run-length encoding doesn't <em>lose</em> any information. The original picture can be reconstructed with every pixel exactly correct. This is an example of <em>lossless compression.</em></p>
        
        <p>Run-length encoding doesn't do well if the picture is a photograph, in which every pixel may be slightly different in color from its neighbors.  (If the length of each color run is just one pixel, storing just the colors uses half as much information as storing both run length <em>and</em> color.) So there are other compression algorithms. The PNG  (Portable Network Graphics, pronounced "ping") encoding does <em>lossless</em> compression of arbitrary pictures. Its algorithm is complicated, using several different strategies depending on how  color varies in each small chunk of the image. The thing to remember is that PNG is lossless.</p>
        <p>Some algorithms use <strong>lossy compression</strong>. This lets file size  be even smaller, but the original picture can't be perfectly reconstructed; information is lost. This would be terrible if these algorithms were used to compress a computer program or a novel, but people's perception of pictures does not  require extreme precision.</p>
        <p>The most commonly used lossy compression algorithm for pictures is called JPEG (or JPG, both pronounced "jay peg") for "Joint Photographic Experts Group," the committee that invented it. Lossy algorithms usually let you control the degree of precision. Below are two versions of a picture measuring 256×192 pixels and the file sizes in various formats.</p>
        <table width="56%" border="4" cellspacing="8" summary="compression factors example">
            <tr>
                <th scope="col">format</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>BMP (encoding every pixel individually)</td>
                <td>148 kB</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>PNG</td>
                <td>106 kB</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>JPEG set at "best" in the Preview app on a Mac</td>
                <td>94 kB</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>JPEG set at "worst" in the Preview app on a Mac</td>
                <td>5 kB</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            Notice how tiny the JPEG worst file is! It must look terrible, right? Here are  that 5kB file and the original, uncompressed BMP file. Can you tell which is which?<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/pond.bmp" alt="pond pebbles" title="pond pebbles" />
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/pond.jpg" alt="pond pebbles" title="pond pebbles" />
        </p>
        <p>
            JPEG compression is designed for photographs; it's not so good for cartoon-like images. Here's the BJC logo in "best" and "worst" JPEG versions:<br />
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/bjc-logo-jpeg-best.jpg" alt="BJC logo, JPEG best">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/bjc-logo-jpeg-worst.jpg" alt="BJC logo, JPEG worst"><br>
            The "best" one isn't too bad, but if you zoom in you can see "jaggies": a stairstep effect at the edges of the letters.  The "worst" one has even worse jaggies, wrong colors in the B, and bits of fuzz in what should be the transparent areas near the letters.

        <div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Lossy vs. Lossless</strong>
            <p><strong>Lossless</strong> compression (like PNG) is <em>reversible</em> (no loss in quality); you can reconstruct the original data. It works by removing redundant data.</p>
            <p><strong>Lossy</strong> compression (like JPG) is <em>not</em> fully reversible; you can only reconstruct an <em>approximation</em> of the original data. It works by removing details that people aren't likely to notice. </p>
