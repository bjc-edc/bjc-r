Perhaps, we can get the B&amp;W version to work as a project, but we still need to resolve some issues with the sequence requiring a flag (e.g., "TEXT") at the front so it isn't treated as a number (if I recall correctly). I don't like the flag solution because it breaks the idea that text can be stored as ones and zeros if we have to include something that is not ones and zeros with it.</li>
                <li>The PHP script that I used to get the binary sequences for images is here: <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/utilities/colorreader.php" target="_blank">http://localhost/bjc-r/utilities/colorreader.php</a>. Edit the $im variable initialization (currently line 9) to change the path of the color file exported into a binary sequence, and edit the $imbw initialization (currently line 59) to change the B&amp;W file. It would be amazing to incorporate this into the project, but that would require being able to handle uploaded images or images with an existing URL, and I haven't thought through that possibility yet. --MF, 11/30/17</li>

        	<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will explore how different kinds of information are represented in a computer.</p>
        	<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will meet the central ideas of <em>bits</em> and <em>bit sequences.</em></p> 
        </div>
        
        <h3>One Bit</h3>
        <p>As you know, information travels over wires inside the computer, and because of the digital abstraction, each wire is either <em>on</em> or <em>off,</em> with no intermediate states allowed.  This small piece of information is called a <strong>bit</strong>, the smallest possible unit of information in the digital domain.</p>

        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
            <strong>: Bit</strong>
            <p>A <strong>bit</strong> is a single unit of data that can only have one of two values. We usually represent the two values as "0" and "1."</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            What does a bit <em>mean?</em> By convention, the two states of a bit are labelled 0 and 1, but don't think that that means they have to represent numbers. A single bit can represent:
            <ul>
                <li>False and True.</li>
                <li>Off and On, simulating a light switch.</li>
                <li>Red and Green, simulating a traffic light.</li>
                <li>... and many more.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>But what if the traffic light also has a yellow value?  It's tempting to say that, for example, 0 volts on the wire means red, 1 volt means yellow, and 2 volts means green.  But then we would have all the problems of electrical noise that the digital abstraction was designed to avoid.</p>
        <p>
            Instead, we use <em>more than one bit</em> if we need to represent more than two possible values.  So, for the traffic light, we could use two bits:
            <table width="40%" align="center" border="4" cellspacing="8">
                <tr>
                    <th scope="col"><div align="right">first bit</div></th>
                    <th scope="col"><div align="left">second bit</div></th>
                    <th scope="col"><div align="left">meaning</div></th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td align="right">0&nbsp;</td>
                    <td>&nbsp;0</td>
                    <td>&nbsp;red</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td align="right">0&nbsp;</td>
                    <td>&nbsp;1</td>
                    <td>&nbsp;yellow</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td align="right">1&nbsp;</td>
                    <td>&nbsp;0</td>
                    <td>&nbsp;green</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td align="right">1&nbsp;</td>
                    <td>&nbsp;1</td>
                    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(unused)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </p>
        <p>There are four possible combinations of two bits, so with two bits we can represent up to four different values, although we needed only three for the traffic light.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>Convince yourself that there aren't any more combinations of two bits.</li>
                <li>Write down all the possible combinations of <em>three</em> bits.  How many are there?</li>
                <li>How many combinations of <em>four</em> bits are there?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>Each added bit <em>doubles</em> the number of values you can represent. This means that representing complex situations doesn't cost a lot of hardware; ten bits is enough to represent over 1000 distinct values.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="4">
                <li>How many values, exactly?</li>

                <li>How many bits do you need to represent one decimal digit?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>Bits aren't expensive, but what <em>is</em>  expensive is circuitry to let the programmer use exactly the smallest number of bits for a particular problem. </p>

          <code>ldb</code>

            <p>This much control over the use of memory was great for a machine that would largely be programmed at the machine language level, the lowest possible level of abstraction in the software domain. As higher level languages grew in popularity, computer architecture designers learned that <em>compilers,</em> the programs that translate a high level language into the machine language that the computer can actually run, could generate more efficient translations if the machine language was as simple as possible, doing a few things really quickly rather than doing a lot of things at varying speeds.</p></div></div>

        <p>Modern computers generally allow memory allocation in two sizes: the <strong>byte</strong>, which is standardized at eight bits, and the <strong>word</strong>, which can be 32 bits or 64 bits wide.</p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
            <p>A <strong>byte</strong> is eight bits.</p>
            <p>A <strong>word</strong> is 32 or 64 bits.</p>

        <div class="takeNote">
            <div class="sidenote">The exact answer for 32 bits is 4,294,967,296 so this approximation is pretty close.   </div>
            <p>How many distinct values can be represented in 32 bits? You shouldn't have to memorize the answer, because you can quickly figure out an approximation to the answer. The trick depends on the fact that 2<sup><small>10</small></sup> = 1024, which is about 1000. So every ten bits of width multiplies the number of values by 1000. So 10 bits is  a thousand values, 20 bits is a million values, 30 bits is a billion values, and 32 bits is over four billion. </p>
        </div>  
        <p>Four billion values sounds like it ought to be enough for anybody, but it's not if you're an astronomer or a banker, or Google or Facebook.  And you learned in Unit 4 that 32 bits are not enough to give every computer an Internet address.  That's why we now have 64-bit computers. </p>

      <p>AC:  Very nice, but a digression, I think,  AC <a href="#hint-ascii" data-toggle="collapse">Click for some history about character representation.</a>
      <div id="hint-ascii" class="collapse">
        <p>So, in a pinch you could use a six-bit-wide character code, and computers did that for many years. But if you want both <em>UPPER CASE</em> and <em>lower case</em> letters, you need seven bits. The first officially recognized character encoding was the seven bit ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). It included an optional eighth bit for error detection.</p>
  <p>Note the word "American" in the name of ASCII. In the early days of computers, most of them were in the United States, where we speak a language with a very small alphabet. Speakers of Spanish, French, German, and some other European languages use basically the same Latin alphabet, but with accented characters, as in the name of the main developer of Snap<em>!</em>, Jens Mönig. (The closest English sound is the "u" in "lunch.") So European computer users took over the eighth bit to double the number of characters, to include the ones they needed.</p>
  <p>The widespread use of eight-bit ASCII is the main historical reason why the eight-bit byte became standard. (Another reason is that computer circuitry can most easily deal with widths that are powers of two.)</p>

<!--.<p>Eight bits per character was enough space for most American and European languages, but as the use of computers and the Internet spread around the world, people naturally wanted to be able to write Chinese or Japanese or Arabic or Kabyle  or Russian or Tamil or... The <em>Unicode</em> character set supports about 1900 languages, using 32 modern alphabets and 107 historical alphabets that are no longer in living use.  The complete character set includes 136,755 characters.

      <div id="hint-unicode" class="collapse"><p>The most straightforward representation of Unicode uses one 32-bit word per character, which is more than enough. But program developers consider that an inefficient use of computer memory, and also, a lot of old software still in use was written when eight bits per character was standard. So Unicode characters are generally represented in a <em>multi-byte</em> representation in which the original 128 ASCII characters occupy one byte, while other characters may require up to four bytes. (It's also possible in this representation to use a multi-byte sequence to tell your word processing software that until further notice you want one-byte codes to represent a specific non-Latin alphabet.)</p></div></p></div>-->
