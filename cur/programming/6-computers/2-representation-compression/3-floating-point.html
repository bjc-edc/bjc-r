        <p>The way computers store numbers that are not integers is called <strong>floating point</strong>.</p>

            <div id="hint-float" class="collapse">This non-obvious name is used because there used to be a <em>fixed point</em> non-integer notation with a <em>fixed</em> number of digits after the decimal <em>point.</em> For example, a fixed point notation with two digits after the decimal point was used to represent an amount of money in dollars and cents: $82.47. But today's computers always use floating point for non-integer values, including money.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeNote">Floating point allows computers to store very large numbers and also decimals, but the format still has a specific number of bits, and that limits the range of floating point values and mathematical operations just as with integers. However with floating point, values that exceed the limitation may result in <em>round off</em> errors instead.</div>

            </ol>
        </div>

		<p>The decimal representation of ⅓ is 0.33333... It has infinitely many digits, so the closest you can come in floating point isn't <em>exactly</em> ⅓; it gets cut off after a while because your computer doesn't have enough memory.</p>
        <p>Roundoff errors can result in some pretty non-intuitive results...</p>
        
        
         <div class="commentBig">AC:  This is maddening.  If you enter 2/10 + 4/10, it adds the fractions and reports the reduced fraction.  If you enter 76/10 + 87/10, it gives a decimal approximtion.  What's the logic behind these choices?  I'm missing something. </div>

        	<a href="#hint-roundoff" data-toggle="collapse">How can such simple computations get wrong results?</a>
            <div id="hint-roundoff" class="collapse">These results seem surprising because a fractional value such as 0.2 can be represented exactly <em>in decimal</em> (unlike the example of ⅓). But <em>in binary,</em> only fractions whose denominator is a power of 2 can be represented exactly. So 2/16 can be represented exactly, but 2/10 can't. The binary floating point representation of 0.2 is just slightly too big, and so is the binary representation of 0.4. Adding two slightly-too-big values produces an error big enough to get to the next higher representable value.</div>
        </div>
		<p>No matter how good the hardware is, certain kinds of computations are likely to give severe errors in floating point.  One simple example is subtracting two numbers that are almost equal in value.  The correct answer will be near zero, and if it's near enough, it will <em>underflow</em> and an exact zero might be reported.</p>

            <p>A notorious example is the fate of the Ariane rocket launched on June 4, 1996 (European Space Agency 1996). In the 37th second of flight, the inertial reference system attempted to convert a 64-bit floating-point number to a 16-bit number, but instead triggered an overflow error which was interpreted by the guidance system as flight data, causing the rocket to veer off course and be destroyed.</p>
            <p>The Patriot missile defense system used during the Gulf War was also rendered ineffective due to roundoff error (Skeel 1992, U.S. GAO 1992). The system used an integer timing register which was incremented at intervals of 0.1 s. However, the integers were converted to decimal numbers by multiplying by the binary approximation of 0.1, 0.00011001100110011001100<sub>2</sub> = 209715/2097152.</p>
            <p>As a result, after 100 hours (3.6 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> ticks), an error of</p>

            <p>had accumulated. This discrepancy caused the Patriot system to continuously recycle itself instead of targeting properly. As a result, an Iraqi Scud missile could not be targeted and was allowed to detonate on a barracks, killing 28 people.</p>

        <p>Computer arithmetic on <em>integers</em> is straightforward. Either you get an exactly correct integer result or, if the result won't fit in (non-bignum) integer representation, you get an <em>overflow error</em> and the result is, usually, converted to floating point representation (as 30! was).</p>
        <p>By contrast, computer arithmetic on <em>floating point numbers</em> is hard to get exactly right. Prior to 1985, every model of computer had a slightly different floating point format, and all of them got wrong answers to certain problems. This situation was resolved by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point" target="_blank">IEEE 754 floating point standard</a>, which is now used by every computer manufacturer and has been improved several times since it was created in 1985.</p>

                If the subtle errors in floating point computation turn out to be unacceptable in a particular application, software can use alternative representations:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Exact rationals.</strong>
                    Two bignums, one for the numerator and one for the denominator, can be used to represent any fractional value exactly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Binary coded decimal.</strong> A decimal digit can be represented in four bits, with a few four-bit combinations left over for a minus sign and a decimal point. A sequence of decimal digits of any length can be used to create decimal bignums, representing exactly any fractional value that takes a finite number of decimal digits. This would avoid the 0.2+0.4 problem, but wouldn't work for problems involving ⅓.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decimal floating point.</strong> If the binary coded decimal notation is extended with a four-bit code for "times ten to the power," numbers in (base 10) scientific notation can be represented exactly.</li>

How many integer values less than 1000 are <em>not</em> representable?  What are the strengths and weaknesses of this choice of representable values?

        <p><strong>How does a programming language know whether to interpret a bit sequence as an integer, a floating point, a text string of Unicode characters, an instruction, or something else?</strong> <div class = "comment"> Does this explain my lament above?  If so, can we move it up? </div>Programming languages differ in how they do this, but there's always some <em>extra</em> bit sequence that encodes the <em>data type</em> of any sequence of bits that tells the computer how to interpret it.</p>
		<div class="takeNote">At the lowest level of software abstraction, <em>everything</em> in a computer is represented as a binary sequence. For example:

            	<li>A Boolean value is a single bit, 0 for <code>false</code> and 1 for <code>true</code>.</li>
                <li>A text string is a sequence of Unicode character codes, each of which is stored as a separate integer.</li>

                <p>In well-designed languages (those based on scheme, for example), that data type code is attached to the value itself. In other languages, when you make a variable, you have to say what type of value it will contain, and the data type is attached to the <em>variable</em>, so you can't get exact answers when the values are integers and also be able to handle non-integer values of the same variable.
