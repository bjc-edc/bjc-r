            EK 2.1.1C At a higher level, bits are grouped to represent abstractions, including but not limited to numbers, characters, and color.<br />
            EK 2.1.1D Number bases, including binary, decimal, and hexadecimal, are used to represent and investigate digital data.<br />
            EK 2.1.1E At one of the lowest levels of abstraction, digital data is represented in binary (base 2) using only combinations of the digits zero and one.
        </div>
        
        <p>We've looked at how the number of bits used to represent an integer affects how big it can be. Now we turn to the specific way a single-word  integer is encoded as bits.</p>
		<p>
        <div class ="sidenote">The word "bit" is an abbreviation for <em><strong>bi</strong>nary digi<strong>t</strong>.</em> </div> People generally use base ten (decimal) digits to write numbers. Computers, because of the digital abstraction, use base two (binary).</p>
		
		<p>
            In <strong>base 10</strong>, there are ten digits (0-9), and each place is worth <em>ten</em> times as much as the place to its right. <br />

        <h3>Reading Binary</h3>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p>In <strong>base 10</strong> notation, each place value represents a <strong>power of ten</strong>: the units place (10<sup>0</sup> = 1), the tens place (10<sup>1</sup> = 10), the hundreds place (10<sup>2</sup> = 100), the thousands place (10<sup>3</sup> = 1000), etc. So, for example:</p>
            <p class="center"> 9827  &nbsp; = &nbsp; 9 &times;  10<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 8 &times;  10<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 2 &times;  10<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 7 &times;  10<sup>0</sup></p>
			<p>
                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/binary-places(18).jpg" alt="place values in binary 10010: 1 16's 0 8's 0 4's 1 2's 0 1's" title="place values in binary 10010: 1 16's 0 8's 0 4's 1 2's 0 1's" />
           		<strong>Base 2</strong> uses the same idea but with <strong>powers of two</strong> instead of powers of ten. Binary place values represent the units place (2<sup>0</sup> = 1), the twos place (2<sup>1</sup> = 2), the fours place (2<sup>2</sup> = 4), the eights place (2<sup>3</sup> = 8), the sixteens place (2<sup>4</sup> = 16), etc. So, for example:
            </p>
			<p align="center">10010<sub>2</sub> &nbsp; = &nbsp; <strong>1 &times; 2<sup>4</sup></strong>	 &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0 &times; 2<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0 &times; 2<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;+&nbsp; <strong>1 &times; 2<sup>1</sup></strong> &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0 &times; 2<sup>0</sup> &nbsp; = &nbsp; 16 &nbsp;+&nbsp; 2 &nbsp; = &nbsp; 18<sub>10</sub></p>
		<!---  <p>One convenient thing about binary is that you don't actually have to do any multiplication; just write down the place value of the places where there's a one, and add them up. (That is, multiplying by 0 always gives 0, and multiplying by 1 just gives the power of two in that place.)</p>-->

		<h3>Writing Binary</h3>
        <div class="takeNote">
			<p>To translate from base 10 (like 89<sub>10</sub>) to base 2, <strong>first write out the binary place values</strong> by <em>doubling left from the units place</em> until you get to a value larger than your number (128 for this example). <strong>Then think</strong>, "I can take out a 64, so I write a 1 there, and there's 25 left (89&nbsp;âˆ’&nbsp;64). I have 0 thirty-twos, because I only have 25. But I can take out 16, and there's 9 left. So, 8 and 1 are the last nonzero bits.</p>
            <div class="sidenoteBig">Either way you are converting (and between any bases), always write the place values right-to-left (just as with units, tens, hundreds, etc.), and always write the number itself left-to-right.</div>
