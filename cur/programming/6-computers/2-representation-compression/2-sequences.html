        <p>So far we've been working with small chunks of data, from Boolean values (one bit) to characters (eight bits). But of course some information in your computer or smartphone is much bigger than that.</p>
        <p>For starters, characters aren't generally used one at a time; they're used in <em>text strings</em> such as "<code>Welcome<div class="comment">AC:  Say a bit more here:  each character is a byte? Give an example.</div> to the Beauty and Joy of Computing.</code>" These 43 characters occupy 43 bytes of computer memory. (In many programming languages there's a convention that every text string ends with a <em>null</em> byte, in which all eight bits are zero, a code that's reserved for this purpose. So our string might actually occupy 44 bytes.)</p>
        <p>But the real champion users of space are media files: pictures, sounds (mostly music), and video. For example, the spinning disk drive picture above takes up about 16Mb — 16 million bytes.</p>
<!--        <p>When we write, we often symbolize <em>off</em> as 0 and <em>on</em> as 1, but the memory is not storing zeros and ones. Bits are electric signals; they are either <em>on</em> or <em>off</em>. When we test a bit to see if it's on, the test returns a Boolean value: if the bit is <em>on</em>, it returns <code>true</code>; otherwise, it returns <code>false</code>.</p>

        </div>
        <p>We also use 1 and 0 and in place of <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> as a convenient shorthand. -->
        <p>If we could see inside the memory’s bits and we wrote it as zeros and ones, a section of the memory might look something like this:</p>

        	<strong>: binary sequence</strong>
            <p>A binary sequence (also called a <em>bitstream</em>) is an ordered list of bits. </p>
        </div>       
        <p>That shows just 2369 bits. A 16GB cell phone has sixteen gigabytes (about 16 billion bytes) of storage, each byte containing 8 bits. That's 128,000,000,000 bits. Printed on paper as ones and zeros, the 16 GB phone’s memory would take nearly 40,000,000 pages! The information in storage—whether it is a text message, a photograph, a song, a computer program, or a list of phone numbers—looks just the same, a sequence of bits that are either On or Off (one or zero). So if pictures, music, and words all look the same in memory—all binary sequences—how can the computer tell what any chunk of memory actually is? For example, should the sequence 01000001 be interpreted as the number 65, the letter A, a rather dark shade of red, or something else?</p>
        
        <div class="todo">
        	I'm assuming that the next three paragraphs are meant to satisfy some requirement, but it's not clear to me what EKs are involved.  For example, does the discussion of high level languages in the second paragraph below give us something not in the earlier discussion on 6.1.3? -bh<br />
        	Reads like Paul, so it's probably here for a reason ---AC
        <p>When your phone’s camera stores a picture in memory, your phone translates that picture, pixel by pixel, into a long binary sequence and then adds extra information (also a binary sequence) saying how how many bytes to read in order to reproduce the whole picture, and how those bytes are to be interpreted. In the case of a picture, bytes are interpreted as shades of a color. If the information stored is the name of the state capital, each byte might be interpreted as a letter.</p>
        <p>Many designers are involved in building a device like the smart phone. Some work with high level languages (like Snap<em>!</em>) that let them specify how things should work—like where icons or buttons should appear on the screen and what should happen when they are touched—without also having to think about how all the information is stored inside the machine. Working with a high level language at a high level of abstraction allows them to think about the overall logic, without worrying about low level details.</p>
        <p>But someone in the design team for the phone does have to tell the phone’s camera-program how to translate pictures (or text or sound) into a form the memory can store, and how to generate the extra information that says how much data to retrieve for that picture, and that each byte of that data is to be interpreted as color information, not something else.</p>

        <p>(The lines in <em>italics</em> in the table represent fractions: 1/1000, 1/1000000, etc.)</p>
        <p>As we write this in 2017, it's common to have a terabyte disk drive on your desk. Web services deal with petabytes or exabytes of data. The fractional names are used to measure times in the computer, such as a nanosecond memory access time, or distances between wires on a chip, which are measured in nanometers.</p>
<!--<p>Exactly how much data fits on a terabyte disk? If it were a terabyte of main memory inside the computer, it would be 2<sup>40</sup>or 1,099,511,627,776 bytes (about 1.1 trillion). But disk drive manufacturers measure sizes in powers of ten, not powers of two, so a terabyte of <em>disk</em> is exactly one trillion bytes — 10% smaller than the same amount of memory.</p>

      <div id="hint-disks" class="collapse">
      <p>You're not the only one.</p>
      <p>To make things worse, some operating systems measure the capacity of a disk in powers of two, so what the manufacturer calls a 1TB disk will be displayed in file listings as 909.5GB.</p>
      <p>Yet another standards group, the International Electrotechnical Commission, has established a different set of prefixes for things measured in powers of two. Each of these is the first two letters of a metric prefix, followed by "bi" for binary. So, instead of "kilo" for 10<sup>3</sup>, we're supposed to say "kibi" for 2<sup>10</sup>. Similarly, "mega" (10<sup>6</sup>) becomes "mebi" (2<sup>20</sup>), "giga" becomes "gibi," and so on.  So the memory size generally called 4GB (gigabytes) should officially be called 4GiB (gibibytes).</p>
      <p>These names are starting to appear in operating system software, but so far, nobody actually uses them in conversation (other than our colleague, Berkeley Professor Dan Garcia, who's very into them). For example, if you look very closely at the memory boards pictured above, you'll see that each of them is labelled as 512MB, not 512MiB.</p>
