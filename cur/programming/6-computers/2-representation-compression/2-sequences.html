                <li>The color version of the project (<a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/6-computers/U6L1-TranslatingBinary_color.xml" target="_blank">U6L1-TranslatingBinary_color.xml</a>) breaks Snap<em>!</em> because of an unresolved bug (<a href="https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks/issues/1873" target="_blank">#1873</a>). Perhaps, we can get the B&amp;W version to work as a project, but we still need to resolve some issues with the sequence requiring a flag (e.g., "TEXT") at the front so it isn't treated as a number (if I recall correctly). I don't like the flag solution because it breaks the idea that text can be stored as ones and zeros if we have to include something that is not ones and zeros with it.</li>
                <li>The PHP script that I used to get the binary sequences for images is here: <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/utilities/colorreader.php" target="_blank">http://localhost/bjc-r/utilities/colorreader.php</a>. Edit the $im variable initialization (currently line 9) to change the path of the color file exported into a binary sequence, and edit the $imbw initialization (currently line 59) to change the B&amp;W file. It would be amazing to incorporate this into the project, but that would require being able to handle uploaded images or images with an existing URL, and I haven't thought through that possibility yet. --MF, 11/30/17</li>

        <p>So far we've been working with small chunks of data, from Boolean values (one bit) to characters (eight bits). But of course some information in your computer or smartphone is much bigger than that.</p>
        <div class="todo">We've hardly said anything about characters yet! Is this where you wanted to include something about Unicode? Something needs to change here... --MF, 12/6/17</div>
		
        <div class="commentBig">AC:  Say a bit more here:  each character is a byte? Give an example.<br />
        Oy. One character is one byte if you're an English speaker (and not a mathematician). Otherwise it gets more complicated. Hoping to avoid that here. --bh</div><p>For starters, characters aren't generally used one at a time; they're used in <em>text strings</em> such as "<code>Welcome to the Beauty and Joy of Computing.</code>" These 43 characters occupy 43 bytes of computer memory. (In many programming languages there's a convention that every text string ends with a <em>null</em> byte, in which all eight bits are zero, a code that's reserved for this purpose. So our string might actually occupy 44 bytes.)</p>
        <p>But the real champion users of space are media files: pictures, sounds (mostly music), and video. For example, the spinning disk drive picture above takes up about 16Mb — 16 million bytes.</p>
<!--        <p>When we write, we often symbolize <em>off</em> as 0 and <em>on</em> as 1, but the memory is not storing zeros and ones. Bits are electric signals; they are either <em>on</em> or <em>off</em>. When we test a bit to see if it's on, the test returns a Boolean value: if the bit is <em>on</em>, it returns <code>true</code>; otherwise, it returns <code>false</code>.</p>
       
   <div class="endnote">
        	 That's why this happens:<br />
            <p class="center"><img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/true+true=2.png" alt="true + true = 2" title="true + true = 2"/></p>
        </div>
        <p>We also use 1 and 0 and in place of <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> as a convenient shorthand. -->
        <p>If we could see inside the memory’s bits and we wrote it as zeros and ones, a section of the memory might look something like this:</p>

         <h3>Binary Sequences in Context</h3>
<p>Here's the binary representation of 20! in 64-bit integer format:</p>
<p>0010000111000011011001110111110001000010101101000000000000000000</p>
<p>As an integer, that pattern of bits represents 243290200817664000. But <em>that same pattern of bits</em> represents</p>
<p>4.85611351839403586987046017196×10<sup>-146</sup></p>
<p>when considered as a floating point representation. The same pattern of bits may <em>also</em> represent an instruction in the machine language of whatever computer you're using. This is so important we're going to say it in boldface: <span style="background-color: #fcc589"><strong>The meaning of a sequence of bits depends on the context in which it is used.</strong></span> That's the take-away understanding you should get from this page, after you've forgotten details such as how many bits there are in a word.</p>
<p>What exactly do we mean by &quot;context&quot;? How does a programming language know whether to interpret a bit sequence as an integer, a float, a string of characters, an instruction, or something else? There's always <em>another</em> bit sequence somewhere that encodes the <strong>data type</strong> of the bit sequence.</p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <a href="#hint-data-types" data-toggle="collapse">But different languages use data types differently.</a>
      <div id="hint-data-types" class="collapse">
<p>In great languages, that data type code is attached to the value itself. In ordinary languages, when you make a variable, you have to say what type of value it will contain, and the data type is attached to the <em>variable</em>, so you can't get exact answers when the values are integers and also be able to handle non-integer values of the same variable. So instead of seeing</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/varfoo.png" alt="script variables (foo)"></p>
<p>you see things like</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/intfoo.png" alt="integer (foo)"></p>
<p>We're telling you all these things because Snap<em>!</em> has strengths that many  programming languages do not, and it's very likely that your <em>next</em> year's computer science class will use one of those other languages. For example, if you take the AP Computer Science A course, it will use Java.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="takeNote">All through this page we've been talking about numbers, but don't forget that, at the lowest level of software abstraction, <em>everything</em>

in a computer is represented as a binary sequence. A Boolean value is a single bit, 0 for <code>false</code> and 1 for <code>true</code>.
 A character string is a sequence of Unicode character codes, each of which is a small integer&mdash;
	a sequence of bits. Lists and procedures, too, are binary sequences, but the precise format is beyond the scope of this course.</div>
    
    </div>
		<p>So if pictures, music, and words all look the same in memory—all binary sequences—how can the computer tell what any chunk of memory actually is? For example, should the sequence 01000001 be interpreted as the number 65, the letter A, a rather dark shade of red, or something else?</p>
        
        <div class="todo">
        	I'm assuming that the next three paragraphs are meant to satisfy some requirement, but it's not clear to me what EKs are involved.  For example, does the discussion of high level languages in the second paragraph below give us something not in the earlier discussion on 6.1.3? -bh<br />
        	Reads like Paul, so it's probably here for a reason ---AC
        <p>When your phone’s camera stores a picture in memory, your phone translates that picture, pixel by pixel, into a long binary sequence and then adds extra information (also a binary sequence) saying how how many bytes to read in order to reproduce the whole picture, and how those bytes are to be interpreted. In the case of a picture, bytes are interpreted as shades of a color. If the information stored is the name of the state capital, each byte might be interpreted as a letter.</p>
        <p>Many designers are involved in building a device like the smart phone. Some work with high level languages (like Snap<em>!</em>) that let them specify how things should work—like where icons or buttons should appear on the screen and what should happen when they are touched—without also having to think about how all the information is stored inside the machine. Working with a high level language at a high level of abstraction allows them to think about the overall logic, without worrying about low level details.</p>
        <p>But someone in the design team for the phone does have to tell the phone’s camera-program how to translate pictures (or text or sound) into a form the memory can store, and how to generate the extra information that says how much data to retrieve for that picture, and that each byte of that data is to be interpreted as color information, not something else.</p>

    <!--<p>Exactly how much data fits on a terabyte disk? If it were a terabyte of main memory inside the computer, it would be 2<sup>40</sup>or 1,099,511,627,776 bytes (about 1.1 trillion). But disk drive manufacturers measure sizes in powers of ten, not powers of two, so a terabyte of <em>disk</em> is exactly one trillion bytes — 10% smaller than the same amount of memory.</p>

      <p>You're not the only one.</p>
      <p>To make things worse, some operating systems measure the capacity of a disk in powers of two, so what the manufacturer calls a 1TB disk will be displayed in file listings as 909.5GB.</p>
      <p>Yet another standards group, the International Electrotechnical Commission, has established a different set of prefixes for things measured in powers of two. Each of these is the first two letters of a metric prefix, followed by "bi" for binary. So, instead of "kilo" for 10<sup>3</sup>, we're supposed to say "kibi" for 2<sup>10</sup>. Similarly, "mega" (10<sup>6</sup>) becomes "mebi" (2<sup>20</sup>), "giga" becomes "gibi," and so on.  So the memory size generally called 4GB (gigabytes) should officially be called 4GiB (gibibytes).</p>
      <p>These names are starting to appear in operating system software, but so far, nobody actually uses them in conversation (other than our colleague, Berkeley Professor Dan Garcia, who's very into them). For example, if you look very closely at the memory boards pictured above, you'll see that each of them is labelled as 512MB, not 512MiB.</p>

                	Look inside the <code>translate text to binary sequence</code> and <code>translate binary sequence to text</code> reporters. <strong>Describe how these two reporters work.</strong> There are several custom blocks inside:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>pack 8-bit byte</code> takes a binary sequence of 8 vits or less and add enough zeros to the front to make a whole byte. How is this used?</li>
                        <li><code>translate decimal to binary</code> takes a decimal value (a normal number) as input and translates it to the binary representation of that number. This block uses recursion. Why is recursion helpful here?</li>
                        <li><code>translate text to unicode list</code> takes a text string and outputs a list of each charcter's unicode value. Why is a list output helpful here?</li>
                    </ul>
    			</li>
			</ol>
