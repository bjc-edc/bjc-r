            In case someone wants to do more with the project one day:
            <ul>
                <li>The color version of the project (<a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/6-computers/U6L1-TranslatingBinary_color.xml" target="_blank">U6L1-TranslatingBinary_color.xml</a>) breaks Snap<em>!</em> because of an unresolved bug (<a href="https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks/issues/1873" target="_blank">#1873</a>). </li>
                <li>The PHP script that I used to get the binary sequences for images is here: <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/utilities/colorreader.php" target="_blank">http://localhost/bjc-r/utilities/colorreader.php</a>. Edit the $im variable initialization (currently line 9) to change the path of the color file exported into a binary sequence, and edit the $imbw initialization (currently line 59) to change the B&amp;W file. It would be amazing to incorporate this into the project, but that would require being able to handle uploaded images or images with an existing URL, and I haven't thought through that possibility yet. --MF, 11/30/17</li>

            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn more about how information is represented inside the computer as sequences of bits.</p>
		</div>
		
        <div class="sidenote">In many programming languages there's a convention that every text string ends with a <em>null</em> byte, in which all eight bits are zero, a code that's reserved for this purpose. So our "<code>Welcome...</code>" string might actually occupy 44 bytes.</div>
        <p>So far we've been working with small chunks of data, from Boolean values (one bit) to characters (eight bits). But of course some information in your computer or smartphone is much bigger than that. For starters, characters aren't generally used one at a time; they're used in <em>text strings</em> such as "<code>Welcome to the Beauty and Joy of Computing.</code>" These 43 characters occupy 43 bytes of computer memory. But the real champion users of space are media files: pictures, sounds (mostly music), and video.</p>
        <p>If we could see inside the memory’s bits, a section of the memory might look something like this:</p>

            <p>So if pictures, music, and words all look the same in memory—all binary sequences—how can the computer tell what any chunk of memory actually is? For example, should the sequence 01000001 be interpreted as the number 65, the letter A, a rather dark shade of red, or something else?</p>
            <p>The meaning of a sequence of bits depends on the context in which it is used. What exactly do we mean by "context"? How does a programming language know whether to interpret a bit sequence as an integer, a picture, a string of characters, an instruction, or something else? There's always <em>another</em> bit sequence somewhere that encodes the <strong>data type</strong> of the bit sequence.</p>

                    In high-level languages, that data type code is attached to the value itself. In lower-level languages, when you make a variable, you have to say what type of value it will contain, and the data type is attached to the <em>variable</em>, so you can't get exact answers when the values are integers and also be able to handle non-integer values of the same variable. So instead of seeing: <br />
