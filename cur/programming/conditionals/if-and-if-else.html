	    Now that we have the idea of predicates under our belt, we can finally express full "if-then" statements,
	    such as "if the weather is nice, you should go outside." This can be expressed
	    in <span class='snap'>snap</span> using the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if.png" alt="if"/>
	    block. Notice how the first slot is shaped just like a predicate block. <code>if</code> blocks only know how
	    to handle yes/no questions, so you should only ever put predicate blocks into this slot. The C-shaped part
	    of the <code>if</code> block is where you put the commands that should be run if the condition is
	    true. Let's take a look at an example:
	</p>

	<p>
	    <img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/mood.png"/>
	</p>

	<p>
	    In the above example, we had several possible cases to consider. However, in many situations, there are only
	    two main cases. Take for example, the following sentence: "If a number is divisible by 2, it is
	    even. Otherwise it is odd." For these situations we have the <img class="inline"
	    src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if-else.png" alt="if-else"/> block. It works like this:
	</p>

	<p>
	    <img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/even-or-odd.png"/>
	</p>

	<p>
	    Here, we didn't need to have an additional "if," because all whole numbers are either even or odd. If the
	    boolean expression (<code>x mod 2 = 0</code>) evaluates to <code>false</code>, we know that the number is not even and
	    thus must be odd.
	</p>
	<p class="quoteorange">
	    If you haven't seen the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mod.png" alt="() mod ()"/> block before,
	    it reports the remainder (or "modulus") when the first input is divided by the second. For example, <code>5
	    mod 2</code> reports <code>1</code> because <code>5 / 2 = 2 remainder 1</code>. This block is especially
	    useful for checking whether a number is divisible by another, because the remainder will be
	    0. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/x-mod-2-equals-0.png" alt="(x mod 2) = 0"/> is the same as
	    asking if <code>x</code> is divisible by 2 (i.e. that <code>x</code> is even).
