	    We are going to assume that you are comfortable with how the code provided in the previous
	    section works. Here's the script again:

	    <br>
	    Here are six challenges to try to make the code act more like a human. If you think of anything
	    else that would make it cooler, feel free to add it in. Try each of these in order. When you are
	    done, your finished code should be able to deal with <em>all</em> of the challenges.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    <strong>Challenge #1</strong>: The sprite should welcome the player and ask for their name
	    before beginning.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    <strong>Challenge #2</strong>: If they guess incorrectly, the sprite should tell them that they
	    are incorrect, using their name. For example, if Colleen is playing the game, the sprite should
	    say something like <code>Sorry Colleen, that is not the right answer.</code> before asking them to
	    guess again.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    <strong>Challenge #3</strong>: If they guess incorrectly, the sprite should tell them if the
	    secret number is bigger or smaller than the number that they guessed.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    <strong>Challenge #4</strong>: Right now, the script always picks a number between <code>1</code>
	    and <code>10</code>. Change this so that it picks a number between <code>1</code> and a variable
	    named <code>maximum</code>. Ask the player what they would like the maximum number to be, before
	    choosing a random number. Use this maximum number as the highest number that the script will
	    choose.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    <strong>Challenge #5</strong>: Keep track of how many guesses it takes before the player guesses
	    the right number.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    <strong>Challenge #6</strong>: When the player guesses the secret number, tell them how many
	    guesses it took, and congratulate them using their name.
