        In the code sample below, we have implemented a simple number-guessing game.  The computer chooses a random
        number and then asks the player to guess the random number.  The code is available in <a class="run"
        href="/bjc-r/prog/conditionals/guess-number.xml">this file</a>.

        <br>
        <br>

        The game is not that cool yet, though.  In the next few steps, we are going to make the game much more like
        playing the number-guessing game with a person!
