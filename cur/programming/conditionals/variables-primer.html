       <p>
	   Before we jump into the main topic of today's lab, we need to briefly discuss variables. Much like in math,
	   variables are used to keep track of values. You've already seen two special kinds of variables, in the
	   previous lab: block (or function) parameters and <code>for</code> loop counters. Recall that when you have a block with
	   input <code>x</code>, <code>x</code> will store whatever value the user passed in when they ran the block. In a <code>for</code> loop, the
	   counter (by default, called <code>i</code>) increases every time the loop is run. These two special variables share an
	   important feature: their values are not explicitly set and changed by the programmer - the computer does the
	   work for us. However, it is often useful for us to be able to use variables for our own purposes. For
	   example, if we were creating a game, it might be useful for us to keep track of the user's lives and
	   score. We'll use variables to accomplish this task. Let's see how.
       </p>

       <p>
	   Variables can be created in two ways. The recommended way to create variables is using the script variables
	   block, which can be found at the top of the orange "variables" tab.
       </p>
	   
       <img src="/bjc-r/img/variables/variables-tab.png" alt="top of the variables tab"/>
       <p>
	   This block creates variables
	   that will last until the end of the current script. Most variables we create are meant to be temporary, so we
	   like this feature. To create more than one script variable at a time, click the arrow on the right side of
	   the script variables block. You can change the names of script variables by clicking on their names. The
	   other way to create variables is by clicking the "Make a variable" button at the top of the "variables"
	   tab. These variables are called "global" because they can be accessed by any script at any time. Generally,
	   creating too many of these variables is risky, and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
       </p>

       <p>
	   Now that we know how to create variables, how do we use them? To set the value of variables, use the
	   <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set.png" alt="set (_) to (_)"/> block. This block stores the value on the right
	   in the variable specified. To access this value, use the rounded variable block
	   (i.e. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png" alt="(i)"/>). Here's a quick example:
       </p>
     
       <p>
	   <img src="/bjc-r/img/variables/player-lives.png" alt="set lives to 5; say (join words ('Hello, player! You
	   have) (lives) ('lives remaining'))"/>
       </p>

       <p>
	   (note that the <code>join words</code> block allows you to combine multiple strings of text into one. If it's
	   not already in your project, you need to click <img class="inline"
	   src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/topic1_filesaveicon.png" alt="page icon"/> and then select "import tools")
       </p>
