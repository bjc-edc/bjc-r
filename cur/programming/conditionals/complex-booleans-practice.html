	   Now we're going to write some blocks that utilize predicates like <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>,
	   and <code>not</code>.
       </p>

       <ul>
	   <li>
	       Write a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/weekend.png" alt="weekend (_)"/> block that reports
	       whether a given day is a weekend. Let's assume that only Saturday and Sunday are part of the weekend.
	   </li>
	   <li>
	       Write a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/weekday.png" alt="weekday (_)"/> block. You could write
	       this with or without your <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/weekend.png" alt="weekend (_)"/>
	       block, but it'll be much easier if you do.
	   </li>
	   <li>
	       Here is a block definition. Give it a more descriptive name, then re-write using no <code>if</code>
	       blocks.
	       <p>
		   <img src="/bjc-r/img/cond/mystery.png"/>
	       </p>
	   </li>
       </ul>
