	    Below are several blocks that use if and if-else. Predict what each one will do and discuss it with your
	    neighbor. Once you've done so, you try running each of the blocks, which can be found <a class="run"
	    href="/bjc-r/prog/conditionals/predict-if-functions.xml">here</a>.

	    You'll notice that a couple of the scripts below use the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/abs.png"
	    alt="abs ()"/> block. This block actually allows you to use many different mathematical functions. It shows
	    up in the palette as <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/sqrt-of-10.png" alt="sqrt (10)"/>. Just
	    click the drop-down menu to select which function to use. "abs" is short for "absolute value." In case
	    you're not already familiar, the absolute value of a number is just that number turned positive. For
	    example, <code>abs(10)</code> is just <code>10</code>, while <code>abs(-2.5)</code> is <code>2.5</code>.
