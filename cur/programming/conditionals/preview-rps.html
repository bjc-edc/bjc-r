<p>We want two characters to be able to play the game of <em>Rock, Paper, Scissors</em> against each other.  We will do this by making a variable for each  character that stores a number.  They store a random number between 1 and 3 into this variable.  Based on this number, they say the corresponding word.  An example run of the code is shown below:

<form id="form1" name="form1" method="post" action="http:preview-rps-soln.html">
  <p>1. Based on the diagram above, what does the character say if their choice is 1?
    <input type="text" name="textfield" id="textfield" />
  </p>
  <p>2. Based on the diagram above, what does the character say if their choice is 2?
    <input type="text" name="textfield2" id="textfield2" />
  </p>
  <p>3. Based on the diagram above, what does the character say if their choice is 3?
    <input type="text" name="textfield3" id="textfield3" />
  </p>
