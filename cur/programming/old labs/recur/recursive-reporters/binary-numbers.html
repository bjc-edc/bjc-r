	<p>If there's one thing everyone knows about computers, it's that they think in zeros and ones. As you know by now, the whole point of computer science is <em>abstraction, </em>so that you can program and use computers without ever having to deal with their low-level circuitry. Still, for some reason the people who made up the AP curriculum standards think you should know about binary.</p>
	<div class="advancednote"><p>People usually say "binary numbers," but the mathematicians on our team won't let us do that.  Numbers are numbers, regardless of how they're represented: "XVIII" and "18" represent the same number, and so, as you'll see, does "10010" in binary.</p></div>
    
	<p>In plain old decimal (base 10) notation, each digit's <em>position </em>represents a power of 10, starting with 1 (which is 10<sup>0</sup>)
	    on the right, and multiplying by 10 as you move left.  So, for example, 9827 is, <em>from right to left,</em></p>
	<p align="center">7 &times;  10<sup>0</sup> + 2 &times;  10<sup>1</sup> + 8 &times;  10<sup>2</sup> + 9 &times;  10<sup>3</sup></p>
    <p align="left">(Why right to left?  Because the rightmost digit is always multiplied by 10<sup>0</sup>, but in a long number such as 432786149314152718281828459045 you can't tell what power of 10 to multiply the leftmost digit by, until you count from the right.)</p>
	<p align="left">Binary uses the same positional idea, but with powers of two instead of powers of ten.  So 10010 binary represents, from right to left,</p>
    <p align="center">0 &times; 2<sup>0</sup> + 1 &times; 2<sup>1</sup> + 0 &times; 2<sup>2</sup> + 0 &times; 2<sup>3</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>4</sup> = 2 + 16 = 18 decimal.</p>
	<p align="left">Our goal is to write a reporter <code>decimal-&gt;binary</code> that takes a <em>number</em> (which Snap<em>!</em> represents in decimal) as input, and reports a <em>string of zeros and ones</em> that represent the same number in binary:</p>
<div><div class="sidenote">    <p align="left">(Snap<em>!</em> blurs the distinction between a number and a string of digits, allowing you to use text operators on numbers and arithmetic operators on strings of digits.  But for right now, don't do that; it'll be less confusing if you do arithmetic on the input, but combine the digits of the reported result using <code>join</code>.)</p></div></div>

	<p align="left">To solve this problem, you're going to have to know how to do integer division the way you did it in third grade, before you knew about fractions: 17 ÷ 5 is <strong>3 remainder 2</strong>. Here's how to do that in Snap<em>!</em>&thinsp;:</p>
	<p align="left"><img src="/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/quotient.png" alt="quotient" /><img src="/bjc-r/img/recur/reporters/mod.png" alt="mod" /></p>
	<p align="left">In the Operators palette there's a block <code>sqrt of</code> in which the word <code>sqrt</code> is part of a menu of mathematical operations. From that menu, choose <code>floor</code> to get the integer part of the quotient. (It's called &quot;floor&quot; because it's the nearest integer <em>smaller than </em>its input, as opposed to <code>round</code>, which finds the nearest integer whether smaller or larger.) &quot;Mod&quot; is short for <em>modulo, </em>which is the fancy mathematical name for remainder.</p>
