        <div class="comment">Build a script with sound that does what this paragraph says...</div>
        <p>Blocks in a script run in a specific order, from the top of the script to the bottom. Generally, <span class="snap">snap</span> waits until one block has finished its job before continuing on to the block below it. (One common exception is blocks that play sounds: a block's job can be to <em>start</em> the sound, which means the block below it will execute while the sound is still playing.)</p>
