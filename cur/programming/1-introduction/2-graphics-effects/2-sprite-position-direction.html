					Your stage should look like this. The picture below shows the stage with axes and a grid. The background also shows the coordinates of the four points on the axes that are farthest from the origin but still visible on the stage.

					Assemble a collection of blocks from the "Motion" and "Pen" tabs into a script that, with one click, draws a square or triangle or some other a simple picture. You will almost certainly want at least these blocks:<br />

					<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/turn-right-15.png" class="block" alt="Turn Right 15 Degrees Block"/>&nbsp;

					and <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pen-down.png" class="block" alt="Pen Up Block"/>.

					This script was intended to create a pentagon, but it has bugs. Without building it, try to figure out what it does instead. Then build it and try it out. What change(s) would fix this script?<br/>

		<div class="comment">These are each useful elsewhere: 1) on explore this code or the snap interface 2) this the watchers stuff whereever that all falls 3) as a sidenote with somthing on this page...</div>
		<div>
			Useful notes:
			<ul>
				<li>Once the pen is down, it stays down even in a different script. If you want your script to move the sprite  without leaving a trace, use the <code>pen up</code> block to &quot;lift the pen.&quot; </li>
				<li>If you want, you can use <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-getting-started/reporters.html"><em>watchers</em></a> to show the direction of the sprite or its <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates.</li>
				<li> Coordinate systems for computer screens do not all work the way we expect in algebra, but <span class="snap">snap</span>&rsquo;  does. <em>Unlike</em> the common mathematical convention, the numbers naming <em>direction</em> start with 0 at the top ("north") and count degrees going clockwise. The black sprite above is pointing to the "east," so its direction is 90. <br />

        <h2>Watchers<a name="watchers" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h2>
		<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/position-watchers.gif" alt="" title="" />
        <p>The three oval-shaped <strong>reporters</strong> at the bottom of the Motion palette have checkboxes for <strong>watchers</strong>.  Unlike the jigsaw-puzzle-shaped <strong>command</strong> blocks, reporters don't carry out an action (such as moving the sprite  or displaying a speech balloon).  Instead, they <em>report a value</em>, usually for use in another block's input slot.</p>
        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/watchers-on-stage.gif" alt="position and direction watchers on the stage" title="position and direction watchers on the stage" />
        <p>If you click the reporters, they will tell you their value (in this case, who the sprite is positioned on the stage). If you check off the boxes next to them, their values will be displayed in a <strong>watcher</strong> on the stage. As in algebra, <em>x</em> means left-to-right position, and <em>y</em> means bottom-to-top position.</p>
        <p>There are reporters with checkboxes for watchers in several of the <span class="snap">snap</span> palettes.

			  	<li>Click on the sprite on the stage, and drag it a bit to the right of the center of the stage.</li>
				<li> Drag an <code>x position</code> block into the scripting area and click on it.  You should see a  speech balloon next to the block:<br />
					<img src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/xpos-bubble.png" alt="X Position speech balloon"/>
				</li>
			  	<li>Now, drag the sprite to some new location on the stage and click on the <code>x position</code> block again.</li>
			  	<li> You can create a <strong>watcher</strong> that sits on the stage and constantly displays the <em>x</em>-position of the sprite. In the palette, click on the gray box to the left of the <code>x position</code> block. Now drag the sprite around and see what that watcher says.

					<div class="todo">JK: Teachers at the EDC BJC day had trouble with them. They suggested an animated gif to show this process rather than the two images here. They also didn't read the problem so they really didn't understand (these teachers kept not reading. But if teachers don't read, then students won't read.). I think they were confused because the first sentence explains what the watcher is, so they expected to have already known what the watcher is - maybe this is a matter of just switching the order of the sentences so that the first sentence is last.</div>
				</li>
				<li>Create watchers for <code>y position</code> and <code>direction</code>. Move the sprite around, using commands or just by dragging it with your mouse. Notice which values change and  which values <em>don't</em>.</li>
