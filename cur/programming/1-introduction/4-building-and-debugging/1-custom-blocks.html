        	<li>JK: Teachers at the EDC PD day wanted an animation on this page. They got stuck on these instructions. (They also really didn't like to read.)</li>

            <li>MF: consider adding building this block with a list input to preview U3:<br /> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/favorite-food.png" alt="favorite food 'foods': for each (item) of (foods) [say (join (I like, 'item', a lot!!)) for 2 secs]" title="favorite food 'foods': for each (item) of (foods) [say (join (I like, 'item', a lot!!)) for 2 secs]" /><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/favorite-food-list.png" alt="favorite food [list: apples, bananas, oranges, grapes, peaches]" title="favorite food [list: apples, bananas, oranges, grapes, peaches]" /></li>

          <p>Up until now, you used blocks that already existed. You will now learn how to build your own blocks. You will start by making a block that draws a square and you will name this new block <code>draw square</code>. </p>
          <p>To start, right-click (or control-click on a Mac) on the gray background of the scripting area and choose &quot;make a block.&quot; The video below shows how to start building a <code>draw square</code> block. <div class="sidenote">To get the Block Editor, you can also click <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/make-a-block.png" alt="Make a block" title="Make a block" /> near the bottom of the "Variables" palette.</div> </p>
</div>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
          <ol>
                <li>Start building the <code>draw square</code> block as the video shows. Then finish the block yourself and press OK. The step-by-step instructions  in the yellow section below give you more detail about what you are doing. They are worth reading.</li></ol></div>
                
                <div class="endnote">
                Every block needs a palette (color), a title, a category (shape), and a script that defines its behavior.
                	  <ol>
                    	<li> 
                       		<strong>Palette:</strong> Choose a  palette for your new block to go into. ("Motion" or "Pen" might be nice for the <code>draw square</code> block.<br />
                    		
                            <img  alt="'make a block' dialog box" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/make-a-block-BYOB.png" >
                            <div class="takeNote">You can put the new block in any palette that makes sense to you. If you don't choose a palette/color, your block will be a gray "Other" block and will be sorted into the "Variables" tab.</div>
                		</li>
                   		<div class="manual">You can find more in the <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/help/SnapManual.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Snap Manual pages 17-18</a>.</div>
                        <li> 
                        	<strong>Title:</strong> Give your block a name. Type "draw square" as shown here.<br />
                    		<img  alt="Make a command block" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/make-draw-square-block.png" >
                    	</li>
                        <li><strong>Category:</strong> Leave "Command" selected since we want a block that takes action (drawing a square) rather than one that reports a value.
                          <div class="takeNote">
                            You've seen commands before and also reporters, which report information, like this:
                            <p class="center">

                        </li>
                        
                  		<li>
                        	In this course, you will almost always want to keep "for all sprites" selected, so you can ignore that choice for now, and click "OK". </li>
                        <li>A dialog titled "Block Editor" will appear.<br />
    					    <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/empty-draw-square-BYOB.png" alt="Block Editor for 'draw square'" >
        					<div class="takeNote">The editor starts you with a <strong>hat</strong> block, a kind of block that is the start for any block you create. It contains the title of your block, <code>draw square</code>, in this case. Hat blocks can never be in the middle of a script, only at the top.</div>
                        </li>
        				<li>
                			<strong>Behavior:</strong> Build the instructions for your new block here exactly as you do in the scripting area:  <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-drawing-communication/1-exploring-snap-drawing-motion.html#building">Drag blocks from the palette</a> to define the script that will run when your custom block is used. <br />

                        </li>
                        <li>When you click "OK", you can use this block exactly the way you have used other blocks. Since you created the block as a "Motion" block, you will find it in the "Motion" tab. <p>
        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pen-down-draw-square.png" alt="pen down, draw square" title="pen down, draw square" /></p>
        <p>Congratulations! You have just created your first custom block.</p></li>
