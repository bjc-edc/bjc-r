        <h2>Designing Custom Blocks</h2>
        
        <p>
        	Up until now, you used blocks that already existed. You will now learn how to build your own blocks. You will start by making a block that draws a square and you will name this new block <code>draw square</code>.<br/>
        	<img class="indent" alt="Script to draw a square" src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/draw-square-no-arguments.png" >
        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<ol>
            	<li>
                	Build the <code>draw square</code> block. To start, right-click (or control-click on a Mac) on the gray background of the scripting area and choose "make a block..." The video below shows how to start building the block. Finish it yourself, and press OK. The step-by-step instructions  in the yellow section below give you more detail about what you are doing.
                	<div class="sidenote">To get the Block Editor, you can also click <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/make-a-block.png" alt="Make a block" title="Make a block" /> near the bottom of the "Variables" palette.</div>
                	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/make-a-square-block.gif" alt="make a block">
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
                
        <div class="endnote">
            Every block needs a palette (color), a title, a category (shape), and a script that defines its behavior.
			<ul>
				<li> 
                    <strong>Palette:</strong> Choose a  palette for your new block to go into. ("Motion" or "Pen" might be nice for the <code>draw square</code> block.)<br />
                    <img  alt="'make a block' dialog box" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/make-a-block-BYOB.png" >
                    <div class="sideHOMbig">You can put the new block in any palette that makes sense to you. If you don't choose a palette/color, your block will be a gray "Other" block and will be sorted into the "Variables" tab.</div>
                </li>
                <div class="manual">You can find information more in the <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/help/SnapManual.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">Snap Manual pages 17-18</a>.</div>
                <li> 
                    <strong>Title:</strong> Give your block a name. Type "draw square" as shown here.<br />
                    <img  alt="Make a command block" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/make-draw-square-block.png" >
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Category:</strong> Leave "Command" selected since we want a block that takes action (drawing a square) rather than one that reports a value. 
                  <!--<div class="takeNote">
                    You've seen commands before and also reporters, which report information, like this:
                    <p class="center">
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/x-position-reporting--79.png" alt="x position reporting -79" title="x position reporting -79" />
                    <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/sqrt-of-25-reporting-5.png" alt="Sqrt of 25 reporting 5" title="Sqrt of 25 reporting 5" />
                    </p>
                    
                </div>-->
                	(In this course, you will almost always want to keep "for all sprites" selected, so you can ignore that choice for now, and click "OK".)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Behavior:</strong> A dialog titled "Block Editor" will appear. Build the instructions for your new block here exactly as you do in the scripting area:  <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-drawing-communication/1-exploring-snap-drawing-motion.html#building">Drag blocks from the palette</a> to define the script that will run when your custom block is used. When you are finished, click "OK".<br />
                    <div class="sideHOM">The editor starts you with a <strong>hat</strong> block, a kind of block that is the start for any block you create. It contains the title of your block, which is <code>draw square</code> in this case. Hat blocks can never be in the middle of a script, only at the top. </div>
                    <img class="indent" alt="Script to draw a square" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/empty-draw-square.png" >
                </li>
			</ul>
		</div>
        
        <p>You can use the <code>draw square</code> block exactly the way you have used other blocks. If you created the block as a blue Motion block, you will find it in the Motion palette. <p>
        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pen-down-draw-square.png" alt="pen down, draw square" title="pen down, draw square" /></p>
        <p>Congratulations! You have just created your first custom block.</p></p>
    
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <p>Practice building blocks.</p>
            <ol start = "2">
                <li>Define <code>draw triangle</code> to draw an equilateral triangle with the same side-length as the square you just drew. </li>
                <li>Define <code>MyNameBackwards</code>. When clicked, it should spell your name backwards. (Your related work from the previous page should be saved in "U1L2-ForLoops"; you can drag an entire script from the scripting area into the block editor.) </li>
