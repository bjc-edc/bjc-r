            	<li><strong>Paul</strong>, can you drop in some ideas of scripts to debug? Here are some debugging prompts from the TG: <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/Week01/W01-activities.html" target="_blank">W1</a> and <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/Week01/W01-activities.html" target="_blank">W2</a>. --Mary</li>

    	<p>Programming is complicated. When people make mistakes in conversation, others might be able to understand what they mean anyway; but when people make mistakes in programming, computers (which aren't yet intelligent, but might be one day) might just report an error. Programmers call errors in their code "bugs",  parts of the program that don't do what the programmer intended (or that cause some other part of the program not to behave as intended). The process of finding and fixing bugs is called "debugging."</p>

        	Debugging can be a pain. Here are some tips for writing code without (or with fewer) bugs:
        	<ol>
            	<li><strong>Start Small</strong>: Build one (small) part of your program and get it working right before moving on to the next piece.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep it Working</strong>: When you build the next piece, get that new piece working before you move on again.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>This approach is nice because you won't have a huge mess with many bugs to sort out and you'll have something that works to share with your teacher and other programmers at every step of the way.</p>
