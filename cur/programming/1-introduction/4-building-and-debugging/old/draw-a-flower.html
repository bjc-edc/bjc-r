    	<h2>Compose a <code>Draw a Flower</code> Block</h2>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<ol>
            	<li>
                	<p>Write a block that draws a full flower in the middle of the stage.</p>
       			 	<img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/draw-a-flower.png" alt="draw a flower block">
                    <p>Write simple custom blocks, or borrow from blocks you have already written, and then use those blocks inside your <code>draw a flower</code> block.  If you can, write blocks of intermediate complexity that use and are used by other blocks you write.</p>
            		<p>
                    	You might write:
                    	<ul>
                        	<li><code>draw flower head with ...</code></li>
                            <li><code>draw stem with length []</code></li>
                        </ul>
                        but don't feel constrained by this list.
                    </p>
                    <p>Use several inputs that control aspects of what the flower should look like.  You might change the number of petals...</p>
                </li>
                <li>After you've worked on this for a bit, take a moment to look at what other students have done and chat.  If you see something nice, spend some time trying to incorporate that design into your program.</li>
            </ol>
