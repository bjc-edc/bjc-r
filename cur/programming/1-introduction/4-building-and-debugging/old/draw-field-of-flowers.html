    	<h2>Draw a Field of Flowers</h2>
        <p>It's the end of the unit, so it's time to go a bit wild!</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<ol>
            	<li>
                	<p>Draw a field of flowers, and give each flower a different color, size, shape, position, and so forth.</p>
					<p>Use some of the simple custom blocks you've already written, and write new custom blocks that make use of those simpler blocks to do complicated things.</p>
                    <p>Use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="repeat block"> to draw lots of flowers, flowers with lots of petals, and so forth.</p>
            		<p>Use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-args.png" alt="pick random block"> as much as you can to make the flowers interesting and different.</p>
                    <p>Here is a custom block (from someone who went wild) to give you some ideas:</p>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/crazy-draw-flower-block.png" alt="crazy complicated draw flower block with tons of inputs">
                    <p>And, you could use <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/drawing/draw-field-of-flowers-with-backgrounds.xml">this starter project</a>, which contains a few fun backgrounds.  To use them, click on the "Stage" sprite at the lower right of the Snap<em>!</em> window, select the "Costumes" tab at the top of the scripting area, and select the background that you want for your program.</p>
