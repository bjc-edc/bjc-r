            <ul>
                <li>GitHub comment: In the "For You To Do" section it is unclear how one needs to incorportate the [draw square_] block into the [draw square-petal flower with_ petals of size_]. The image above this section I have drawn using [repeat 6] [turn 60 degrees] +[draw square] but it is unclear on how to create the new block that accepts inputs for the # of petals and the size of petals.</li>

        <p>You can treat your custom-made blocks like any other block in snap, including using them within other blocks you define. You've already done that at least once when you wrote <code>house</code>. </p>
        <p>In fact, the <em>best</em> way to solve bigger programming tasks is usually by writing simple blocks that are used within slightly more complicated blocks, which are in turn used in even more complicated blocks, and so on. When you build blocks made of other blocks you've built, this is called <strong>composition</strong> of blocks.</p>
        <p>You will practice this a bit more here, and we'll look more closely at this sort of composition of blocks later on, because it is an important idea in computer science.</p>

                <li>Use the <img class="block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/draw-square-empty-parameter.png"> block to create a block <img class="block" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-square-petal-flower-empty-parameters.png" alt="360 divided by the number of petals"> that will draw a  flower with square petals, like the one shown here, but with any specified number of square-shaped petals of the specified size.  Calling <img class="block" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-square-petal-flower-6-50-parameters.png" alt="block: draw a flower with 6 petals of size 50"> should draw the example picture above.</li>

                	<p>Write a block that draws a full flower in the middle of the stage.</p>

                    <p>Write simple custom blocks, or borrow from blocks you have already written, and then use those blocks inside your <code>draw a flower</code> block.  If you can, write blocks of intermediate complexity that use and are used by other blocks you write.</p>
            		<p>
                    	You might write:
                    	<ul>
                        	<li><code>draw flower head with ...</code></li>
                            <li><code>draw stem with length []</code></li>
                        </ul>
                        but don't feel constrained by this list.
                    </p>
                    <p>Use several inputs that control aspects of what the flower should look like.  You might change the number of petals...</p>
                </li>
                <li>After you've worked on this for a bit, take a moment to look at what other students have done and chat.  If you see something nice, spend some time trying to incorporate that design into your program.</li>

                	<p>Draw a field of flowers, and give each flower a different color, size, shape, position, and so forth.</p>
					<p>Use some of the simple custom blocks you've already written, and write new custom blocks that make use of those simpler blocks to do complicated things.</p>
                    <p>Use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="repeat block"> to draw lots of flowers, flowers with lots of petals, and so forth.</p>
            		<p>Use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-args.png" alt="pick random block"> as much as you can to make the flowers interesting and different.</p>
                    <p>Here is a custom block (from someone who went wild) to give you some ideas:</p>

                    <p>And, you could use <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/drawing/draw-field-of-flowers-with-backgrounds.xml">this starter project</a>, which contains a few fun backgrounds.  To use them, click on the "Stage" sprite at the lower right of the <span class="snap">snap</span> window, select the "Costumes" tab at the top of the scripting area, and select the background that you want for your program.</p>
