            <ul>
                <li>GitHub comment: In the "For You To Do" section it is unclear how one needs to incorporate the [draw square_] block into the [draw square-petal flower with_ petals of size_]. The image above this section I have drawn using [repeat 6] [turn 60 degrees] +[draw square] but it is unclear on how to create the new block that accepts inputs for the # of petals and the size of petals.</li>
                <li>GH: the blocks should have numeric input as an example</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 8/29/15: When I try to print the page, the blocks are HUGE and the text is tiny. So much so, I have to copy/paste into Word and edit before printing.<ul><li>Michael is working on it. --MF</li></ul></li>
                <li>GH Feedback 9/27/15: I think the "for you to do" #2 should be a purple "take it further" section</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>You can treat your custom-made blocks like any other block in snap, including using them within other blocks you define. You may have already done that at least once if you wrote <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/4-building-and-debugging/1-custom-blocks.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment#further">the <code>house</code> block</a>. </p>

                    <p>Write simple custom blocks, or borrow from blocks you have already written, and then use those blocks inside your <code>draw a flower</code> block.  If you can, write blocks of intermediate complexity that use and are used by other blocks you write.</p>
            		<p>
                    	You might write:
                    	<ul>

                        </ul>
                        but don't feel constrained by this list.
                    </p>
                    <p>Use several inputs that control aspects of what the flower should look like.  You might change the number of petals...</p>
