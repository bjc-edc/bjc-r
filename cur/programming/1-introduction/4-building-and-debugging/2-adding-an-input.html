		<h2>Giving Your Blocks Inputs</h2>
        <div class="sidenote">
        	You've seen many blocks that take inputs:<br />

        <p>Your <code>draw square</code> block draws squares of only one particular size&mdash;the size built into its script. You can improve your block to draw squares of <em>any</em> size by giving your block an <em><strong>input</strong></em>.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Edit your <code>draw square</code> block to give it an input. To edit a block, right-click on it  (or control-click or two-finger-click) and select "edit." Use the video to get the idea. You can read the detailed instructions (in yellow below) to learn more about what you are doing.<br />
				<div class="comment">This is the first time we've hinted that they might be using a touchscreen/touchpad.  We should maybe be consistent about this?  Define &quot;secondary click&quot; carefully once and then just use it? PG: This is getting overwhelmingly complicated and just begs to be obsolete when the next technology comes in. Right-click, control-click, two-finger-click....</div>

		<div class="endnote">
			<ul>
                <li> 
                	<strong>The + signs</strong>: In the Block Editor, hover your cursor over the words and plus signs (<b>+</b>) in the hat block. Clicking on a word lets you change the word; clicking on a <b>+</b> lets you put a new word in that position. Your new input will go after the title, so click the <b>+</b> at the end.<br />

                	<p>
                    	<strong>Naming the Input</strong>: Choose a name for the input that makes its meaning clear to any reader: <code>size</code> or <code>side length</code> would be good.  Type that name in the input field.

                    <p>
                    	You have two choices about how to treat that new text:
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Input name</strong> is automatically selected for you, and that is what you want now, so just leave it selected.</li>
                            <li>But <em>if</em> you ever want to change a block's title, you could click <strong>Title text</strong> (grey in this picture) and type the new words. (For example, to change the name from <code>draw square</code> to <code>draw square picture</code> you'd click on "Title text" and type the word "picture.")</li>
                                
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                    	Your block header has changed: there is now a variable named <code>size</code> (or whatever name you chose) after the title:<br />
