		<h2>Programming a Sprite to Follow a Motion</h2>
        <div class="todo">
        	<ul>
                <li>GH Feedback 9/10/15: I would like to suggest more questions on this page. It's great material, but not enough places for the kids to stop and think.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 10/24/15: Need more specific attention to the Sprite(2) script. We just start using it and students gloss over that this is a separate script for the second sprite.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>In this lab, you will program <em>two</em> sprites. One sprite will follow your mouse. The other sprite will chase the first. When they meet, they will have a short conversation.</p>

                <li>
                    Read and think about this script before you build it. What do you expect it to do?
                     
                    <p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/follow-that-mouse.png" alt="Follow That Mouse Script" title="Follow That Mouse Script" /></p>
                    <div class="endnote"><img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-x.png" class="inline" alt="Mouse X Reporter"/> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-y.png" class="inline" alt="Mouse Y Reporter"/> report the mouse's location on the stage. You can find them in the Sensing palette.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                	
					Now build the script and run it. Move your mouse around the stage while the program is running.
                    <div class="endnote">To <em>stop</em> this script, click the red stop sign <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="stop button"/>. </div>

                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Does the program work the way you expected?</li>
				<div class="sidenote">The animation below shows how to create a new sprite and give it its own script.</div>
                <li> Create a second sprite by clicking on the "add a new Turtle sprite" button just below the stage: <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/add-a-new-turtle-sprite.png" alt="add a new turtle sprite" title="add a new turtle sprite" />. <a name="newTurtle" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a> </li>
                <div class="endnote">The new sprite, named Sprite(2), appears on the stage. It's brand new so it has no scripts.  The buttons beneath the stage let you select the sprite you want to program.</div>
                <li>Give Sprite(2) its own script, one line of code that makes it point towards Sprite when the script is run.
                  <div class="todo">The project name in the animation doesn't match the name they're told to use.</div>

				<li> 
                	Change your script for Sprite(2) so that once the green flag is clicked, Sprite(2) will point towards Sprite forever.  <br />

	forever 
	  {
	     point towards (Sprite)

                <div class="endnote">While a script is running, its border lights up. If the running time is short, you may not notice the brief flash. </div>

                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Click <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="green-flag button"/> and check that your script does what you intended:

                            <li>Sprite always follows your mouse.</li>
                            <li>Sprite(2) stays in one place, but always points toward Sprite.</li>
                        </ul>
