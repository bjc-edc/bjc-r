		<p> A script is a sequence of instructions—an <strong>algorithm</strong>—that tells a computer what to do. A <strong>program</strong> is a set of <strong>scripts</strong>. In some programming languages, like <span class="snap">snap</span>, you program by dragging blocks (individual instructions) and snapping them together into scripts. In other languages, you <em>type</em> instructions to create scripts. The idea is the same.</p>
<p>For now, you're using blocks that come built in with <span class="snap">snap</span>. Soon, you'll invent and create your own blocks&mdash;blocks that <span class="snap">snap</span> does not provide.</p>
