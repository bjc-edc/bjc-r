		<h2>Creating Scripts</h2>
        <div>You can snap  blocks together (hence the name <span class="snap">snap</span>) to build up a set of instructions, a <em>script</em>. Drag one block right underneath another to snap them together. The white bar that appears (see the picture below) shows you where the block will go after you drop it.  A <span class="snap">snap</span> program consists of one or more  scripts.</div>
    	<div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>Create this two-block script in the scripting area. Click on it a few times to see what it does.
                    <div class="sidenote">
                        <div>While a script is running its border is highlighted. This one runs so quickly that you may have to look closely to notice the brief border flash.</div>
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/topic1_blocks_snapping.png" style="height:8em;" alt="Blocks Snapping Together"/>
                    </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="sidenote">
                        <div>
                            This script takes longer to run, so it's easier to notice the highlighted border:<br />
                            <img src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/topic1_highlightedscript.png" alt="Script Running"/>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    Here is another script to create. Predict what it will do, and then try it out.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/topic1_justmadeascript.png" style="height:8em;" alt="You just made a script!"/><br/>
                 </li>
             </ol>
        </div>
        <div>Blocks in a script run in a specific order, from the top of the script to the bottom. Generally, <span class="snap">snap</span> waits until one block has finished its job before continuing on to the block below it. (One common exception is blocks that play sounds: a block's job can be to <i>start</i> the sound, which means the block below it will execute while the sound is still playing.)</div>
