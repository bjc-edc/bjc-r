        <h2>Getting to Know the <span class="snap">snap</span> Interface</h2>
        <div>We name the sections of the <em><span class="snap">snap</span> </em> window so that we can talk about them. 
             The descriptions below are just introductions. You can always look things up, if you like, in 
             <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/SnapManual.pdf target="_blank">the <span class="snap">snap</span>  manual</a> for more detail.</div>
		<div><img src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/topic1_snapwindow.png" alt="Snap Window Regions" class="imageRight"/></div>
        
        <h3>Palette</h3>
        <div>The area called the <em>palette</em> contains the blocks (individual instructions) that you will use 
        to tell the computer what you want it to do. The blocks are organized into eight categories according to 
        the kind of thing each block does. </div>
        
        <h3>Scripting Area</h3>
        <div>You will drag blocks of code to the Scripting Area to create scripts to control the computer. 
        The script shown here has two blocks: "when green flag is clicked" and "say Hello!"</div>

        <h3>Stage</h3>
        <div>The Stage is where <strong>sprites</strong>—little on-screen robots—act out the code you write. 
        This sprite is saying "hello" because
        that is what its script told it to do when the green flag was clicked.

        <h3>Sprite Corral</h3>
        <div>The Sprite Corral houses all of the sprites that you (or someone) created. 
        You are given one sprite to start with; you can create more if you like. 
        When a sprite is selected, the Scripting Area shows what instructions it understands.
        The picture here shows only one sprite in the corral. </div> 

		<h3>Tool Bar</h3>
    	<div>The Toolbar across the very top of the screen includes buttons for  
        the File menu <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button"/> 
        for saving and loading your projects, 
        the Cloud menu <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="Cloud button"/> 
        with options related to your <span class="snap">snap</span> account, 
        the Settings menu <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/settings_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="settings button"/> 
        with advanced options, 
        window resizing buttons <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/screen-size_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="screen-size button"/> <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/full-screen_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="full-screen button"/>, and 
        Project Control Buttons (green flag <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="green-flag button"/>, pause <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pause_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="pause button"/>, and stop <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="stop button"/>). 
        You can click on these various buttons to see a bit more about what they do. <br />
        You can also click on the <span class="snap">snap</span>  logo  <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Snap Logo.png" alt="Snap Logo"/>
         for more information. </div>
