        <p>You can treat your custom-made blocks like any other block in snap, including using them within other blocks you define. You've already done that at least once when you wrote <code>house</code>. </p>
        <p>In fact, the <em>best</em> way to solve bigger programming tasks is usually by writing simple blocks that are used within slightly more complicated blocks, which are in turn used in even more complicated blocks, and so on. When you build blocks made of other blocks you've built, this is called <strong>composition</strong> of blocks.</p>
        <p>You will practice this a bit more here, and we'll look more closely at this sort of composition of blocks later on, because it is an important idea in computer science.</p>

Calling <img class="block" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-square-petal-flower-6-50-parameters.png" alt="block: draw a flower with 6 petals of size 50"> should draw the example picture above.</li>
