                	<div class="comment">We should always include written instructions when there is an animated gif. --MARY</div>
                    <p>We don't want the sprites to repeat their movements forever.  We want them to <code>repeat until</code> they touch each other, and then stop.</p>
                    <p>Change <code>Sprite(2)</code>'s code to <code>point towards Sprite</code> until it is <code>touching Sprite</code>. This video shows how:</p>

                </li>
                <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" />
				<li>Now, go back to <code>Sprite</code>'s code and tell it to follow your mouse <em>only</em> until it is <code>touching Sprite(2)</code>.</li>
				<li> <div class="sidenoteBig">When you click <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="green-flag button"/>,  the <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/sprite.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="the gray Sprite"> should follow your mouse.  Sprite(2) should keep facing <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/sprite.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="the gray Sprite"> until you bring <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/sprite.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="the gray Sprite"> close enough for the two to touch.</div> Try out your program. </li>
				<li>
                	Sprite(2) <em>points toward</em> Sprite, but doesn't <em>move</em> toward it. <br /> Add a line of code so that Sprite(2) chases Sprite.<br />
					<pre>
 	repeat until touching
	  {
	     point towards (Sprite)
	     move a tiny amount
	  }</pre>
					You may want each &quot;tiny amount&quot; to be even less than 1 step so that Sprite(2) doesn't catch Sprite too quickly.
					<div class="takeNote">This kind of written-out code is often called &quot;pseudo-code.&quot; It isn't precisely what your code would look like in <em>any</em> programming language but it makes the logical steps clear. There are no special &quot;rules&quot; for writing pseudo-code. You may use your own style as long as you specify the logical steps clearly.</div>
				</li>
				<li>Test your program a few times. <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap-mini.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /></li>

					<p>
                        Right now, when the sprites meet, they just stop. <br />
                        Make them have a conversation when they stop. <br />
                        You can do that by adding code like this to Sprite(2)'s script. <br />
                        Make up your own dialogue. You can use any language you can type.
					</p>
                    <div class="sidenote">This code puts <code>Sprite(2)</code> in charge of <code>Sprite</code>.</div>
                    <p> Sprite(2) does things itself. It also tells <code>Sprite</code> what to do and when to do it. </p>
