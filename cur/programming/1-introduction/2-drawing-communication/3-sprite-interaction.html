		<h2>Sprite Interaction</h2>
		<p>Now, change the script so that the sprites don't repeat their movements forever, but <code>repeat until</code> they touch each other and then stop.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
				<li>
                    Change Sprite(2)'s code to point towards Sprite only until it is touching Sprite.  Follow these instructions or watch the animation below:
                    	<ol>
                        	<li>Click the Sprite(2) button below the stage.</li>
                            <li>Replace the <code>forever</code> block with a <code>repeat until</code> block</li>
                            <li>Drag a <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/touching.png"  alt="touching sprite"> block into the hexagonal space in the <code>repeat until</code> block, and set it to repeat until it is touching Sprite.</li>
                        </ol>                        
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Replacing-code.gif" alt="Replacing code" title="Replacing code" />
                </li>
				<li>Change Sprite's code to follow your mouse only until it is <code>touching Sprite(2)</code>.</li>
                <li> Try out your program. </li>
				<div class="endnote">When you click <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="green-flag button"/>, Sprite (the gray one) should follow your mouse and Sprite(2) should keep turning to face Sprite. But once you bring Sprite close enough for the two to touch, both sprites should stop moving.</div>
                <li>
                	Sprite(2) <em>points toward</em> Sprite, but doesn't <em>move</em> toward it.  Add a line of code so that Sprite(2) chases Sprite. Here's the idea:<br />
					<div class="sidenoteBig">You may want each "tiny amount" to be even less than 1 step so that Sprite(2) doesn't catch Sprite too quickly.</div>
					<pre class="indent" style="width:300px;">
repeat until touching
    {
        point towards (Sprite)
        move a tiny amount
    }</pre>
					<div class="takeNote">This kind of written-out code is often called &quot;pseudo-code.&quot; It isn't precisely what your code would look like in <em>any</em> programming language, but it makes the logical steps clear. There are no special &quot;rules&quot; for writing pseudo-code. You may use your own style as long as you specify the logical steps clearly.</div>
				</li>
    			<li>Test your program a few times. </li>

                <li>
                	<p>Right now, when the sprites meet, they just stop. Make them have a conversation when they stop. You can do that by adding code like this to Sprite(2)'s script. Make up your own conversation. You can use any language you can type.</p>
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">Sprite(2) does things itself. It also tells Sprite what to do and when to do it. This code puts Sprite(2) in charge of Sprite.</div>
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">
                        <p class="center"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" /></p>
                        In the current version of <span class="snap">snap</span>, the <code>tell</code> block isn't installed automatically. Click on the File <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-file-menu.png" class="inline" style="height:1.7em;" alt="File menu icon" title="File menu icon" /> menu at the top of the <span class="snap">snap</span> window and select "Import Tools." The <code>tell</code> block will appear toward the end of the Control palette. You'll need to import tools once into each new <span class="snap">snap</span> project where you need <code>tell</code>.

                <li>You can give the sprites costumes. You can even use a photograph or picture from the Internet by dragging the picture into the costume area for that sprite. If the picture you choose is too big, set its size to something less than 100% using <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-size.png" alt="set size to (100)%" title="set size to (100)%" />. </li>
                <li>You can make a dialogue about school or home or work or play. </li>
                <li>You can add a third sprite and have it do something, too.</li>
                <li>
                    You can even change the background on the stage.<br />
