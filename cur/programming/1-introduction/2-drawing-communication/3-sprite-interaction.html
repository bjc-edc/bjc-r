                    Change Sprite(2)'s code to point towards Sprite only until it is touching Sprite.  Follow these instructions or watch the animation below:

                        <li>Click the Sprite(2) button below the stage.</li>

                            Drag a <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/touching.png"  alt="touching sprite"> block into the hexagonal space in the <code>repeat until</code> block, and set it to repeat until it is touching Sprite.<br />

				<div class="endnote">When you click <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="green-flag button"/>, Sprite (the gray one) should follow your mouse and Sprite(2) should keep turning to face Sprite. But once you bring Sprite close enough for the two to touch, both sprites should stop moving.</div>
                <li>
                	Sprite(2) <em>points toward</em> Sprite, but doesn't <em>move</em> toward it.  Add a line of code so that Sprite(2) chases Sprite. Here's the idea:<br />
					<div class="sidenoteBig">You may want each "tiny number" to be even less than 1 step so that Sprite(2) doesn't catch Sprite too quickly.</div>

<!--					<div class="takeNote">This kind of written-out code is often called "pseudo-code." It isn't precisely what your code would look like in <em>any</em> programming language, but it makes the logical steps clear. There are no special "rules" for writing pseudo-code. You may use your own style as long as you specify the logical steps clearly.</div> --></li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>GH Feedback 9/8: Having a variable called "a tiny number" (and similar variables elsewhere in the lessons) can confuse students. I understand the intent (I think), and it is a quick lesson to help them understand, but this lesson is about REPEAT UNTIL and putting the number 1 in the input slot would be less confusing.</li>
                        <li>GH Feedback 9/20/15: You ask the students to create a variable "a tiny number of" before they know how to create variables!</li>
                        <li>GH Feedback 9/21/15: what do you mean "a tiny # of" This is confusing.</li>
                        <li>GH Feedback 9/22/15: Are students expected to create a variable "tiny number of steps"?</li>
                        <li>From Brian: Those teachers are confused.  There is no intent for students to make a variable; that block is there as documentation of an idea. I think probably their problem would be solved if you made the "a tiny number of" block grey (Other) instead of orange (Variables). The teachers who want us just to say 1 there are less confused, but didn't read the sidenote.</li>
                        <li>GH Feedback 9/24/15: did we introduce variables yet? Is that how we are supposed to make "a tiny number of"?</li>
                        <li>GH Feedback 9/27/15: Item 4. The move "a tiny number of" steps threw the kids off. They were looking for a block with that name. The instructions aren't clear that is just a blank placeholder in which they are supposed to substitute a value.</li>
                        <li>
                            GH Feedback 10/6/15: The "a tiny number of " variable block is confusing.<br />
                            Especially since they do not know how to use variables yet.
