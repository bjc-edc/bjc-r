		<h2>Drawing with Two Sprites</h2>
    
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Analyze and predict:</strong> How are the behaviors of these four scripts the same? How are they different? <br /> 
	                <div class="sidenote">Analyzing these scripts will help you control the speed of the drawings in the problems below.</div>
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever(move100-turn90).png" alt="Forever [ move (100), turn (90)]" title="Forever [ move (100), turn (90)]" />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever(repeat10(move10)-turn90).png" alt="Forever [repeat (10) [move (10)], turn (90)]" title="Forever [repeat (10) [move (10)], turn (90)]" /> 
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever(repeat20(move5)-turn90).png" alt="Forever [repeat (20) [move (5)], turn (90)]" title="Forever [repeat (20) [move (5)], turn (90)]" /> 
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever(repeat100(move1)-turn90).png" alt="Forever [repeat (100) [move (1)], turn(90)]" title="Forever [repeat (100) [move (1)], turn(90)]" />
                </li>
                <li><div class="newProject"><span class="text">"U1L2-SpriteOrbit"</span><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/new-project-called.png" alt="Create a new project called U1L1-Name" title="Create a new project called U1L1-Name" /></div></li>	
                <li>Give Sprite a script that, <em>when started</em>, draws a blue square, drawing each line at some medium speed.</li>
                <div class="endnote">When you are finished, double-check that your script does exactly what you mean for it to. This is always a good idea when coding because if you move on with part of the program still not working, you will only compound your problems.</div>
                
                <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /> 
                
                <li>
                	Create a second sprite with a script that does this:<br />
                    <div class="sideHOMbig">One &quot;line&quot; of pseudo-code may require more than one line of code in the language you are using. For example, &quot;draw in red&quot; requires two <span class="snap">snap</span> commands, one so that the sprite draws when it moves, and one to set the pen's color.</div>	
					<pre class="indent" style="width:300px;">
when started
draw in red
forever
    {
        point towards (Sprite)
        move (5) steps
    }</pre>  
                </li>
                <li>Test your program. Make sure that it starts both sprites at the same time (for example, with <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="green-flag button"/>).</li>


				<li>Experiment with the speeds of each sprite. 
                    <ol>
                        <li>What happens if Sprite(2) moves 20 steps instead of 5 steps each time it goes through the forever-loop?</li>
                        <li>What if Sprite(2) moves only 2 steps?</li>
                        <li>What if Sprite draws its square more quickly? </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/write-out-thoughts.png" alt="Write Out Your Thoughts" title="Write Out Your Thoughts" /> Describe the results of your experiments. Include pictures of the screen to show what happened. Try to explain <em>why</em> each picture came out as it did.</li>
          </ol>
		</div>
	
    	<div class="takeItFurther">
            <p>Sprite doesn't need to move in a square. Try one or more of the following experiments.</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Change Sprite's turn to 144 degrees.</li>
                <li> Change Sprite's turn so that it makes an equilateral triangle. </li>
                <li>Change Sprite's turn to 10 degrees and make the distance it moves in each step much smaller than 100.</li>
                <li>

                    Try to make some other interesting designs. Here are some examples:<br />
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-turn-design-01.png" alt="move turn design 1" title="move turn design 1" />

                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-turn-design-03.png" alt="move turn design 3" title="move turn design 3" />
                </li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/write-out-thoughts.png" alt="Write Out Your Thoughts" title="Write Out Your Thoughts" /> Describe the results of your experiments. Include pictures and explanations.</li>
