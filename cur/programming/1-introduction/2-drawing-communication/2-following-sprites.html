                <li>GH Feedback 9/10/15: I would like to suggest more questions on this page. It's great material, but not enough places for the kids to stop and think.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 10/24/15: Need more specific attention to the Sprite(2) script. We just start using it and students gloss over that this is a separate script for the second sprite.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>In this lab, you will program <em>two</em> sprites. One sprite will follow your mouse. The other sprite will chase the first. When they meet, they will have a short conversation.</p>

                <li>
                    Read and think about this script before you build it. What do you expect it to do?
                    <div class="sidenoteBig"><img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-x.png" class="inline" alt="Mouse X Reporter"/> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-y.png" class="inline" alt="Mouse Y Reporter"/> report the mouse's location on the stage. You can find them in the Sensing palette.</div> 
                    <p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/follow-that-mouse.png" alt="Follow That Mouse Script" title="Follow That Mouse Script" /></p>

                	<div class="sidenote">To <em>stop</em> this script, click the red stop sign <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="stop button"/>. </div>
					Now build the script and run it. Move your mouse around the stage while the program is running.
                </li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Does the program work the way you expected?</li>
				<li>
                	Create a second sprite that turns toward the first sprite.<a name="newTurtle" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>Follow these instructions or watch the animation below.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Click on the "add a new Turtle sprite" button just below the stage: <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/add-a-new-turtle-sprite.png" alt="add a new turtle sprite" title="add a new turtle sprite" /></li>
                        <div class="endnote">The new sprite appears on the stage, and a button to select it appears underneath the stage. This sprite is brand new so it has no scripts. You will need to drag in blocks to tell it what to do. If you want to see any sprite's scripts, click on its button below the stage. </div>
                        <li>
                        	Add a line of code to Sprite(2) to make it point towards Sprite.
                        	<div class="todo">The project name in the animation doesn't match the name they're told to use.</div>

				<li> 
                	Change your script for Sprite(2) so that once the green flag is clicked, it will point towards Sprite forever. Follow these instructions or watch the animation below. <br />
					<!--<pre>
	when started
	forever 
	  {
	     point towards (Sprite)
	  }</pre>-->

                </li>
                <div class="endnote">While a script is running, its border is highlighted. Some scripts run so quickly that you may not notice the brief border flash. This script runs forever, so it's easier to notice the highlighted border.</div>
                <li>
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Click <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="green-flag button"/> and check that your script does what you had intended it to:
                        <ul> 
		                	<div class="sidenoteBig">Both sprites' scripts start with <code>When<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="green-flag button"/>clicked</code>. So, when <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="green-flag button"/> is clicked, <em>both</em> sprites' scripts run.</div>
                            <li>Sprite always follows your mouse around the stage.</li>
                            <li>Sprite(2) stays in the same place, but always points toward Sprite.</li>
                        </ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
