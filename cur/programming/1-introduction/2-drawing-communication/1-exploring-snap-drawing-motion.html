		<p>You have already programmed an app in the <span class="snap">snap</span> programming language. </p>
        <p>A <strong>program</strong> is a set of <strong>scripts</strong> that tell a computer what to do. A script is an ordered (top to bottom) sequence of instructions. In <span class="snap">snap</span>, you program by dragging blocks (individual instructions) and snapping them together into scripts. </p>
		<p>Now, you will experiment with some more blocks that <span class="snap">snap</span> provides to learn what they do. Soon, you will create your own blocks of code&mdash;blocks that <span class="snap">snap</span> doesn't have.</p>
