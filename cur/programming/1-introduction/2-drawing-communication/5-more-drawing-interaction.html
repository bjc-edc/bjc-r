                    Start with one sprite and give it this script. 
                    <p>
                    	<div class="sidenote">You don't need to add the comments that are in yellow boxes on the side. <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> You <em>can</em> add comments to any script if you like by right-clicking (or control-clicking) on the scripting area's gray background <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/gray background of scripting area.png" alt="picture of gray background"> and selecting &quot;add comment.&quot;</p></div> 
                    	<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/New-sprite-chase-script.png" alt="New sprite chase script">
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Now <em>duplicate</em> that sprite by control clicking on the sprite's <em>button</em> (not the sprite, itself) and selecting &quot;duplicate.&quot;<br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Duplicating a sprite.png" alt="duplicating a sprite"></li>
                <div class="takeNote">Earlier, you created a brand new sprite using <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Add-a-new-turtle-sprite.png"    alt="add a new turtle sprite">. <br /> It had no script because it was brand new.  <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> This time, you <em>duplicated</em> an existing sprite. The clone (the duplicated sprite) gets everything that the original sprite had.</p></div>
                <li>Change Sprite(2)'s script so that it will set the pen color to red, point in direction 180, and move 5 (not -5) steps.</li>
                <li>Change Sprite(2)'s script so that it points towards Sprite. Then change Sprite's script so that it points towards Sprite(2).</li>
                <li>What happens when the r key is pressed?</li>
                <li>What happens when the space key is pressed?</li>
                <li><strong>Experiment: </strong>Change Sprite's script so that it backs away only 4 steps <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move -4 steps.png" alt="move -4 steps"> instead of 5. Reset and start and see what happens. Discuss why this might happen.</li>
