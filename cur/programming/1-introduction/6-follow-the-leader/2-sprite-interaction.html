		<h2>Sprite Following a Sprite</h2>
		<p>Now, change the script so that the sprites don't move forever, but only <code>repeat until</code> they touch.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
				<li>
                    Change Sprite(2)'s code to point towards Sprite only until it is touching Sprite. The following instructions and animation show how.
					<ol>
                    	<li>Select Sprite(2) by clicking its button below the stage.</li>
                        <li>Replace the <code>forever</code> block with a <code>repeat until</code> block.</li>
                        <li>
                        	Drag <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/touching.png" alt="touching sprite">  into the hexagonal space in the <code>repeat until</code> block. Set it to repeat until it is <code>touching Sprite</code>.<br />
                            <img data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/replacing-code.gif" alt="Replacing code" title="Replacing code" />
                        </li>
                    </ol>                        
                </li>
				<li>Do the same for  Sprite. Change its code to follow your mouse only until it is <code>touching Sprite(2)</code>.</li>
                <li> Test your program to see if it does what you want:
                	<ul>
                    	<li>When you click <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="green-flag button"/>, Sprite (the gray one) should follow your mouse and Sprite(2) should keep turning to face Sprite.</li>
                        <li>If you bring Sprite close enough  to touch Sprite(2), both sprites should stop moving.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                	So far, Sprite(2) <em>points </em>toward Sprite, but doesn't <em>move</em> toward it.  Add a line of code to Sprite(2)'s script so that it chases Sprite. Here's the idea:<br /><div class="sidenote">Fill the input slot in the <code>move</code> block with a tiny number (probably less than 1) so  Sprite(2) doesn't catch Sprite too quickly.</div>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-tiny.png" alt="repeat until touching, point toward sprite, move a tiny amount">
<!--					<div class="takeNote">This kind of written-out code is often called "pseudo-code." It isn't precisely what your code would look like in <em>any</em> programming language, but it makes the logical steps clear. There are no special "rules" for writing pseudo-code. You may use your own style as long as you specify the logical steps clearly.</div> -->
					
				</li>
				<li>Test your program a few times. </li>

                <li>
                	<p>Right now, when the sprites meet, they just stop. Make them have a conversation when they stop. You can do that by adding code like this to Sprite(2)'s script. Make up your own conversation. You can use any language you can type.</p>
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">Sprite(2) does things itself. It also tells Sprite what to do and when to do it. This code puts Sprite(2) in charge of Sprite.</div>
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">
                        <p class="center"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" /></p>
                        In the current version of <span class="snap">snap</span>, the <code>tell</code> block isn't installed automatically. Click on the File <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-file-menu.png" class="inline" style="height:1.7em;" alt="File menu icon" title="File menu icon" /> menu at the top of the <span class="snap">snap</span> window and select "Import Tools." The <code>tell</code> block will appear toward the end of the Control palette. You'll need to import tools once into each new <span class="snap">snap</span> project where you need <code>tell</code>.

            <ol start="7">
                <li>You can give the sprites costumes. You can even use a photograph or picture from the Internet by dragging the picture into the costume area for that sprite. If the picture you choose is too big, set its size to something less than 100% using <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-size-empty.png" alt="set size to (100)%" title="set size to (100)%" />. </li>
				<li>You can make a dialogue about school or home or work. </li>
                <li>You can add a third sprite and have it do something, too.</li>
                <li>
                    You can even change the background on the stage.<br />
