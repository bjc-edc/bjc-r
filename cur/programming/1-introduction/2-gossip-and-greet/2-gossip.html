            <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is the most fundamental idea in computer science, but it's hard to define until you've seen some examples.  The most basic kind of abstraction is to <em>give a name</em> to something in a program. For example, here we gave the name <code>who</code> to the idea "pick an item at random from this list of people (or cats)." This is called <strong><em>procedural</em> abstraction</strong> because we use a procedure (a block) to name the idea. This makes your code readable. You'll see other kinds of abstraction later.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="ap-standard">AAP-3.B.7</div>
        <p>If you find yourself wanting to copy and paste code from one place to another without changing it, then give it a name (open a Block Editor and paste the code there) and call your procedure in both places. If you discover later on that you need to fix a bug in this code, you only have to change it once instead of finding every copy throughout your program.</p>
