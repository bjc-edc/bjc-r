        <h2>Modeling Language</h2>
        <div class="todo"><strong>Why this? Why here?</strong> I couldn't answer this, which felt problematic. Further experience with reporters, lists, and abstraction? <strong>Should this be an optional project?</strong> --MF, 9/10/18</div>
		<div class="learn"><p>On this page, you will use reporters and lists to create a program capable of creating more complicated language than the Gossip project.</p></div>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>nouns</strong> (things)</li>
                        <li><strong>verbs</strong> (actions)</li>
                        <li><strong>adjectives</strong> (thing describers)</li>
                        <li><strong>adverbs</strong> (action describers)</li>

                    <p>It contains six reporters that each report a random word from a list of words in that category.</p>
                </li>
				<li>Change these lists however you like to include your own nouns, verbs, etc.</li>
				<li>
                    Create a reporter called <code>simple sentence</code> that reports a simple sentence using the <code>random determiner</code>, <code>random noun</code>, and <code>random verb</code> blocks.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Complicated sentences are built up from multiple phrases. Create three other reporters that report different kinds of phrases:
                    <ol>
                        <li><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/noun_phrase.png" alt="green noun phrase reporter block" title="green noun phrase reporter block"> should join words from three categories to create phrases like "the little boy," "a green giraffe," or "our old sandwich." </li>
                        <li><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/prep_phrase.png" alt="green prepositional phrase reporter block" title="green prepositional phrase reporter block"> should combine a preposition with a <code>noun phrase</code> to create phrases like "near the little boy" or "over a wise pizza." </li>
                        <div class="takeNote">Defining <code>prepositional phrase</code> using the <code>noun phrase</code> block is a good example of abstraction. If you later change <code>noun phrase</code> to include people's names, <code>prepositional phrase</code> will still work.</div>
                        <li><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/verb_phrase.png" alt="green verb phrase reporter block" title="green verb phrase reporter block"> should join a verb and an adverb to create phrases like "jumps sadly," "naps quickly," or "thinks sleepily."</li>
					</ol>
                </li>
                <div class="endnote">These phrases will be grammatically correct, but they won't necessarily make sense. For example, <code>noun phrase</code> might generate "a tired pizza."</div>
                <li>
                    Then, make a reporter <code>complicated sentence</code> that combines a noun phrase, a verb phrase, and a prepositional phrase.

                    I wanted to keep this one, but I can't figure how they would handle multiple cases with the content that has been introduced so far. --MF, 9/11/18
                    <li>Noun phrases don't always have to have one adjective. They can have none, or two, or more. Add some variety.</li>

            <p>Maybe plurals (and/or some of the other cut TIFs from the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/optional-projects/old/3-modeling-sentence-structures.html" title="old Modeling Sentence Structures page">old Modeling Sentence Structures page</a>) could be an optional project in U2 <em>that builds on this one.</em> --MF, 9/11/18</p>
