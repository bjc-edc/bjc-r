        <h2>Modeling Language</h2>
        <div class="todo"><strong>Why this? Why here?</strong> I couldn't answer this, which felt problematic. Further experience with reporters, lists, and abstraction? Should this be an optional project? --MF, 9/10/18</div>
		<div class="learn"><p>On this page, you will use reporters and lists to create a program capable of creating more complicated language than the Gossip project.</p></div>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>nouns</strong> (things)</li>
                        <li><strong>verbs</strong> (actions)</li>
                        <li><strong>adjectives</strong> (thing describers)</li>

                    <p>It contains six reporters that each report a random word from a list of words in that category.</p>
                </li>
				<li>Change these lists however you like to include your own nouns, verbs, etc.</li>
				<li>
                    Create a reporter called <code>simple sentence</code> that reports a simple sentence using the <code>random determiner</code>, <code>random noun</code>, and <code>random verb</code> blocks. 
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/simple-sentence-reporting.png" alt="simple sentence reporting 'a boy jumps'" title="simple sentence reporting 'a boy jumps'" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Complicated sentences are built up from multiple phrases. Create three other reporters that report different kinds of phrases:
                    <ol>
                        <li><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/noun_phrase.png" alt="green noun phrase reporter block" title="green noun phrase reporter block"> should join words from three categories to create phrases like "the little boy," "a green giraffe," or "our old sandwich." </li>
                        <li><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/prep_phrase.png" alt="green prepositional phrase reporter block" title="green prepositional phrase reporter block"> should combine a preposition with a <code>noun phrase</code> to create phrases like "near the little boy" or "over a wise pizza." </li>
                        <div class="takeNote">Defining <code>prepositional phrase</code> using the <code>noun phrase</code> block is a good example of abstraction. If you later change <code>noun phrase</code> to include people's names, <code>prepositional phrase</code> will still work.</div>
                        <li><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/verb_phrase.png" alt="green verb phrase reporter block" title="green verb phrase reporter block"> should join a verb and an adverb to create phrases like "jumps sadly," "naps quickly," or "thinks sleepily."</li>
					</ol>
                </li>
                <div class="endnote">These phrases will be grammatically correct, but they won't necessarily make sense. For example, <code>noun phrase</code> might generate "a tired pizza."</div>
                <li>
                    Then, make a reporter <code>complicated sentence</code> that combines a noun phrase, a verb phrase, and a prepositional phrase.

            <p>This page is a very small beginning toward teaching the computer to understand English sentence structure. If you find the topic interesting, there's a lot more you can do; this could be the beginning of your final course project. <em>You don't have to do any of this.</em> If you find it boring, go to the next page. But if you find it interesting, there's a long road from &quot;The blue elephant sits down angrily in front of the television&quot; to &quot;Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.&quot; (That's the opening sentence of <em>David Copperfield</em> by Charles Dickens.) Here are a few suggestions to make your sentences more interesting, but don't be limited by them; be creative.</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <div class="todo">A and B don't feel like TIF content--maybe ITIT? --MF, 9/10/18</div>
                <li>Occasionally include people's names instead of a <code>noun phrase</code>. So, instead of something like "my silly elephant", the program could sometimes use "Alfred" or some other names. </li>
                <li>Noun phrases don't always have to have one adjective. They can have none, or two, or more. </li>

                <div class="sidenoteBig">Your old Snap<em>!</em> project should be called "U2Lab1-Plural".</div>
                <div class="todo">TODO: Edit C to make it work here. --MF, 9/10/18</div>
                <li>Use your <code>plural</code> block from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/5-plurals1.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 2</a> to let your nouns sometimes be plural. Your program may need two separate expressions, one for singular sentences and one for plural ones, since the verb has to match the noun: "the kangaroo jumps" but "the kangaroos jump."</li>
                <div class="todo">Also, in part D, we should think about whether this is the simplest kind of question. Another candidate would be "Who ...?" which just requires changing noun phrase. (from Brian??)<p>I love D and want to keep it! --MF, 9/10/18</p></div>
                <li>Find a way to create questions. (The sentence could start with a <code>question phrase</code> like "Who,"  "Why does," "Did," or "How did."  Different question words might require different sentence structures.)</li>
                <div class="todo">Edit E so it makes more sense. --MF, 9/10/18</div>
        		<li>So far you've used verbs that describe an action someone just does (<em>intransitive</em> verbs). Another kind of verb describes an action someone does <em>to someone,</em> or <em>to something,</em> such as &quot;eats&quot; or &quot;sits on&quot; or &quot;loves&quot; (<em>transitive</em> verbs). Make a list of transitive verbs, and make sentences using <code>noun phrase</code> twice, once for the actor and once for the acted-upon.</li>
      <!--          <div class="endnote">You might want to create a <code>question verb phrase </code> block that is a version of <code>verb phrase</code> that reports the  verb without the "s" as the end. Compare the statement "The tired elephant climb<strong><em>s</em></strong> over the pizza" to the question "Did the tired elephant climb_ over the pizza?" </div>  -->
