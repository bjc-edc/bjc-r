            <ul>
                <li>Now we tell them that a function is defined by the shape of a block. “Note: Mathematicians use the word “function” in a slightly different way from computer scientists. Don’t worry if you hear something in math class that differs [← What, me worry?] from what you see in BJC.” Of course they should worry and they should try to resolve the different uses of the word.</li>
                <ul><li>I like the vocab box on this page, but in reading it again, I feel like I come away not knowing what to call anything! In fact, I commented on this point <em>myself</em> just two pages ago! Something needs to be added at the end that says: "In this class you should say..." so they have a clear take-away. --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>
                <li>We explain what a purple box is even though it showed up earlier. And are TIFs always harder? What does it mean: harder? Tough stuff doesn’t necessarily mean “harder.”</li>
                <ul><li>The first point should be fixed. The second point is on the Y4 TODO list for discussion on 6/5/18. --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>

                <h4><strong>Block Building Essentials</strong></h4>
                <p>In Snap<em>!</em>, every block needs a <strong>color category</strong>, also known as a <strong>palette</strong>.  Gray ("Other") is the default. It also needs a <strong>type</strong> (shown by the block's shape), a <strong>title</strong>, and a <strong>script</strong> that defines its behavior.</p>

            <p>In many programming languages, what Snap<em>!</em> calls a <em>reporter</em> (blocks with an oval shape like <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-args.png" alt="pick random () to ()" title="pick random () to ()" />) is called a <strong>function</strong> and what Snap<em>!</em> calls a <em>command</em> (blocks with a puzzle shape like <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/point-in-direction-90.png" alt="point in direction (90)" title="point in direction (90)" />) is called a <strong>procedure</strong>. But programming languages are not consistent about this. Some use "function" for both, and others use "procedure" for both. (Also, most languages use these words only for procedures or functions that <em>you</em> write, <em>not</em> the ones that are built into the language.)</p>
