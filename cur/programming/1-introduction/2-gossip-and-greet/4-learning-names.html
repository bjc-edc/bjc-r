            <strong>BH/PG/AC/MF FP meeting (6/18/18):</strong> 
            <p>Animation should be redone so that the name is added to the list before the greeting is said. Also, change the sprite costume so that it's not a child younger than our students. --MF, 6/18/18</p>

            <p>PG: I absolutely cannot stand the costume. I know that's personal rather than logical, but it feels /so/ elementary school. At a logical level, I don't think /we/ should be making these choices at all. The PURPOSE (pink box) section should be about what kids will newly be able to do. I agree with Brian's one-time comment that "what you will learn" feels schoolish, but the idea of the section /for **us**/ was to focus on what new learning the lesson was about, and we can offer that to kids in a non-toxic way. The PURPOSE is not "so that first-timers get a different greeting." Machines can gather information, and that lets the programmer decide how to use it. The vocab section is too much, too early. Perhaps "condition." Not yet algorithm, selection, sequencing, ordering.... </p>
            <p>BH: I think this is the first use of a global variable, but with no explanation.</p>
            <p>MF: several comments/discussions to resolve</p>

                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will create a <code>greet player</code> script that greets users and <em>remembers their names</em> so that first-timers get a different greeting from return visitors.

                    Deciding (selecting) which part of an algorithm to run based on a condition is called <strong>selection</strong>.
                    In this project, the decision is made by <code>if-else</code>: <br />

                <li>
                    The <code>if</code> and <code>if-else</code> blocks are called <strong>conditionals</strong> because they control the code based on a true-or-false <strong>condition</strong> (here, whether the list of players contains this player's name). 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sequencing</strong> means that the computer carries out the instructions in the order in which they appear in your code.</li>
                <li>The <strong>flow of control</strong> is the order in which instructions are carried out.</p>
