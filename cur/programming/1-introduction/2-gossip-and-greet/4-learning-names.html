		<h2>Learning Player Names</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p>
                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will create a <code>greet player</code> script that greets users (such as "Anthony") by either:
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Saying "Nice to <em>meet</em> you, Anthony" and storing Anthony's name in a <var>player list</var> for next time.</li> 
                    or
                    <li>Saying "Nice to <em>see</em> you again, Anthony" if  Anthony's name is already on the list.</li>
                </ol>
        <!--        <div class="sidenote">This project is an introductory example of a cutting edge field in computer science called Machine Learning.</div>  -->
	            <img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/U1ImageVideoAddendum_img/U1L2P4-MeetGreet.gif" width="500" alt="greet player example" title="greet player example" />
            </p>
		</div>
                          
		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first"> 
            <ol>
                <div class="vocabBig"><a name="AP" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
                    <p>
                        The decision is made by <code>if-else</code>. <br />
                        <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/greet-player-skeleton.png" alt="greet player skeleton" title="greet player skeleton" /><br />
                        The <code>if</code> and <code>if-else</code> blocks are called <em>conditionals</em> because they control the code based on a <strong>condition</strong> (here, whether the list of players contains this player's name). Deciding (selecting) which part of an algorithm to run based on a condition is called <strong>selection</strong>.
                    </p>
                	<p><strong>Sequencing</strong> is the process of <em>ordering</em> the code (putting it in a sequence), as you do here.</p>
                </div> 
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/U1L2-GreetPlayer.xml" class="run">Load this file</a>, and save it to your Snap<em>!</em> account. It contains most of the code you'll need to make the script.</li>
				<li>
                    Snap the pieces together in a sequence so that:
					  <ol type="a">
                        <li>The greeter will <code>ask</code> the player for their name.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>If</strong> the player's name is in the  <var>player list</var>, 
                            <ul><li><code>Say</code> "nice to see you again, <em>player name</em>." </li></ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Otherwise</strong> when the player isn't on the list,
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>Say</code> "nice to meet you, <em>player name</em>," and </li>
                                <li><code>Add</code> the player's name to the <var>player list</var>. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
				</li>
				<li>Test and debug. Make sure the script works the way you want it to.</li>
				<li>Create a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/greet-player.png" alt="player greeter block" title="player greeter block" /> <em>command</em> block, and drag in your working script.</li>
                <li>Click <code>greet player</code> several times to test that it works as expected. Fix any bugs.</li>

        </div>
        
        <div class="takeItFurther">

                <li>
                    Add some enhancements to your script. For example:
                    <ol>
                        <li>If the guest is new, have the greeter ask "Do you have any pets?" and if they say "yes," then ask them what type of pet they have and store the answer along with the guest's name. <div class="sidenoteBig">Each entry to <var>player list</var> can be a list of <var>name</var> and <var>kind of pet</var> for each guest. </div></li>
                        <li>If the guest is known to the greeter and has a pet, have the greeter say "How's your <em>dog, cat, bird, ...</em>?" getting the kind of pet from the <var>player list</var>.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
