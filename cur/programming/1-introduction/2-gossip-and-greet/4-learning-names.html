            <p>Animation should be redone so that the name is added to the list before the greeting is said. Also, change the sprite costume so that it's not a child younger than our students. --MF, 6/18/18</p>
            <p>This appears is the first place where we talk about global variables; we should have a vocab box. --MF, 6/18/18</p>
            <p>Move this to U2 in place of 2.1.4, which should be junked except for the pieces that are needed for 2.2.3. --MF, 6/18/18</p>

                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will create a <code>greet player</code> script that greets users and <em>remembers their names</em> so that first-timers get a different greeting from return visitors.

                        The decision is made by <code>if-else</code>. <br />

                        The <code>if</code> and <code>if-else</code> blocks are called <em>conditionals</em> because they control the code based on a <strong>condition</strong> (here, whether the list of players contains this player's name). <div class="AP-only">Deciding (selecting) which part of an algorithm to run based on a condition is called <strong>selection</strong>.
