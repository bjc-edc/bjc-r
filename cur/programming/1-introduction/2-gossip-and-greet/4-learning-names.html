                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will create a <code>greet player</code> script that greets users and <em>remembers their names</em> so that first-timers get a different greeting from return visitors.

                <li>
                    Deciding (selecting) which part of an algorithm to run based on a condition is called <strong>selection</strong>.
                    In this project, the decision is made by <code>if-else</code>: <br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/greet-player-skeleton.png" width="350" alt="ask(What is your name?) and wait;if((player list) contains(answer)){}else{}" title="ask(What is your name?) and wait;if((player list) contains(answer)){}else{}"/><br />
                    The <code>if</code> and <code>if-else</code> blocks are called <strong>conditionals</strong> because they control the code based on a true-or-false <strong>condition</strong> (here, whether the list of players contains this player's name). 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sequencing</strong> means that the computer carries out the instructions in the order in which they appear in your code.</li>
