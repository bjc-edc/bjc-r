        <div class="todo"><h2>Brian wants to tell them to start a journal early in the course (e.g., here) with things like: "Describe the bug: what went wrong, how did you find it? how did you fix it?" etc. Then, we can have them "writing" things in their journal. --MF, 3/13/19</h2></div>

            <p>Teacher feedback from 2017-2018: one teacher noted that the Greet part of the lab went more smoothly than the Gossip section. Another noted that the supplemental explanations helped a lot for some blocks, but students still struggled when what the characters said did not make sense. The trickiest element was making the blocks (e.g. how to use the Gossip Response Block, making blocks as commands or reporter blocks). Other challenges included how to find the bugs when placing blocks together incorrectly, lists (one teacher felt it was too early to introduce), the actual code (one teacher modified to be a fixed instead of an infinite conversation), the asking of the user, time to develop adequate familiarity with Snap!, and creating phases. --MF, 3/6/19</p>

                    <li>Al's "ruthless comment" is right. Yes, costumes /are/ fun, and kids should (somewhere) learn about them, but we should treat them as decoration, embellishment, polish, not core. And, frankly, our images here are (in my mind) pretty demeaning. Way-obviously middle-school kids and (to my mind at least) a bit too stereotyped. When we do get to costumes, why not have /our/ images be totally neutral (the initial stupid dart costumes) and teach kids how to change them to whatever /they/ want to pick, rather than showing them what /we/ think they want to see us having picked?</li>
                    <ul><li>Ok, I've commented out the ITITs and made the pink box image a static graphic of two drawings instead of two arrows (at BH's suggestion). Brian also suggests having these costumes built into the starter project, ok? --MF, 4/6/19</li></ul>
                    <li>We're getting too didactic too soon. The orange box is really important, but not at this stage. We're answering a question students are not likely to have yet. They have a working program. Their job (our PURPOSE) is to use, then modify, then create. Theorize comes later. I'd be happier seeing them add structure -- can you get Sprite(2) to tell Sprite to talk? -- than if they waste time on costumes that /we/ tell them to change. Let them embellish without us telling them to. Find out by experimenting, what these blocks do. Then, move right on to the content of page 2, editing, then create.  Use, modify, create.  /Then/ embellish and theorize.</li>
                    <ul><li>I've moved the orange box to page 2 where it is now a hinted yellowbox, and I added an ITIT: "Make Sprite(2) to tell Sprite to respond. What happens?". --MF, 4/6/19</li></ul>
