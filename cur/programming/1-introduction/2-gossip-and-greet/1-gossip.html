                <li>I know it’s an ITT, and it’s fun, but kids will want to play with costumes, and this is a time sink. Keep the use of costumes to a minimum.</li>
                <ul><li>That's not a good reason not to have it as far as I'm concerned. That's for the teacher to manage. I'd be ok to put a note in the TG saying that this might engage students and they might want to manage how much students engage with this (like any) particular idea that interests them. How's that instead? --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>

            <p>Teacher feedback from 2017-2018: one teacher noted that the Greet part of the lab went more smoothly than the Gossip section. Another noted that the supplemental explanations helped a lot for some blocks, but students still struggled when what the characters said did not make sense. The trickiest element was making the blocks (e.g. how to use the Gossip Response Block, making blocks as commands or reporter blocks). Other challenges included how to find the bugs when placing blocks together incorrectly, lists (one teacher felt it was too early to introduce), the actual code (one teacher modified to be a fixed instead of an infinite conversation), the asking of the user, time to develop adequate familiarity with Snap!, and creating phases. --MF, 3/6/19</p>

            If you do that, you can't use <code>who</code> as an input to another block such as the <code>join</code> in <code>gossip</code>. So, we have to make <code>who</code> be a <em>reporter</em> in order to use it in <code>gossip</code>:<br />
