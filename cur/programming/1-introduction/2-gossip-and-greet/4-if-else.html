        <h2>Adding Variety to <code>Gossip</code></h2>
        <div class="todo">Here is the <a href="https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/new/3-if-else.html">old version of this page</a> --MF, 4/12/19</div>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page, </strong> you will improve your program so that, <em>sometimes</em>, the sentences are a bit longer and more complex.</p>

        The block <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/more-complicated-who.png" alt="more complicated who" title="more complicated who"> has been built for you. It randomly chooses 1, 2, 3, or 4, and if that number is 3, then it reports something more complicated than <code>who</code>. Otherwise, it reports <code>who</code>, just as before.

                            Here is the script inside <code>more complicated who</code>. What change to this script will make the more complicated phrase appear more often?

                                Then three will be the randomly chosen number one out of five times instead of one out of four, and so we'll have a complicated subject less often.
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="choice" identifier="c2">

                                Correct! Three will then be the chosen number one out of three times, and so we'll have a complicated subject more often.

                            <div class="feedback">
                                Three will still be the randomly chosen number one out of four times, and we'll have a complicated subject just as often as before.

                                The chosen number can never be 5, so we'll never get a complicated subject.
