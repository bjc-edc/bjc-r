        <h2>Adding Variety to <code>Gossip</code></h2>
        <div class="todo">Here is the <a href="https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/new/3-if-else.html">old version of this page</a> --MF, 4/12/19</div>

            <p><strong>On this page, </strong> you will improve your program so that, <em>sometimes</em>, the sentences are a bit longer and more complex.</p>

        The block <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/more-complicated-who.png" alt="more complicated who" title="more complicated who"> has been built for you. It randomly chooses 1, 2, 3, or 4, and if that number is 3, then it reports something more complicated than <code>who</code>. Otherwise, it reports <code>who</code>, just as before.

                                Then three will be the randomly chosen number one out of five times instead of one out of four, and so we'll have a complicated subject less often.
