        <h2>Getting to Know the Snap<em>!</em> Interface</h2>
        <p>Naming the sections of the <em>Snap<em>!</em> </em> window makes it easy to refer to them. 
             This description is brief. You can always look up more detail, if you like, in 
 <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/SnapManual.pdf" target="_blank">the Snap<em>!</em>  manual</a>.</p>

        <h3>Palette</h3>
        <p>The <em>palette</em> contains the blocks (individual instructions) that you use 
        to tell the computer what you want it to do. The blocks are organized into eight categories according to 
        the kind of thing they do. </p>
        
        <h3>Scripting Area</h3>
        <p>You drag blocks to the Scripting Area to create scripts to control the computer. 
        The script shown here has two blocks: <code>when GreenFlag is clicked</code> and <code>say Hello!</code> </p>

        <h3>Stage</h3>
        <p>The Stage is where <strong>sprites</strong>—little on-screen robots—act out the code you write. 
        This sprite is saying "hello" because
        that is what its script told it to do when the green flag was clicked.</p>

        <h3>Sprite Corral</h3>
        <p>The Sprite Corral houses all of the sprites that you (or someone) created. 
        You start with one sprite and can create more if you like. 
        When a sprite in the Corral is selected, the Scripting Area shows what instructions that sprite understands.
        The picture here shows only one sprite in the corral. </p> 

		<h3>Tool Bar</h3>
    	<p>The Toolbar across the top of the screen has buttons for  
        the File menu <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button"/> 
        for saving and loading your projects, 
        the Cloud menu <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="Cloud button"/> 
        for accessing your Snap<em>!</em> account, 
        the Settings menu <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/settings_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="settings button"/> 
        with advanced options, 
        stage resizing buttons <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/screen-size_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="screen-size button"/> <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/full-screen_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="full-screen button"/>, and 
        project control buttons (green flag <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="green-flag button"/>, pause <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pause_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="pause button"/>, and stop <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="stop button"/>). 
        You can click on the buttons to see more about what they do. <br />
        You can also click on the Snap<em>!</em>  logo  <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Snap Logo.png" alt="Snap Logo"/>
        for more information. </p>
