        <h2>What is Snap<em>!</em> ?</h2>
        <p>Snap<em>!</em> is a language for writing computer programs. Programs are sets of instructions for the computer to follow, telling it what to do.</p>
    	<p>When the first programming languages were invented, video screens were rare, and people communicated with computers mostly through a keyboard. Because of that history, most programming languages are still written with text using a keyboard.</p>

        </a>
        <p>Snap<em>!</em> is newer: it's a visual language. Instead of writing a program  using only the keyboard, you will build the program by dragging pictures of blocks (instructions) and clicking them together.</p>

        <h2>Introduction to Pair Programming</h2>
        <p>In this course, you will use a technique that professional programmers call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" target="_blank">pair programming</a>&mdash;writing computer programs in teams of two people. One partner, the &quot;driver,&quot;  writes the program that controls the computer; the other partner, the &quot;navigator,&quot; helps plan and helps catch errors. </p>
        <p><em>Switch roles often</em>, trying for equal time in each role. That way each partner gets to understand all parts of the program, and  the person in each role remains focused. As you progress through labs in the first few units, we will suggest places for you to switch. </p>
