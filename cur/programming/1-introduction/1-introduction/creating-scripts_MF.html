        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <div class="sidenote">You can build scripts by dragging blocks out from the palette on the left and snapping them together, or just by duplicating an existing script (using two-finger-click or left-click).</div>

        		<li>If it isn't open already, click the script below to lanch it in <span class="snap">snap</span>:<br /><a class="run" href="bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/sound-sweep-up.xml"><img class="indent"src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/sound-sweep-up.png"/></a></li>

                	Guess what this code does. Do not build it yet. Discuss with your partner and perhaps another pair.<br />

        <h2>Creating Scripts</h2>
        <p>In the scripting area, you can snap  blocks together (hence the name <span class="snap">snap</span>) to build up a set of instructions, a <em>script</em>. Drag one block right underneath another to snap them together. The white bar that appears (see the picture below) shows you where the block will go when you drop it.<br />
        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/topic1_blocks_snapping.png" style="height:8em;" alt="Blocks Snapping Together"> <br />
        A <span class="snap">snap</span> program consists of one or more  scripts.</p>
    	<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <div class="sidenote">
                <div>While a script is running its border is highlighted. This one runs so quickly that you may have to look closely to notice the brief border flash.</div>
            </div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                	Create this two-block script in the scripting area. Click on it a few times to see what it does.<br />
                    <img class="indent" style="height:4em;" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-turn.png" alt="Move 10 steps then turn clockwise 15 degrees" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="sidenote">
                        <div>
                            This script takes longer to run, so it's easier to notice the highlighted border:<br />
                            <img src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/topic1_highlightedscript.png" alt="Script Running">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    Here is another script to create. Predict what it will do, and then try it out.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/topic1_justmadeascript.png" style="height:8em;" alt="You just made a script!">
                 </li>
                 <li>Modify your first two-block script so that when you click it enough times, it makes a square. </li>
                 <li>Modify it again (or build another copy) so that it can make a triangle or hexagon.</li>
             </ol>
        </div>
        <p>Blocks in a script run in a specific order, from the top of the script to the bottom. Generally, <span class="snap">snap</span> waits until one block has finished its job before continuing on to the block below it. (One common exception is blocks that play sounds: a block's job can be to <em>start</em> the sound, which means the block below it will execute while the sound is still playing.)</p>
        
        <h2>Saving Your Work</h2> 
        <p>In <span class="snap">snap</span>, your work is saved online ("to the cloud").</p>

            	<li>If it's not open already, open <span class="snap">snap</span> by visiting <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/run" target="_blank"><strong>http://snap.berkeley.edu/run</strong></a> .</li>
                <li>

                <li>To save your work, use the File button <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button"/> in the tool bar, and choose "Save" or "Save as...". <em></em>
