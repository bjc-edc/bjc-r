		<p>Programs are sets of instructions that tell a computer what to do. </p>
		<p>You have already programmed an app in the <span class="snap">snap</span> programming language by dragging <em>blocks</em> (individual instructions) and snapping them together into <em>scripts</em>. </p>
		<p>Now you will experiment with some more blocks to see what you can do.</p>
	<p><div class="sideHOM">Bookmark or write  the <span class="snap">snap</span> link. You will need it every day.</div>
