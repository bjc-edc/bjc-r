		<p>Programs are sets of instructions that tell a computer what to do. </p>
		<p>You have already programmed an app in the <span class="snap">snap</span> programming language by dragging <em>blocks</em> (individual instructions) and snapping them together into <em>scripts</em>. </p>
		<p>Now you will experiment with some more blocks to see what you can do.</p>

        
		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
				
					
				
				
				<li>
					<p>
						Build this script. <br />

						When you have built it, click on it to see what it does. 
            </li>

					Compare your work with another pair. 
                    <p>If your script behaves differently from theirs, check both.</p>
				</li>


                <li><strong>Now experiment!</strong> What happens if you...
					<ol>
						<li>Change the number in the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-50.png" alt="move 50 steps" title="move 50 steps">block and click the script to run it again?</li>
						<li>
						  <div class="sidenote">You can click <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/clear.png" alt="clear" title="clear" /> (or any  block) in its palette or in the scripting area to run it.</div> 
					    Click the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/clear.png" alt="clear" title="clear" /> block in the green Pen palette?</li>
						<li>Change the number in the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/turn-right-90.png" alt="turn right 90 degrees" title="turn right 90 degrees"> block and run the script again? And again?</li>
						<li>Change the number in the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/repeat-4.png" alt="repeat 4" title="repeat 4" /> loop?</li>
						<li><div class="sidenote">To change the pen size you must <em>click</em> the <code>set pen size</code> block after you've entered the number you want.</div> Use <span class="center"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-pen-size-to-1.png" alt="set pen size to 1" title="set pen size to 1" /></span> (in the Pen palette) to set  the pen size to something like 4 or 10 or 50? </li>

					Look back at the code that drew a square. <img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Discuss how each block contibutes to the overall behavior. <!--<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair.png" alt="Talk with Another Pair" title="Talk with Another Pair" />

					<strong>Experiment more!</strong> Create a program that draws something. Below are other blocks that you may find useful. Find them by their color coding, and click on them to see what they do.
