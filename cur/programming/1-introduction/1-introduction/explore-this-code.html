                	Guess what the computer might do when it reads this code, and discuss your thinking with your partner and maybe another pair.<br />

                	Read through this skit of two beginning <span class="snap">snap</span> programmers reading that same code:
                	<div class="dialogue"><!--dialogues shouuld either be 2 or 4 people since kids will be in pairs or talking to another pair, right?-->
        				<div><span>1:</span> Well, the computer does <em>something</em> when you press the up key.</div>
        				<div><span>2:</span> Yeah, and then it does that "for <em>n</em> equals 40 to 70" thing... whatever that is...</div>
        				<div><span>1:</span> And the next block "says" the letter <em>n</em>... out loud?</div>
                        <div><span>2:</span> Oh, and then it plays the note <em>n</em> for a quarter of  beat! That "point two five beats" is a quarter note!</div>
                        <div class="stagedir">2 points to the last block in the script.</div>
                        <!--Charcter 2 knows music-->
                        <div><span>1:</span> Cool! So, if it's playing notes out loud, then maybe for "say <em>n</em>" it just says <em>n</em> on the screen...</div>
                        <div><span>2:</span> The program decides what <em>n</em> is in that C-shaped, "for" thing.</div>
                        <div><span>1:</span> What does it mean "for <em>n</em> equals 40 to 70"?</div>
                        <!--I deliberately have each charcter reading the 'for' loop out loud. -Mary-->
                        <div><span>2:</span> Maybe it's like how if I were to plan a vacation "for August 8 to 13." It means all those days...</div>
                        <div><span>1:</span> So the computer "says" and "plays" all those numbers?</div>
                    </div>

                <li>Swap roles and read through the skit again.</li>
                <li>Click below to launch this script in another browser window (or tab). Once it's loaded, press the up key to find out what it does:<br /><a class="run" href="bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/sound-sweep-up.xml"><img class="indent"src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/sound-sweep-back.png" /></a></li>

            	<li><em>Predict</em> the effect of changing the 0.25 in the <code>play note</code> block to 0.5 or even 1. (Don't try it yet, just discuss your ideas with your partner.)</li>
                <li>
                	Now, experiment:
                	<ol>
                    	<li>In the <span class="snap">snap</span> window, try changing the number in the <code>play note</code> block and pressing space again.</li>
		                <li>Change the numbers in the <code>for</code> block, and press space again.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>Discuss your findings with your partner and maybe another pair of students.</li>
