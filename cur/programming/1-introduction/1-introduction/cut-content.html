		<h3>Get to Know the <span class="snap">snap</span> Interface</h3>
        <p>This diagram labels the sections of the Snap window: (<em>Tool Bar</em>, <em>Palette</em>, <em>Scripting Area</em>, <em>Stage</em>, and <em>Sprite Corral</em>).</p>
        <p>It also shows what a <em>script</em> and a <em>sprite</em> can look like.</p>
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/interface.jpg">
        
        
        <div class="dialogue"><!--dialogues shouuld either be 2 or 4 people since kids will be in pairs or talking to another pair, right?-->
            <div><span>1:</span> Well, the computer does <em>something</em> when you press the up key.</div>
            <div><span>2:</span> Yeah, and then it does that "for <em>n</em> equals 40 to 70" thing... whatever that is...</div>
            <div><span>1:</span> And the next block "says" the letter <em>n</em>... out loud?</div>
            <div><span>2:</span> Oh, and then it plays the note <em>n</em> for a quarter of  beat! That "point two five beats" is a quarter note!</div>
            <div class="stagedir">2 points to the last block in the script.</div>
            <!--Charcter 2 knows music-->
            <div><span>1:</span> Cool! So, if it's playing notes out loud, then maybe for "say <em>n</em>" it just says <em>n</em> on the screen...</div>
            <div><span>2:</span> The program decides what <em>n</em> is in that C-shaped, "for" thing.</div>
            <div><span>1:</span> What does it mean "for <em>n</em> equals 40 to 70"?</div>
            <!--I deliberately have each charcter reading the 'for' loop out loud. -Mary-->
            <div><span>2:</span> Maybe it's like how if I were to plan a vacation "for August 8 to 13." It means all those days...</div>
            <div><span>1:</span> So the computer "says" and "plays" all those numbers?</div>
        </div>
                    
        <h3>Saving</h3>
        <p>That didn't save your work. It just created a space for <em>your</em> work. Now, use the File button <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button"/> in the tool bar to save your work so far. <em>Give it a name that will help you remember what the project is.</em> </p>
        <p>Any time you want that work back, you will use the same button and select "Open..." to see a list of your files.</p>
        
        <h4>What is <span class="snap">snap</span> ?</h4>
        <p><span class="snap">snap</span> is a language for writing computer programs. Programs are sets of instructions for the computer to follow, telling it what to do.</p>
        <p>When the first programming languages were invented, video screens were rare, and people communicated with computers mostly through a keyboard. Because of that history, most programming languages are still written with text using a keyboard.</p>
        <p><span class="snap">snap</span> is newer: it's a visual language. Instead of writing a program  using only the keyboard, you will build the program by dragging pictures of blocks (instructions) and clicking them together.</p>
        
        <h4>Introduction to Pair Programming</h4>
        <p>In this course, you will use a technique that professional programmers call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" target="_blank">pair programming</a>&mdash;writing computer programs in teams of two people. One partner, the &quot;driver,&quot;  writes the program that controls the computer; the other partner, the &quot;navigator,&quot; helps plan and helps catch errors. </p>
        <p><em>Switch roles often</em>, trying for equal time in each role. That way each partner gets to understand all parts of the program, and  the person in each role remains focused. As you progress through labs in the first few units, we will suggest places for you to switch. </p>

            <strong>Why is this called "pen down" instead of "leave a trace"?</strong><br />
            When a robot is doing the drawing, a real pen is either <em>down</em> (touching the page) or <em>up</em> (not touching the paper). In this picture, you can see the red pen through the robot turtle's transparent green shell.<br />
