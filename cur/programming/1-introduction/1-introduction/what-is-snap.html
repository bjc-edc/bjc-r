		<h2>What is <span class="snap">snap</span> ?</h2>
        <p><span class="snap">snap</span> is a language for writing computer programs. Programs are sets of instructions for the computer to follow, telling it what to do.</p>
    	<p>When the first programming languages were invented, video screens were rare, and people communicated with computers mostly through a keyboard. Because of that history, most programming languages still use a keyboard. <span class="snap">snap</span> is newer: it's a visual language. Instead of writing a program  using only the keyboard, you will build the program by dragging pictures of blocks (instructions) and clicking them together.</p>
