            <div class="comment">JK: I liked this article when I first read it, but now I think it's too long and long-winded to be one of the first things students read. I think I'll cut it, maybe put it in the TG as an extra resource.</div>

            	<li>This article includes several examples of technologies that might affect your life in unexpected, unintended, or surprising ways. What are some of these examples? What are other examples?</li>
                <li>This article also talks about the need for people to understand and take responsibility for potentially harmful effects of the technology they develop. What are some of the challenges?</li>
                <li>The story of the motorist trapped in a traffic circle is a made up story. Write your own short, made-up article about a technology innovation gone wrong.</li>

        <h3>What are some computing innovations that have a positive impact on society? A negative impact?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As a class, brainstorm some of these computing innovations.</li>
			<div class="sidenote">As you use the Internet for research, make sure you keep track of and cite your sources.</div>
            <li>Write about several computing innovations. Identify the innovation, describe briefly how the innovation works (what it does), what problem the innovation was meant to address, and any potential problems the innovation introduces.</li>
            <li>In a group of 2-3 people, choose one computing innovation and produce a short video that explains the innovation and some of its impacts.</li>
            <li>Possible resources (not all of these are computing innovations, but many are related to computing):

        <div class="comment">Include this in TG: <strong>Looking ahead</strong><br>Next week students will form groups of 2-3, choose a computing innovation that interests them, and produce a short video that explains the innovation and some of its impacts. Eventually, students will use this experience to help them with their AP CS Principles Explore Task, about implications of computing innovations.</div>
