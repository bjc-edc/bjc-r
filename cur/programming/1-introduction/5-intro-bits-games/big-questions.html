        	<li>JK: Put the big questions on the main page as titles.</li>
            <li>From Dan in NY: "We talked briefly about how to teach the social implications (i.e., how to engage students in meaningful discussions, where only a few dominate and most are silent). Here was the result of that brainstorm (mostly from Sam, who said he had lots of experience):

* Think, pair, share
* Start by writing
* As a particular student what they thought about another’s response
* Encourage leadership (speak to the star, vocal participants and praise them for participating, and tell them it’s their job to encourage others to speak too, allow them to feel ownership of the class and the learning community)
* Give “Pablo points” (positive rubs) for participation
* Use techniques from Danielson’s “accountable talk”
* Make sure they cite what they’re saying
* Encourage them to respect what each other is saying
* Have them do role playing “Ok, you’re a Google executive and you’re a privacy advocate — argue your side of the data collection debate”
