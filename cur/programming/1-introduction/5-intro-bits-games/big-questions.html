    	<h2>Big Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
        <ul>
        	<li>JK: Put the big questions on the main page as titles.</li>
            <li>From Dan in NY: "We talked briefly about how to teach the social implications (i.e., how to engage students in meaningful discussions, where only a few dominate and most are silent). Here was the result of that brainstorm (mostly from Sam, who said he had lots of experience):
            	<ul>
                	<li>Think, pair, share</li>
                    <li>Start by writing</li>
                    <li>As a particular student what they thought about another’s response</li>
                    <li>Encourage leadership (speak to the star, vocal participants and praise them for participating, and tell them it’s their job to encourage others to speak too, allow them to feel ownership of the class and the learning community)</li>
                    <li>Give “Pablo points” (positive rubs) for participation</li>
                    <li>Use techniques from Danielson’s “accountable talk”</li>
                    <li>Make sure they cite what they’re saying</li>
                    <li>Encourage them to respect what each other is saying</li>
                    <li>Have them do role playing "Ok, you’re a Google executive and you’re a privacy advocate — argue your side of the data collection debate"</li>
                </ul>
			</li>
            <li>JK: Interesting article: <a href="https://www.bof.nl/2015/06/26/demystifying-the-algorithm-who-designs-your-life/" target="_blank">Demystifying the Algorithm: who designs your life?</a> 7/06/15 12:45 PM</li>
			<li>From GH: A page with a lot of readings is hard to follow. All the links open in the same window so there's no easy way to go back. You can get distracted. Also doing all the reading in one page makes the pacing of the lab a bit weird -- one page usually conveys a similar amount of work but this psge iis long in comparison.</li>

		<h3>What <em>are</em> some social implications of computing?</h3>
        <ul>
        	<li>What are some of the ways computers affect your life?</li>
            <li>What are some computing innovations that have a positive impact on society?</li>
            <li>What are some computing innovations that have a negative impact?</li>
        </ul>
