		<div class="sidenote">One good way to find out what a block does is to click on it and try it out.</div>
    	<p>
        	Oval-shaped blocks like <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-args.png" alt="pick random () to ()" title="pick random () to ()" /> can <em>report</em> their values as inputs to other blocks. To use an oval-shaped block that way, drag it into the blank input slot in another block. <br />

			<ol>
                <div class="sidenoteBig">If you want to know more about what a block does, you can right-click it (or control-click on a Mac) and choose "help..."</div>
                <li>Add blocks so that every time Alonzo is clicked it not only turns, but also moves to a random position (between -190 and 190 in the <em>x</em> direction and between -130 and 130 in the <em>y</em> direction). Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-args.png" alt="pick random () to ()" title="pick random () to ()" />  and <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-0-0.png" alt="go to x=0 y=0" title="go to x=0 y=0"/> blocks togther at the end of your script to do this.</li>	   
				<div class="endnote">The Snap<em>!</em> stage (the white space in the upper right where all of the stuff happens) is just like a coordinate plane in math class. The <em>x</em> axis goes from -190 to 190, and the <em>y</em> axis goes from -130 to 130. </div>
                <div class="sidenote">Clicking the green flag is one way to start a Snap! program. You can stop the program by clicking the red stop sign. </div>
			    <li>Have Alonzo move to (190, -130) and <code>say</code> a welcome message whenever the green flag at the top right, <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button"/>,  is clicked. </li>
			    <p>The message should also tell the user to click on Alonzo and then  disappear when the user clicks. </p>
				<div class="endnote">In Snap<em>!</em>, two scripts can run simultaneously. You now have one script that runs when you click on Alonzo, and one that runs when you click on the green flag. </div>
			</ol>

    <hr />

    <div class="sidenote">Scripts run their blocks from top to bottom. Clicking on any script  runs the script, but you want <em>this</em> script to run when you click <em>on Alonzo.</em></div>
	<p>Using the <code>Say</code> block with a blank input will get Alonzo to say nothing.</p>
    
    <hr />
    
    
    <li>Have Alonzo move by itself to a new random position every 2 seconds.</li>
