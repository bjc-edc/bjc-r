        <h3>Step 2: Make Alonzo move to a random spot when clicked</h3>
    <p>Now, <strong>add blocks so that every time Alonzo is clicked it moves to a random position</strong> (between -190 and 190 in the <em>x</em> direction and between -130 and 130 in the <em>y</em> direction).</p>
    <p>Oval-shaped blocks like <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-args.png" alt="pick random () to ()" title="pick random () to ()" /> can <em>report</em> their values as inputs to other blocks. To use an oval-shaped block that way, drag it into the blank input slot in another block.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>One good way to find out what a block does is to click on it and try it out. </p>
    <p>Also remember that you can right-click on it (control-click on a Mac) and choose "help..."</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Welcome the visitor by having Alonzo say a message</h3>
    <!--<p>Up until now, you've been the player of the game, so you've known what to do. It would be good to tell the user how to play the game.</p>-->
    <p>Have Alonzo <strong>move to (190, -130) and say a welcome message whenever the green flag <img src="file:///Macintosh HD/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/hourofcode/Flag-and-stop-sign.png" alt="green flag and stop sign" /> is clicked</strong> (the green flag is at the top right, above Alonzo and below the "Next" button). </p>
    <p>The message should also <strong>tell the user to click on Alonzo</strong> and then <strong> disappear when the user clicks.</strong> </p>
    
    <hr />
    
    <p>Using the <code>Say</code> block with a blank input will get Alonzo to say nothing.</p>
    <p>Clicking the green flag is one way to start a Snap! program. You can stop the program by clicking the red stop sign. </p>
    <p>In Snap<em>!</em>, two scripts can run simultaneously. You now have one script that runs when you click on Alonzo, and one that runs when you click on the green flag. </p>

     <h3>Step 4: Make Alonzo move by itself if it's not clicked in time</h3>
    <p><strong>Have Alonzo move by itself to a new random position every 2 seconds.</strong></p>

    <!-- <p>When a script (maybe the one starting with <code>When I am clicked</code> hat block) is running and that hat block is triggered again while the first time is still running, the first one stops and is forgotten. So, if the script were going to say "Snap<em>!</em>" slowly, and it got interrupted twice, it might say "Sn-Sn-Snap!". </p> <div class="comment">This is unnecessary. If a person does click twice, they'll discover it, and it's not needed or useful here.</div> -->

        <p>Scripts run their blocks from top to bottom. Clicking on any script  runs the script, but you want <em>this</em> script to run when you click <em>on Alonzo.</em></p>
