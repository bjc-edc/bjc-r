		<p>In Snap<em>!</em>, a sprite can have more than one script controlling its behavior. You currently have just one script, which runs when you click on Alonzo. Now you'll make a second script that runs as soon as the green flag is clicked to welcome the player to your game with a message from Alonzo. </p>
        <div class="endnote">Clicking the green flag, <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button"/>, is one way to start a Snap! script. You can stop all running scripts by clicking the red stop sign, <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="stop button"/>. </div>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
    		<ol>
			    <div class="sidenote">Hint: You can do this using just 3 blocks!</div>
                <li>Create a second script that makes Alonzo move to (190, -130) and <code>say</code> a welcome message (like, "Welcome to my Hour of Code project! Keep clicking me if you can!") whenever the green flag at the top right, <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button"/>, is clicked. </li>
			    <li>
                	Make that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo. 
                	<div class="endnote">Using the <code>Say</code> block with an empty input will get Alonzo to stop saying whatever he's saying.</div> 
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Where should the <code>Say</code> block go?
                </li>
                <li>
                	Check that your app does everything you intend it to do:
                	<ul>
                    	<li>When the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should move to (190, -130) and say a welcome message.</li>
                        <li>When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage and face the other way.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
 			</ol>

        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
            <ol type="A">
                <li>If you have extra time, add code so that after the first time Alonzo is clicked, every two seconds he moves to a random position but does <em>not</em> face the other way.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="4">
                <li>
                	Now load the app on your mobile device:

                    	<div class="sidenote">You can also make a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/" target="_blank">tinyurl</a> for your game to make typing the URL easier.</div>
                        <li>In Snap<em>!</em> on your computer, save the project. Then, choose "Save as,.." from the File menu, select the file "U1L1-HourofCode", and click "Share".</li>
                        <li>Then, say "Yes" you want to publish, and copy the URL from above your browser window.</li>
              			<li><strong>On an Apple iOS device:</strong>
 <ol type="i">
              <li>On your mobile device, open the project URL in Safari.</li>
