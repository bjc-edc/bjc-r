		<p>In Snap<em>!</em>, two scripts can run simultaneously. You currently have one script that runs when you click on Alonzo. Next, you'll make a second script that runs as soon as the program starts (when the green flag is clicked) to welcome the player to your game with a message from Alonzo. </p>
        <div class="endnote">Clicking the green flag, <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button"/>, is one way to start a Snap! program. You can stop the program by clicking the red stop sign, <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="stop button"/>. </div>

                <li>Create a second script that makes Alonzo move to (190, -130) and <code>say</code> a welcome message (like, "Welcome to my Hour of Code project! Keep clicking me if you can!") whenever the green flag at the top right, <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button"/>, is clicked. </li>

                	Make that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo. 
                	<div class="endnote">Using the <code>Say</code> block with a blank input will get Alonzo to say nothing.</div> 
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Where should the <code>Say</code> block go?

                	<ul>
                    	<li>Then the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should move to (190, -130) and say a welcome message.</li>
                        <li>When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage and face the other way.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>If you have extra time, add code so that every time Alonzo is clicked, it moves to a different random position by itself if it's not clicked in time.</li>
