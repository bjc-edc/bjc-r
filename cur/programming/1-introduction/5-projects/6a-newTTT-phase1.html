        <h2>Tic Tac Toe Phase 1 (Teacher's Choice)</h2>
        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/TTT1_img/TTTDraw.png"  height="200" alt=""/><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/TTT1_img/TTTWin.png" height="200" alt=""/><br>
        
        <p><strong>Tic Tac Toe Phase 1</strong>: You will create the basic <em>Human versus Human</em> game where the computer simply takes care of displaying the X’s and O’s and the users themselves decide on a win or a draw.   Playing with the final product will feel a lot like two players playing the game with paper and pencil.  In this phase, you will create the TTT board by <em>cloning</em> a clickable square sprite with three costumes: Empty, X and O.</p>

<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>Play with <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=selimtezel&ProjectName=TicTacToe_Phase1&hideControls" target="_blank">this example</a> to get a feel for the Phase 1 version of TTT. </li>

<li>Open this <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/U1L6-TTT-phase1-student.xml" target="_blank">starter project</a> to begin your Phase 1 TTT.  A sprite, named <code>Square</code>, has already been created for you with three costumes: Empty, X and O.<br>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p> You will be using the cloning feature in Snap<em>!</em> to create the 3X3 TTT board as it is a speedier alternative to creating and keeping track of 9 separate sprites: <code>Square1, Square2, … Square9</code>.</p> 

<div class="sidenote"> Study <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=selimtezel&ProjectName=CloningExample" target="_blank">this example</a> file to gain some experience with the basics of cloning in Snap!.</div>

<div class="forYouToDo" id="second">
<ol start="3">
 <li>Create a new sprite called <code>Board</code> and use it to build the TTT board with clones of <code>Square</code> using the following blocks. <br>
   <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/TTT1_img/CreateCloneOf.png" width="243" alt=""/><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/TTT1_img/TellSquare.png" width="131"  alt=""/><br>
These blocks do not appear by default in your Control menu but you can import them via the File menu’s Import tools option.<br>
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/TTT1_img/ImportTools.png"  height="250" alt=""/>
</li>
 </ol>
 </div>


<p>To build the TTT board you may find the following blocks helpful:</p>
<div class="sidenote">The <code>warp</code> block can be used to draw the board all at once rather than square by square.</div>

<div class="forYouToDo" id="second">
<ol start="4">
<li>Experiment until you can position the <code>Square</code>’s clones correctly on the stage building the board row by row without overlap.<br>
    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/TTT1_img/Row1.png"  height="100" alt=""/><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/TTT1_img/Row2.png"  height="100" alt=""/><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/TTT1_img/Row3.png"  height="100" alt=""/><br></li>
<div class="endnote"> After cloning 9 times to create the board, <code>hide</code> the original <code>Square</code> so it does not interfere with the game as a 10th square.  Be sure to <code>show</code> the original <code>Square </code>initially, as it will be hidden by a previous run and thus its clones will not be visible.</div>

<li>By default, each <code>Square</code> clone should have the Empty costume.  Now create code that will allow each <code>Square</code> clone to put on the proper costume when clicked: X or O depending on whose turn it is. Also think, how should a square behave when it is clicked while already wearing an X or O costume.
<br>
(Hint:  If you keep track of the number of moves made so far with a variable named <var>counter</var>, you will be able to use the oddness/evenness of this count to determine whose turn it is.  You can use the <code>mod</code> block to in the Operators menu to determine oddness/evenness.)  

<div class="endnote"><code>mod</code> function gives the remainder when the first input is divided by the second.  For example, 6 mod 2=0 as 6 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 0. And, 7 mod 2 =1 as 7 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1. Thus, you can use a number mod 2 to determine if it is odd or even. </div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>You may find the following blocks useful while writing the code for the <code>Square</code>.</p>

You are now ready to pursue Phase 2 and Phase 3 of TTT.
<ol type="A">
<li><strong>Phase 2</strong>: <em>Human versus Human</em> game where the computer decides on a win or a draw.  In this version, the computer starts gaining awareness of the game and begins to meaningfully contribute to the game. <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=selimtezel&ProjectName=TicTacToe_Phase2a&hideControls" target="_blank">TTT Phase 2 example</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Phase 3</strong>: <em>Human versus Computer</em> game where the computer not only decides on a win or a draw but it also has some AI (Artificial Intelligence) features that allow it to “think” about a proper next move and simulate the moves of an intelligent human opponent. <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=selimtezel&ProjectName=TicTacToe_Phase3&hideControls" target="_blank">TTT Phase 3 example</a>.<br><br>
