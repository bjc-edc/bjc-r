<p>In this series of Tic Tac Toe projects, you will build three versions of the game, each version making the computer’s involvement in the game more intelligent than the version before:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/5-projects/6a-newTTT-phase1.html">Phase 1</a></strong>: Basic <em>Human versus Human</em> game where the computer simply displays the X’s and O’s but the users themselves decide on a win or a draw.   This version will be a lot like two players playing the game with paper and pencil.  <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=selimtezel&ProjectName=TicTacToe_Phase1&hideControls" target="_blank">TTT Phase 1 example</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Phase 2</strong>: <em>Human versus Human</em> game where the computer decides on a win or a draw.  In this version, the computer starts gaining awareness of the game and begins to meaningfully contribute to the game. <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=selimtezel&ProjectName=TicTacToe_Phase2a&hideControls" target="_blank">TTT Phase 2 example</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Phase 3</strong>: <em>Human versus Computer</em> game where the computer not only decides on a win or a draw but it also has some AI (Artificial Intelligence) features that allow it to “think” about a proper next move and simulate the moves of an intelligent human opponent. <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=selimtezel&ProjectName=TicTacToe_Phase3&hideControls" target="_blank">TTT Phase 3 example</a>.<br><br>

<strong>Note</strong>: In the last version, even though the computer will be aware of the nuances of the game, it will <strong>not</strong>  be unbeatable.  As an extension activity, you will be encouraged to develop an AI that is unbeatable at Tic Tac Toe.  Such AI, while fun to code, will not be so much fun to play against.</li>

</ul>

<b>Note to the teachers in TG:</b><br>
<p>Based on the feedback we received from previous years, this year we have simplified the TTT project greatly so that all the tedious math is gone and the programmers can focus on the game itself and explore more interesting avenues for the game such as developing an AI player.  In this new version of the TTT, the squares of the TTT board are <strong><em>click-conscious </em></strong> sprites, thus eliminating the need for extensive mathematical computations.  Even though the TTT series of projects are “Teacher’s Choice” (optional), we hope that you and your students will take on the challenge of creating something quite profound like AI at this first course in Computer Science.</p>
