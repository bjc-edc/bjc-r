		<h2>Exploring <span class="snap">snap</span> Code</h2>
			<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/work-with-a-partner.png" alt="Work with a Partner" title="Work with a Partner" /></p>
		<p>You have already programmed an app in the <span class="snap">snap</span> programming language. </p>
        <p>Programs are sets of instructions that tell a computer what to do. </p>
        <p>In <span class="snap">snap</span>, you program by dragging blocks (individual instructions) and snapping them together into scripts. </p>
		<p>For now, you will experiment with some more blocks that <span class="snap">snap</span> provides, to learn what they do. </p> 
        <p>Soon, you will create your own blocks of code, blocks that <span class="snap">snap</span> doesn't have.</p>

					<p>
						Build this script. <br />

					<img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair.png" alt="Talk with Another Pair" title="Talk with Another Pair" />
					Compare your work with another pair. 
                    <p>If your script behaves differently from theirs, check both.</p>
				</li>


                <li><strong>Now experiment!</strong> What happens if you...?
					<ol>
						<li>Change the number in the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-50.png" alt="move 50 steps" title="move 50 steps"> block and click the script to run it with that new number.</li>
						<li>
						  <div class="sidenote">You can click <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/clear.png" alt="clear" title="clear" /> (or any  block) in its palette or in the scripting area to run it.</div> 
					    Click the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/clear.png" alt="clear" title="clear" /> block in the green Pen palette?</li>
						<li>Change the number in the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/turn-right-90.png" alt="turn right 90 degrees" title="turn right 90 degrees"> block and run the script again... and again... and again.</li>
						<li>Change the number in the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/repeat-4.png" alt="repeat 4" title="repeat 4" /> <code>repeat</code> block.</li>
						<li><div class="sidenote">To change the pen size you must <em>click</em> the <code>set pen size</code> block after you've entered the number you want.</div> Use <span class="center"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-pen-size-to-1.png" alt="set pen size to 1" title="set pen size to 1" /></span> (in the Pen palette) to set  the pen size to something like 4 or 10 or 50? </li>

					<strong>Experiment more!</strong> Invent some design of your own. Below are other blocks that you may find useful. Find them by color, and click on them to see what they do.

                <li>Try the <code>repeat (move, turn)</code> script that you first made, but with <em>tiny</em> turns (1 or 2 degrees) repeated <em>many</em> times. Adjust the size so that your drawing fits on the stage.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Create a script that  draws a blue square of size 100 and then draws a red circle that fits perfectly inside it.
