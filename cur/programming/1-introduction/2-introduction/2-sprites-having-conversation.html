<div class="todo">This lab is written all as one page. It should be broken into at least two, possibly three.</div>
		<h2>Sprites Having a Conversation</h2>
        <div class="comment">Give instructions to import the U1 tell block before starting this project and <em>save</em> this project as Dialogues.</div>
        <p>In this lab, you will program <em>two</em> sprites. <br /> 
    One sprite will follow your mouse. <br />
        The other sprite will chase the first. <br /> 
        When they meet, they will have a short conversation.</p>
        <p><div class="newProject"><span class="text">"U1L2-SpriteChaseConversation"</span><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/new-project-called.png" alt="Create a new project called U1L2-SpriteChaseConversation" title="Create a new project called U1L2-SpriteChaseConversation" /></div>
          <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" />
        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
            <li><div class="sidenoteBig"><img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-x.png" class="block" alt="Mouse X Reporter"/> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-y.png" class="block" alt="Mouse Y Reporter"/> report the mouse's location on the screen. You can find them in the &quot;Sensing&quot; palette.</div> 
            Read and think about this script before you build it. What do you expect it to do?
              <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/follow-that-mouse.png" alt="Follow That Mouse Script"></p>
            <p>Now build the script.</p>  <div class="sidenote">To <em>stop</em> this script, click the red stop sign <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="stop button"/>. </div>
            <p>Move your mouse around the stage while the program is running. Does the program work the way you expected?</p></li>
			  <li>Now create a second sprite. The video shows how. <br /> The instructions below the video describe the steps.
                  <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/NewSprite-pointing-to-old-sprite-PART1.gif" alt="getting a new sprite"></p>
                  <ol>
                        <li>Click on the &quot;add a new Turtle sprite&quot; button just below the stage. <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Add-a-new-turtle-sprite.png" alt="add a new turtle sprite"></li>
                        <li>That new sprite appears on the stage and a button to select it and its script appears underneath the stage. Right now, it has no script. You will need to drag in blocks to tell it what to do.</li>
                        <li> <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /> If you want to see any sprite's script, click on its button below the stage. </li>
                  </ol> 
              </li> 
              <li> Build a script for Sprite(2): <br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <code>when green flag clicked</code> <br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <code>forever [point towards Sprite] </code> <br />
              The video shows how.<br /> 
              The instructions below explain a bit more.
                  <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/NewSprite-pointing-to-old-sprite-PART2.gif" alt="part 2"></p>
                  <ol>
                        <li> <div class="sidenoteBig">
						While a script is running, its border is highlighted. Some scripts run so quickly that you may not notice the brief border flash. This script takes longer to run, so it's easier to notice the highlighted border.
					         </div>
                    When the green flag is clicked, <em>both</em> sprites' scripts run.
                            <ul> 
                              <li>Sprite always follows your mouse, as you taught it to.</li>
                              <li>Sprite(2) always points toward Sprite.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /> Click the green flag and try it yourself.</li>
                  </ol>
              </li>
              
              <li>We don't want the sprites to repeat their movements forever. <br /> We want them to <code>repeat until</code> they touch each other, and then stop.<br /> 
              The video shows how to change <code>Sprite(2)</code>'s code. <br /> 
              <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Replacing-code.gif" alt="Replacing code"><br /> Do that for <code>Sprite(2)</code>. <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /></li>
              
              <li>Now go back to <code>Sprite</code> and tell it  to follow your mouse <em>only</em> until <code>touching Sprite(2)</code>.</li>
              
              <li> <div class="sidenoteBig">When the green flag is clicked, you should be able to move the gray Sprite, and watch Sprite(2) keep facing it until you bring Sprite close enough for the two to touch.</div> Try out your program. </li>
              
              <li>Sprite(2) <em>faces</em> Sprite, but doesn't move. Add a line of code so that Sprite(2) chases Sprite.<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <code>repeat until touching</code> <br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <code>point towards Sprite</code> <br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <code>move a tiny amount</code> <br />
              You may want each move to be even less than 1 step so that Sprite(2) doesn't catch Sprite too quickly.</li>
              <li>Test your program! Test it a few times. <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap-mini.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" />  </li>
              <li>Right now, when they do meet, they just stop. <br />
              Make them have a conversation when they stop. <br />
              You can do that by adding code like this to Sprite(2)'s script. <div class="sidenote">This code leaves <code>Sprite(2)</code> in charge of <code>Sprite</code>. Sprite(2) does things itself, and also tells Sprite what to do and when to do it. </div> <br />
              Make up your own dialogue. You can use any language you can type. <br />

    <div class="takeItFurther">
      <p> You can make this more interesting in lots of ways, if you like.</p> 
          <ol type="A">
              <li>You can give the sprites costumes. You can even use a photograph or picture from the Internet by dragging the picture into the costume area for that sprite. If the picture you choose is too big, set its size <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-size.png" alt="set size"> to something less than 100%. </li>
              <li>You can make a dialogue about school or home or work or play. </li>
              <li>You can add a third sprite and have it do something, too.</li>
              <li>You can even change the background on the stage.
