    	<h2>Building Tic Tac Toe and Other Board Games</h2>
    	In this lab, you will begin building a new game app to play Tic Tac Toe and other games. 
		<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Simpler-TicTacToe-video.gif" width="312" alt="Tic Tac Toe video"><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Rani-game.gif" width="315" alt="Rani's game"> <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/SudokuBoard.png" width="306" alt="sudoku board"></p>
        <p>The game <em>rules</em> vary, but the game <em>boards</em> are alike except for the   number of tiles. It makes sense to write one program for all three boards. For example, it would be nice if  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/draw-n-by-n-board(3).png"  alt="draw-n-by-n-board(3)"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/draw-n-by-n-board(5).png" alt="draw-n-by-n-board(5)">  should draw these boards, fitting neatly on the stage:</p>

                <li>
        			First, <a href="../3-building-blocks/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/U1-TicTacToe.xml" class="run">load this file</a>. It has two costumes and one brief script.   
                    <ul>
                        <li>Experiment by dragging the sprite around the stage to see what the script does.</li>
                        <li>While you do the other work on this project, feel free to disable this script and choose the plain "turtle" (arrow-head) costume if you like. You won't need this script until later.</li>
                        <li><code>Clear</code> the stage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You won't yet create <code>draw n-by-n board</code> block. The task is complex, so <em>start</em> by build blocks that specialize in each part of the task. For example, you might:
                    <ol> 
                        <li>
                            Build <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/tile(size).png" alt="tile of size (size)"> to make a single square tile. You can use your <code>square</code> block inside it, if you like.
                            <div class="takeNote">
                                <p>
                                	<strong>Abstraction: </strong> Why should you build the  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/tile(size).png" alt="tile of size (size)"> when you could just use your <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-square-block-with-empty-input.png" alt="draw square"> block? Or just <br />
									<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/rep4-move-turn.png" width="192" height="115" alt="repeat 4, move, turn">
                                </p>
								Hiding the details does <em>two</em> useful things. It makes your code easier to read. And if, some day, you decide to create the tiles differently—maybe with thicker borders or fills of random colors or by using <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/stamp.png" alt="stamp, from the Pen palette">—you can make  those changes in one logical place rather than looking all over your program to find where the change might be needed.
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>Build <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/row(tiles-size).png" alt="row of">, using your <code>draw square</code> to draw one row of  tiles, like this: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/row-of-5tiles.png" alt="row of 5 tiles"></li>
                        <li>Build <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles-3-size-100).png"  alt="nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles-3,size-100)">, using <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/row(tiles-size).png" alt="row of"> to draw as many rows as needed—the same number of rows as there are tiles in each row.</li>
                        <li>Test each block by itself before building a block that uses it.</li>
                        <li>Experiment to find where you want the sprite to start when you draw the board. Build a block <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/go-to-starting-place.png" alt="go-to-starting-place"> to set the sprite there.</li>
                        <li>Run <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles-3-size-100).png"  alt="nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles-3,size-100)"> and then calculate the right inputs to get a 5-by-5 array of exactly the same size. The combination of the two might look like this. <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/5-by-5-superimposed-on-3-by-3.png" width="150" alt="5-by-5-superimposed-on-3-by-3"></li>
                        <li>On the next page, you will learn how to get Snap<em>!</em> to do that calculation automatically, so that all boards are the same size no matter how many tiles they have.</li>                    </ol>
				</li>
                <li>Clear the screen and draw a good 3-by-3 array again. You can now use the script you started with to play a game of Tic Tac Toe.</li>
                <li>If you care, you can use your same block to create a "1-by-1 array" (just a large square) of the right size to "erase" the outside border of the 3-by-3 board to make something that looks more like a Tic-Tac-Toe board. To "erase," use  a white pencolor and a thicker pensize. </li>
                <li>Build a block that sets up the game for two people to play.  SAVE YOUR WORK!</li>
			</ol>
