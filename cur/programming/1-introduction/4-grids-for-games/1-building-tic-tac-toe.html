    	<p>
            In this lab, you'll code a general draw gameboard for Tic Tac Toe and other games, and build a simple Tic Tac Toe game.<br />

        <p>The game <em>rules</em> vary, but the game <em>boards</em> are alike except for the number of tiles. So, it makes sense to write one program for all three boards. For example, it would be nice if  <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-gameboard-with-3-tiles.png" alt="draw gameboard with (3) tiles" title="draw gameboard with (3) tiles" /> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-gameboard-with-5-tiles.png" alt="draw gameboard with (5) tiles" title="draw gameboard with (5) tiles" /> would draw these boards, fitting neatly on the stage:</p>

                <li>
        			First, <a href="/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/U1L4-TicTacToe.xml" class="run">load this file</a>. It has two costumes and one brief script.   
                    <ul>
                        <li>Experiment by dragging the sprite around the stage to see what the script does.</li>
                        <!--I editted out this aspect of the page because I found it confusing and I needed a solution to that. --MF
                        <li>While you do the other work on this project, feel free to disable this script and choose the plain "turtle" (arrow-head) costume if you like. You won't need this script until later.</li>-->
                        <li>Then <code>clear</code> the stage and <strong>create a new sprite</strong> that will draw the gameboard.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You won't create the <code>draw gameboard</code> block yet. The task is complex, so start by building blocks that specialize in each part of the task. One approach is described below. <strong>Be sure to test each block by itself before building a block that uses it</strong>.
                    <ol> 
                        <li>
                            Build <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/tile(size).png" alt="tile of size (size)"> to make a single square tile. You can use the same code from your <code>draw square</code> block.
                            <div class="takeNote">
                                <strong>Why abstraction?</strong> Why should you build the  <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/tile(size).png" alt="tile of size (size)"> block when you could just use <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-square-block-with-empty-input.png" alt="draw square"> or just the script inside it? Hiding the details does <em>two</em> useful things:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>It makes your code easier to read. </li>
                                    <li>If, some day, you decide to create the tiles differently (maybe with thicker borders, fills of random colors, or by using <code>stamp</code>), <!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/stamp.png" alt="stamp, from the Pen palette">-->you can make those changes in the <code>draw tile</code> block to change just the tiles rather than changing <code>draw square</code> which would change <em>all</em> the squares.</li>
                              </ol>
                          </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Build <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/row(tiles-size).png" alt="row of">, using your <code>draw tile</code> block to draw one row of  tiles, like this:<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/row-of-5tiles.png" alt="row of 5 tiles">
                        </li>
                        <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /> 
                        <li>Build <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-square-board.png"  alt="draw square board with () rows of tiles of size ()" title="draw square board with () rows of tiles of size ()" />, using <code>draw row</code> <!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/row(tiles-size).png" alt="row of">-->
                         to draw as many rows as needed, with the same number of  tiles in each row.</li>
						
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <!-- This didn't flow for me, and the reference to the next page is incorrect. --MF
                <li>
                	Run <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles-3-size-100).png"  alt="nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles-3,size-100)"> and then calculate the right inputs to get a 5-by-5 array of exactly the same size. The combination of the two might look like this:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/5-by-5-superimposed-on-3-by-3.png" width="150" alt="5-by-5-superimposed-on-3-by-3">
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">On the next page, you will learn how to get Snap<em>!</em> to do that calculation automatically, so that all boards are the same size no matter how many tiles they have.</div>
                </li>-->
                <li>
                	Clear the screen and draw a 3-by-3 gameboard. You can now drag and drop the first spite (the one with the "X" and "O" costumes) to play a game of Tic Tac Toe.
                	<div class="endnote">If you care, you can use your <code>draw square board</code> block to create a "1-by-1 array" (just one large square) of the right size to "erase" the outside border of the 3-by-3 board to make something that looks more like a Tic-Tac-Toe board. To "erase," use  a white pencolor and a thicker pensize.</div>
                </li>
                <li>Return to the script for the second sprite. Experiment (or calculate) to find a good starting place that centers <code>draw square board with (3) rows of tiles of size (100) </code> on the stage. Then, build <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/go-to-starting-place.png" alt="go to starting place for board" title="go to starting place for board" /> (using <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y.png" alt="go to x y">) to make it easy to move the sprite to that starting place. <strong>Add this block to your <code>draw square board</code> block definition.</strong>
                </li>

        <p>You will improve this project on the next page. In Unit 3, you will teach the computer to check for wins and illegal moves; and, still later, you will teach the computer how to be an intelligent player!</p>
