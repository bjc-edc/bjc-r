        <h2>Line Art Toy</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>In this project,</strong> you are going to simulate the famous children's toy <em>Etch A Sketch</em><sup>&reg;</sup>.</p>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/SpriteLineArt_img/SpriteArt.png" width="320"  alt="Sprite Art" title="Sprite Art"/>
        </div>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="1">
                <li>
                    Here are some things to do at the start of your program <code>when green flag clicked</code>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clear any previous drawings</li>
                        <li>Place the drawing sprite at the center of the screen</li>
                        <li>Point it in the up direction</li>
                        <li>Set the drawing pen to a color and size of your choice</li>
                        <li>Put pen down to get ready for drawing</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Write code that will clear the drawings <code>when space key pressed</code> by the user.</li>
                <li>
					The user will use the arrow keys to draw. You'll need a script for each key, starting with a <code>when key pressed</code> block:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-space-key-pressed.png" alt="when space key pressed"><br />
                    For each of the four arrow keys, make the sprite point in the direction of the arrow and then move forward 10 steps.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="endnote">Here is how Snap<em>!</em> assigns angles for directions: <br />
            <ul>
                <li>0&deg; is up </li>
                <li>90&deg; is right </li>
                <li>180&deg; is down </li>
                <li>-90&deg; (or also 270&deg;) is left</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="ifTime">
            <ol start="4">
                <li>
                    Change your code to draw only if the sprite is within the screen dimensions: -240 to 240 in the x direction (horizontal) and -180 to 180 in the y direction (vertical).
                </li>
                <li>Give your user some coloring options. For example, when the "1" key is pressed, the pen color is reset to black; when the "2" key is pressed, the pen color is set to red; etc. (Suggestion: Load the crayon library (&quot;Provide 100 selected colors.&quot;) Also consider using some keys to put the <code>pen up</code> or <code>pen down</code>.</li>
                <li>Give your user the option to draw diagonal lines. For example, write code to move the sprite at 45&deg;, 135&deg;, 225&deg;, 315&deg;, using the "w," "s," "a," and "q" keys.</li>
            </ol>
