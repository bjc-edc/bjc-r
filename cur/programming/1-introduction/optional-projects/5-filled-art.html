        <h2>Modeling Art</h2>
        <div class="todo">
        	<p>Hi Paul, I made a few edits to this page (parens in the first line of the pink box to make it easier to read; put artists in endnote as that's the sort of thing we use those for; made the UL under #1 an OL since these are ordered tasks&mdash;not choices or hints); you can also look at the diffs with github. --MF, 8/14/17</p>
            <p>
                I had some trouble with the XML file, but <strong>I made <em>no</em> changes</strong> and left the edits for you to decide about and implement:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    	Overall, there is a lot to look at when the file is opened. I would suggest:
                    	<ul>
                        	<li>Removing the second comment, "Just that code allows you to make colored squares or circles of any size." (That comment was hard to parse for me too&mdash; both the "just" at the beginning of a sentence and the "that" because it was separate from that which we are talking about.) I suggest adding the following to the bottom of the first comment attached to the first script: "This code allows you... of any size."</li>
                            <li>Removing the stray <code>set flag</code> block beside script three.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        First script:
                        <ul>
                            <li>When I tried the first script, the sprite just moved off the stage without drawing anything because the pen was not down. By the time I noticed that, it was off the stage, so I had to find and use both <code>go to x y</code> and <code>pen down</code>. Maybe you mean for them to have to do this as review? If not, I think it's a distraction from the core ideas here.</li>
                            <li>Also, this first script might clear the stage too...</li>
                            <li>Then after I did <code>go to x y</code> and <code>pen down</code> and ran the first experiment, I changed the values as specified and ran the script again. I couldn't see what happened, so then I remembered that I had to <code>go to x y</code> again, but since I had already changed the values, the line drawn back to the center showed the thick line width <em>but not</em> (when I ran the script again) the short <code>move</code> length because the sprite had already drawn a long thick line back to (0,0). That might cause kids to miss the point.</li>
                            <li>Again, <code>clear</code> would be helpful in here. Again, perhaps you want them to have to do these things, but I found it kind of distracting from the point.</li>
                            <li>Perhaps it would help to include a custom <code>reset stage</code> block with each of these scripts?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Second script:
                        <ul>
                            <li>I wonder if it might be helpful to have a few comments inside <code>tunnel</code> to help ground the code-reading. They haven't done a lot of it so far.</li>
                            <li>Also, <code>tunnel</code> is <em>not</em> state transparent. Is that intentional?</li>
                            <li>I'm not sure that editing the block will make it clear how it works. Why not "Read each line of the code and discuss how it works" and then a third list item suggesting that they "Experiment with this block by changing some of the input values inside it."?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    	Third script:
                        <ul>
                            <li>After running script 2, which leaves the pen black, this just draws a big, black, diagonally positioned rectangle going off the upper right side of the stage&mdash;not very interesting. <em>I</em> though to change the color, re-position the sprite, and try again, but I doubt kids will. Pen color could go in a <code>reset stage</code> block too.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Fourth script: I like that there are comments inside this one. That's what I wanted in <code>tunnel</code>.</li>
                    <li>"Invent your own" section: Aha! Here is the clean-up/<code>reset stage</code> script! ;) Why not either 1) make this a <code>reset stage</code> block that is already attached to each script OR 2) put this script <em>first</em> in the file so that they can use it as they are experimenting. This would have made this file so much nicer to work with! Also, I think a <code>set pen color</code> block should be included in here for when the pen gets reset to black.</li>
                    <li>I hope this is helpful. Overall, I like it. On a broader note, I wonder how much this project models how you are now envisioning the optional projects. Perhaps we could talk about that in person. Thanks! --MF, 8/14/17</li>
