    <div class="todo">Paul's comments while reviewing Selim's Scratch Proposal:<br />
    <p>But for our sake—not worth working through for your proposal—I would add that the “delighted to see how easy it is to generate exciting variations of their artworks through simple alterations of their code” is particularly apparent in the rock-bottom simplest algorithm for generating the art of Albers: square within square within square.  By simply changing the distance between squares, or the “length” of the squares (the rectangularity), or the shape of line ends (flat to round), one gets shaded triangles, “roads going off to infinity,” cylinders, tunnels, spheres, circles within circles, stacking toys.  The entire algorithm is pen down, move, pen up, move, optional color or shade change, optional size change, all repeated.  Nothing fancier than early unit 1 stuff.  It should be part of the message of unit 1, not because it is artistically motivating (though it is) but because of what you said: tiny variations in an algorithm can have profound consequences. It helps make clear what an algorithm is, because the details matter so much, and therefore need clear expression.</p>

            <p>MF: hide script experiments behind click to cut down on clutter, address comment</p>
            <p>Do we need the commented out stuff below this? --MF, 1/14/20</p>

        <!--ST these have been addressed for the most part<div class="todo">
        	<p>Hi Paul, I made a few edits to this page (parens in the first line of the pink box to make it easier to read; put artists in endnote as that's the sort of thing we use those for; made the UL under #1 an OL since these are ordered tasks&mdash;not choices or hints); you can also look at the diffs with github. --MF, 8/14/17</p>
            <p>
                I had some trouble with the XML file, but <strong>I made <em>no</em> changes</strong> and left the edits for you to decide about and implement:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    	Overall, there is a lot to look at when the file is opened. I would suggest:
                    	<ul>
                        	<li>Removing the second comment, "Just that code allows you to make colored squares or circles of any size." (That comment was hard to parse for me too&mdash; both the "just" at the beginning of a sentence and the "that" because it was separate from that which we are talking about.) I suggest adding the following to the bottom of the first comment attached to the first script: "This code allows you... of any size."</li>
                            <li>Removing the stray <code>set flag</code> block beside script three.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        First script:
                        <ul>
                            <li>When I tried the first script, the sprite just moved off the stage without drawing anything because the pen was not down. By the time I noticed that, it was off the stage, so I had to find and use both <code>go to x y</code> and <code>pen down</code>. Maybe you mean for them to have to do this as review? If not, I think it's a distraction from the core ideas here.</li>
                            <li>Also, this first script might clear the stage too...</li>
                            <li>Then after I did <code>go to x y</code> and <code>pen down</code> and ran the first experiment, I changed the values as specified and ran the script again. I couldn't see what happened, so then I remembered that I had to <code>go to x y</code> again, but since I had already changed the values, the line drawn back to the center showed the thick line width <em>but not</em> (when I ran the script again) the short <code>move</code> length because the sprite had already drawn a long thick line back to (0,0). That might cause kids to miss the point.</li>
                            <li>Again, <code>clear</code> would be helpful in here. Again, perhaps you want them to have to do these things, but I found it kind of distracting from the point.</li>
                            <li>Perhaps it would help to include a custom <code>reset stage</code> block with each of these scripts?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Second script:
                        <ul>
                            <li>I wonder if it might be helpful to have a few comments inside <code>tunnel</code> to help ground the code-reading. They haven't done a lot of it so far.</li>
                            <li>Also, <code>tunnel</code> is <em>not</em> state transparent. Is that intentional?</li>
                            <li>I'm not sure that editing the block will make it clear how it works. Why not "Read each line of the code and discuss how it works" and then a third list item suggesting that they "Experiment with this block by changing some of the input values inside it."?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    	Third script:
                        <ul>
                            <li>After running script 2, which leaves the pen black, this just draws a big, black, diagonally positioned rectangle going off the upper right side of the stage&mdash;not very interesting. <em>I</em> though to change the color, re-position the sprite, and try again, but I doubt kids will. Pen color could go in a <code>reset stage</code> block too.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Fourth script: I like that there are comments inside this one. That's what I wanted in <code>tunnel</code>.</li>
                    <li>"Invent your own" section: Aha! Here is the clean-up/<code>reset stage</code> script! ;) Why not either 1) make this a <code>reset stage</code> block that is already attached to each script OR 2) put this script <em>first</em> in the file so that they can use it as they are experimenting. This would have made this file so much nicer to work with! Also, I think a <code>set pen color</code> block should be included in here for when the pen gets reset to black.</li>
                    <li>I hope this is helpful. Overall, I like it. On a broader note, I wonder how much this project models how you are now envisioning the optional projects. Perhaps we could talk about that in person. Thanks! --MF, 8/14/17</li>
