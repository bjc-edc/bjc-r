                    Finally, use your <code>draw house</code> block together with <code>repeat until</code> to create a <code>draw row of houses</code> block that draws a row of attached houses with each new one to the right of the previous. Your program should keep drawing houses until the sprite moves too close to the right edge of the screen. For that, you will need <code>repeat until</code>.<br />
