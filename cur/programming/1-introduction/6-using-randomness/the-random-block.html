    	<h2>The <code>Random</code> Block</h2>
        <p>You can use the <code>random</code> block to generate a random number within a range defined by two whole numbers. For example, each time this block <img  title="Random" alt="Random" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-1-to-10.png" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab03/Random.jpg"> is run, it generates, with about equal likelihood, one number ranging from 1 through 10.</p>
    Like other <strong>reporter</strong> blocks, this <em>reports</em> a value that you can use inside other blocks that take an input. Here are some examples:</p>
        <img title="Random Everywhere" class="indent" alt="Random Everywhere" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/pick-random-block-inside-various-blocks.png" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab03/RandomEverywhere.gif">
        <p><a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/random/six-sided-die.xml">This program</a> simulates a six sided die that rolls every time you click on it. (You can look in the "Costumes" area&mdash;click the tab above the script&mdash;to see the six costumes that the random number is using).</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<ol>
            	<li>Make a sprite keep moving around the screen randomly, using <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-args.png" alt="pick random" /> blocks (with the correct inputs) inside <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-right.png" alt="turn right block" /> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move.png" alt="move to" /> blocks.  Some things to keep track of:
                	<ul>
						<li>You'll want to use a <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="repeat block" /> or <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png" alt="forever block" /> to keep your sprite moving continuously.</li>
         				<li>Make sure the sprite can travel in any direction.</li>
            			<li>How does your sprite's actions change if you have it move a fixed, rather than random, amount each time?  </li>
            			<li>Keep the pen for your sprite down, and you'll see a two-dimensional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk" target="_blank">random walk</a>.</li>
                        <li>Have another sprite chase that sprite but not quite catch it. It might point towards it and move more slowly or might point <em>almost</em> towards it but veer away by some random amount.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Build a script like this, and see if you can make it sound a bit more musical. <br />
