        <h2>The <code>Repeat</code> Block</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
        <ul>
        	<li>JK: Comment from EDC BJC PD day: Some teachers didn't understand the point of going through a triangle, then a square, then pentagon, etc. They said that wanted some sort of indication like "Look for the pattern" to alert them to the fact that they should be thinking that way. I'm not sure I agree 100%, but it's something to think about.</li>
            <li>JK: Teachers at this EDC PD also had issue with #7 because the code in #5 "technically" didn't provide them the answer to the 9-pointed star because there was a piece missing. They called this a "mistake" in #7 and insisted it should be fixed.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="sidenote">
        	<div>The little <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/web/external-link.png"> icon next to this script means that you can click to open it in another window.</div>

        <p>This script draws a square.</p>
        <div><a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/loop/draw-a-square.xml"> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/prog-create-square-code-BYOB.gif" alt="Square example image" title="Square example image"> </a></div>
    <div>The <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="empty repeat-n block" class="inline" /> block certainly makes the script shorter and simpler to construct, but that is not what's <em>most</em> important about it. </div>
       	<p>The structure&mdash;the logic of the script&mdash;is clearer when we see <code>repeat 4</code> (<code>move 100</code>, <code>turn 90</code>) than when we see <code>move 100</code>, <code>turn 90</code>, <code>move 100</code>, <code>turn 90</code>, <code>move 100</code>, <code>turn 90</code>, <code>move 100</code>, <code>turn 90</code>. Making the logic clear is essential for good coding for lots of reasons, including making it easier to catch bugs. In that long list, we'd have to count the parts to see if it's right and you can imagine how easy it would be to make a mistake if we were drawing a 20-sided figure instead of a 4-sided one.

      		<ol>
                <li>The three numbers in the script&mdash;4, 100, and 90&mdash;are <strong>parameters</strong> that determine the resulting behavior. Play with each number to see how it contributes to the "squareness" of the shape that is drawn. Even try using negatives of these numbers to see what happens.</li>
                <li>When you change the 4 to 40, what <em>does</em> change and what <em>does not</em> change about the picture and the way it is drawn?</li>

                    This is cute, but I don't think it's needed, and the code is too much for this early in the course. --MF

                <li>Through how many degrees did your sprite turn <em>altogether</em> (not per side) when you drew the triangle? (That is, ignore the <code>move</code> blocks and focus on only the <code>turn</code> blocks).</li>

      What number can you put into the blank numeric input of the <code>repeat</code> block below to produce the picture shown?<br/ >

		<p> It is also possible to <em>nest</em> one <code>repeat</code> block inside another. Since <span class="snap">snap</span> processes scripts from top to bottom, the first <code>repeat</code> will begin first, and the second <code>repeat</code> will have to complete its entire process before the process of the first <code>repeat</code> is called again.</p>
