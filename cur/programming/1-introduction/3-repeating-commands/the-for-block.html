        <div>Repeating a part of your program is a very common practice in programming.  We'll call this <em>looping</em>, and there many different blocks you can use to do it in many different ways.</div>
        
        <div class="alert quoteBlue">
            The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png"> block is appropriate if you want to loop the same behavior <em>forever</em>.<br />
            The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png"> block is appropriate if you want to loop the same behavior <em>a certain number of times</em>.
        </div>
        
        <div>
        	Sometimes, though, you want to do <em>almost</em> the same thing for a certain number of times, but with a slight variation. For instance:
            <ul>
                <li>You  want to draw 20 squares on the screen, but each a different size.</li>
                <li>You  want to draw 100 polygons with different numbers of sides.</li>
                <!-- any more here, yo? -->
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="sidenote">
            <div>In the current version of <span class="snap">snap</span>, the <code>for</code> block isn't installed automatically. You will need to import it once for each new <span class="snap">snap</span> project in which you use it. To do so, click on the File <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-file-menu.png" class="inline" style="height:1.7em;" /> icon at the top of the screen and select "Import Tools".)</div>
        </div>

        <div>
            Many such situations can be handled by the <code>for</code> block near the bottom of the Control palette:
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/for.png" class="imageCenter" alt="for"><br />
            The numbers in the <code>for</code> block work as you probably think they do: the inner script is run enough times to count from the left number (1) to the right number (10).  As with the <code>repeat</code> block, you can change the numbers it comes with by default to change the way the block repeats.
        </div>
        <div>
            What's new here, though, is the orange oval with <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png"> in it. By using this <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png">, your inner blocks can know which time through the loop they are currently on. Here's how:
        </div>
        <div class="alert quoteBlue">
	        The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png"> block is a <em>variable</em> that acts like a counter.  You use it any place you would use a number, and it will report the value that it currently holds.<br />
            Think of the variable like a box with a name&mdash;this one has the name <em>i</em>. This box is made for you by the <code>for</code> block, and holds a different number each time through the loop.  The first time it will hold the left number in the <code>for</code> block (1 in the block above) and it will increment by 1 from there.<br/>
            You use the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png"> block by dragging it from the source within the <code>for</code> block down to the slot in which you will use it.
        </div>

        <div>
            For instance:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/for-loop-drag-i.gif"><br />
            is the equivalent of<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/for-loop-equivalent.png">
        </div>


<!-- Former page break --MF OLD NOTE: WE REALLY NEED TO GIVE THEM A PROGRAMMING TASK, NOT THIS STUFF -->

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <div>
                <div class="sidenote">Note that we changed the name of the variable by clicking on the orange oval <em>without </em>dragging it.</div>
		        Click on the script below to load it in a new <span class="snap">snap</span> window:<br />
                <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/loop/draw-squirral.xml"> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/squirral-script.png" alt="squiral script"> </a><br />
                This shape is called a &quot;squiral&quot; &mdash; a square spiral. Do you see why it spirals outward? The length value in the  <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move.png"> varies between repetitions.
                <ol>
                    <li>Try changing the turning angle to other numbers: 92, 126, etc.</li>
                    <li>
                        Try changing the turning angle and the move length to see how close you can get to a smooth spiral:<br />
