		<h2>The <code>For</code> Block</h2>

        <p>
            The numbers in the <code>for</code> block work as you probably think they do: the inner script is run enough times to count from the left number (1) to the right number (10).  As with the <code>repeat</code> block, you can change the numbersit comes with by default to change the way the block repeats.

        <p>
            What's new to you here, though, is the orange oval with <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png"> in it.By using this <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png">, your inner blocks can know which time through the loop they are currently on.  Here's how:
        </p>
        <p class="alert quoteBlue">
            The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png"> block is a <strong>variable</strong> that acts like a counter.  You use it any place you would use a number, and it will report the value that it currently holds.<br />
            
            Think of the <em>variable</em> like a box with a name&mdash;this one has the name <code>i</code>. This box is made for you by the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/for.png" alt="for"> block, and holds a different number each time through the loop.  The first time it will hold <code>1</code>, or whatever is the left number in the <code>for</code> block.<br/>
            
            You use it by dragging <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png"> from the <i>source</i> within the <code>for</code> block down to the slot in which you will use it.
        </p>

        <p>
            For instance:

            Note that we changed the name of the variable, by clicking on the orange oval <em>without </em>dragging it.

            This shape is called a &quot;squiral&quot; &mdash; a square spiral.
            Do you see why it spirals outward?
            The length value in the  <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move.png"> varies between repetitions.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
            	<li>Try changing the turning angle to other numbers: 92, 126, etc.</li>
            	<li>
                	Try changing the turning angle and the move length to see how close you can get to a smooth spiral:<br />
