        <div>Repeating a part of your program, <em>looping</em>, is a very common practice in programming.  There many ways to do it. You have already used two of them.</div>
        
        <div class="alert quoteBlue">
            The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png"> block is appropriate if you want to loop the same behavior <em>forever</em>.<br />
            The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png"> block is appropriate if you want to loop the same behavior <em>a specific number of times</em>.
        </div>
        
        <div>
        	Sometimes, though, you want to do <em>almost</em> the same thing for a certain number of times, but with a slight variation. For instance:
            <ul>
                <li>You  want the script to tell the sprite to draw 20 squares on the stage, each square larger than the previous.</li>
                <li>You  want the script to tell the sprite to draw 12 regular polygons, each with one more side than the previous.</li>
              <!-- any more here, yo? -->
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="sidenote">
            <div>In the current version of <span class="snap">snap</span>, the <code>for</code> block isn't installed automatically. You will need to import it once for each new <span class="snap">snap</span> project in which you use it. To do so, click on the File <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-file-menu.png" class="inline" style="height:1.7em;" /> icon at the top of the screen and select "Import Tools".)</div>
        </div>

        <div>
            The <code>for</code> block (near the bottom of the Control palette) is often useful for situations like this:
      <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/for.png" class="imageCenter" alt="for"><br />
            The numbers in the <code>for</code> block work as you might expect: the <code>for</code> block counts by 1 from the first number to the second one, running the script inside the &quot;C&quot; each time.   
    </div>
        <div>
           As the <code>for</code> block counts, it also keeps track of the number with a variable, the orange oval  <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png">, which you can use in those inner blocks. To use that <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png">, drag it where you'd like it to go.
</div>

        <div>
            For instance:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/for-loop-drag-i.gif"><br />
            is the equivalent of<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/for-loop-equivalent.png">
        </div>


        
<!-- Former page break --MF OLD NOTE: WE REALLY NEED TO GIVE THEM A PROGRAMMING TASK, NOT THIS STUFF -->

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <div>
                <div class="sidenote">To change the name of the variable from <code>i</code> to <code>length</code>, click on the orange oval <em>without </em>dragging it. After you've changed the name, drag it where you want to use it.</div>
		        Build this script and try it out.<br />
               <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/squirral-script.png" alt="squiral script"><br />
                This shape is called a &quot;squiral&quot; &mdash; a square spiral. Do you see why it spirals outward? The length value in the  <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move.png"> varies between repetitions.
                <ol>
                    <li>Try switching the order of the 100  and the 1 in the <code>for</code>block. What is the result?</li>
                    <li>Try changing the turning angle to other numbers like 92, 126, etc.</li>
                    <li>
                        Try changing the turning angle and the move length to see how close you can get to a smooth spiral:<br />

                    </li>
                    <li>The example above shows a script that counts from 1 to 10. Build it and modify it so that it counts 0, 2, 4, 6, 8... up to 30.</li>
                    <li>Build a script that counts backwards from 100 to 0 by 10s (that is, 100, 90, 80, etc.).</li>
                    
                </ol>
