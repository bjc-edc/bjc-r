        <h2>Operators</h2>
        <div class="comment">But what <em>are</em> they?</div>
        <p>The Operators palette contains math blocks, logic blocks, and blocks to handle text, blocks, and even JavaScript.</p>
        <h3>Order of Operations</h3>
        <p>Because basic math operators (<img src="/bjc-r/img/python/plus.png" alt="_ + _"/>
                              <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/minus.png" alt="_ - _"/>
                              <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/axb.png" alt="_ * _"/>
                              <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/divide.png" alt="_ / _"/>) have only two inputs, order of operations depends on how the blocks are embeded.</p>
        you can use multiple operators at the same time:

        <p>tta Determine what each of these scripts will report:
        (show only the green bits)
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/setx5+(4x3).png" alt="x = 5 + 4 * 3"/>
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/setx(5+4)x3.png" alt="x = (5 + 4) * 3"/><br />
        cco Python automatically uses order of operations to evaluate expressions with multiple operators. In the example above, Python will first evaluate 4 * 3, which equals 12, and then evaluate 5 + 12. In the example above, x equals 17. If you want to change the order in Python, use parentheses:<br><br>          
        <h3>The <code>Mod</code> Block</h3>
	
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mod.png" alt="() mod ()"/> block  <em>reports the remainder</em> when the first positive integer input is divided by the second. For example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/17-mod-5-reporting-2.png"  alt="17 mod 5 reports 2" title="17 mod 5 reports 2" /> because  when 17 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When one number divides another evenly, the remainder is 0 <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/15-mod-5-reporting-0.png" alt="15 mod 5 reports 0" title="15 mod 5 reports 0" />.  So the predicate <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/n mod 2 = 0, 138 × 23 pixels.png" alt="n mod 2 = 0"/> reports <code>true</code> if <em>n</em> is divisible by 2 (i.e., if <em>n</em> is even) and <code>false</code> if <em>n</em> is odd.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In mathematical notation, we write <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/17-mod-5-reporting-2.png"  alt="17 mod 5 reports 2"> as 17 (mod 5) &#x2261 2 and we write <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/15-mod-5-reporting-0.png" alt="15-mod-5-reporting-0"> as 15 (mod 5) &#x2261 0.</p>

                <li>build <code>is () divisible by ()</code> block</li>

                	<p>Some years in our (Gregorian) calendar are "leap years." In a leap year, February has a 29th day and the year overall has 366. Leap years let the calendar adjust for the fact that it takes the earth takes slightly over 365 days to revolve around the sun. The fact that it is approximately 365.25 days means that leap year come about every fourth year.</p>
                	<!--<p>So, a year is a leap year if it can be divided evenly by 4. The year 2012 was a leap year (divisible evenly by 4), 2013 was not (not evenly divisble by 4, 2013 mod 4 &equiv; 1), 1996 was (because 1996 mod 4 &equiv; 0), and 2014 wasn't (because 2014 mod 4 &equiv; 2).</p>-->

                <li> Write a script that checks the variable <code>year</code> says "leap year" when the value of <code>year</code> is evenly divisible by 4 and says "not leap year" otherwise. </li>
                <li>Operators page: make them design a  <code>>=</code>  (<span class="snap">snap</span> we would have needed to drag out multiple blocks).</li>
