        <p>The <code>repeat</code> block makes this script shorter and simpler to construct. Also, structure&mdash;the logic of the script&mdash;is clearer when we see <code>repeat 4 (move 100, turn 90)</code> than when we see <code>move 100, turn 90, move 100, turn 90, move 100, turn 90, move 100, turn 90</code>.</p>
        <p>Making the logic clear is essential to good coding. For one thing, it makes it easier to catch bugs. In that long script (with no repeat), we'd have to count the parts to see if it's right, and it would be easy to make a mistake if we were drawing a 20-sided figure instead of a 4-sided one.

                <li>The three input numbers in the script&mdash;4, 100, and 90&mdash;determine the script's behavior. Experiment with each number, and discuss how each contributes to the square that is drawn.
