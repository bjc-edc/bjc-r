            The <code>forever</code> block is the first block you have seen that holds, or wraps around, other blocks. We call this a <strong>C block</strong> because of its shape.  As the name "forever" implies, it will run the blocks inside it again and again and again and ... well, forever. You will find this block under the <b>Control</b> tab.
        </div>
        <div>
            Will a <code>forever</code> block ever stop? Not unless you tell it to! You can click on the stop sign icon on the upper right hand corner of the <span class="snap">snap</span> window to stop all scripts that are running in any sprite.  This is equivalent to executing the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/stop-all.png" class="block" alt="stop all block"> in the "Control" palette. <br />
