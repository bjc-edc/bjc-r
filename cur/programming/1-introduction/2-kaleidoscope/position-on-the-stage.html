		<h2>Position on the Stage</h2>

        <div>
You can change the appearance of the stage to show the axes (or other backgrounds). The picture below shows the stage with axes and a grid. The background also shows the coordinates of the four points on the axes that are farthest from the origin but still visible on the stage.</div>
        <div class="sidenote">
            <div>
                To make the <span class="snap">snap</span> stage look like this:
                <ol>
                    <li>In the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-getting-started/getting-to-know-the-interface.html">Sprite Corral</a>, select the Stage.</li>
                    <li>Then, choose "Backgrounds" from the File menu <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button"/> .</li>
                    <li>And choose "xy-grid.gif".</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>
      	<div><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/snap-coord-grid.png" class="indent" alt="Coordinate Grid"/></div>
        <div>Coordinate systems for computer screens do not all work the way we expect in algebra, but <span class="snap">snap</span>&rsquo;  does. <em>Unlike</em> the common mathematical convention, the numbers naming <em>direction</em> start with 0 at the top ("north") and count degrees going clockwise. The black sprite above is pointing to the "east," so its direction is 90.</div>
        <div><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/point-in-direction.png" class="indent script" alt="Coordinate Grid"/></div>
    	<div class="forYouToDo">
      		<ol>
            	<li>Change the background on your stage so that you see the coordinates. Then experiment with your sprite to make sure you see <em>which part of the sprite</em> the coordinates are describing. </li>
                <li>What are the coordinates of the black sprite above?</li>
                <li>
                    Assemble a collection of blocks from the "Motion" and "Pen" tabs into a script that, with one click, draws a square or triangle or some other a simple picture. You will almost certainly want at least these blocks:<br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-10-steps.png" class="indent bigBlock" alt="Move 10 Steps Block"/>&nbsp;
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/turn-right-15.png" class="bigBlock" alt="Turn Right 15 Degrees Block"/>&nbsp;
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/clear.png" class="bigBlock" alt="Clear Block"/>&nbsp;
                    and <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pen-down.png" class="bigBlock" alt="Pen Up Block"/>.
                </li>
                <li>
                	This script was intended to create a pentagon, but it has bugs. Without building it, try to figure out what it does instead. Then build it and try it out. What change(s) would fix this script?<br/>
                	<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever-4.png" class="indent script" alt="penDown, forever (turn CW 10 deg, change x by 10)">
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            Useful notes:
            <ul>
                <li>Once the pen is down, it stays down even in a different script. If you want your script to move the sprite  without leaving a trace, use the <code>pen up</code> block to &quot;lift the pen.&quot; </li>
                <li>If you want, you can use <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-getting-started/sprites-reporters.html"><em>watchers</em></a> to show the direction of the sprite or its <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
