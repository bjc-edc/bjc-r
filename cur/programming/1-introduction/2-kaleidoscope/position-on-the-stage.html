		<h2>Position on the Stage</h2>

        <div>
You already know how to determine the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) coordinates of the sprite. You can, if you like, also change the appearance of the stage to show the axes (or other backgrounds). The picture below shows the stage decorated by axes and a grid. It also gives the coordinates of the four points that are on the axes and farthest from the origin but still visible on the stage.</div>
        <div class="sidenote">
            <div>
                To make the <span class="snap">snap</span> stage look like this:
                <ol>
                    <li>In the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-getting-started/getting-to-know-the-interface.html">Sprite Corral</a>, select the Stage.</li>
                    <li>Then, choose "Backgrounds" from the File menu <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button"/> .</li>
                    <li>And choose "xy-grid.gif".</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>
      	<div><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/snap-coord-grid.png" class="indent" alt="Coordinate Grid"/></div>
        <div>Coordinate systems for computer screens do not all work the way we expect in algebra, but <span class="snap">snap</span>'s  does. In the picture above, the tip of the sprite's arrowhead is to the right of the origin, so its <em>x</em> position is positive. Since it is also below the origin, its <em>y</em> position is negative.</div>
        <div><em>Unlike</em> the common mathematical convention, the numbers naming <em>direction</em> start with 0 at the top ("north") and count degrees going clockwise. The black sprite above is pointing to the "east," so its direction is 90.</div>
        <div><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/point-in-direction.png" class="indent script" alt="Coordinate Grid"/></div>
    	<div class="forYouToDo">
      		<ol>
            	<li>What are the coordinates of the black sprite above?</li>
                <li>
                    Assemble a collection of blocks from the "Motion" and "Pen" tabs into a script that draws a square or triangle or some other a simple picture. You will almost certainly want at least these blocks:<br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-10-steps.png" class="indent bigBlock" alt="Move 10 Steps Block"/>&nbsp;
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/turn-right-15.png" class="bigBlock" alt="Turn Right 15 Degrees Block"/>&nbsp;
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/clear.png" class="bigBlock" alt="Clear Block"/>&nbsp;
                    and <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pen-down.png" class="bigBlock" alt="Pen Up Block"/>.
                </li>
                <li>
                	This script was designed to create a pentagon, but it has a bug. Try to guess what it does instead. What would you change to fix this script?<br/>
                	<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever-4.png" class="indent script" alt="penDown, forever (turn CW 10 deg, change x by 10)">
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            Reminders:
            <ul>
                <li>Once the pen is down, it stays down even in a different script. If you want your script to move the sprite  without leaving a trace, use the <code>pen up</code> block to &quot;lift the pen.&quot; </li>
                <li>If you want, you can use <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-getting-started/sprites-reporters.html"><em>watchers</em></a> to show the direction of the sprite or its <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </body>
