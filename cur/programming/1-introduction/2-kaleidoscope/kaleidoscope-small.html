        <h2>Make a Kaleidoscope</h2>

        <div>
            Here is <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/drawing/kaleidoscope.xml"> a drawing program</a> to explore. (Click the link to get it.) The main part of it is <div class="sidenote">The <em>hat</em> shaped blocks, which can be used only at the beginning of a script, tell when to run a specific script.</div> <br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/follow-that-mouse-when-space.png" alt="Kaleidoscope Script"/> 
        </div>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>You've used part of this script before and know what it does. The new part is <code>when space key pressed</code>. Experiment to see what that does.</li>
                <li> Now, while you are moving your mouse over the stage, use the <strong>d</strong>, <strong>u</strong>, and <strong>c</strong> keys to control what gets drawn on the stage. Can you get the sprite to write your name?</li>
                <li> Now you get to invent a script on your own to make a (kind of) kaleidoscope, like this:<br/ >
                	<div class="sidenote"><div>One sprite is following the mouse. Three other sprites are reflecting the movement of that sprite in slightly different ways.</div></div>

                    Some useful information:
                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                        <li>You will need four sprites. One way to create the others is to <em>duplicate</em> the one you have. Right-click the sprite-button in the sprite corral, and select "duplicate" from the <em>context menu</em> that appears. Each duplicated sprite will have exactly the same scripts as the original, which is why we suggest duplication rather than just creating more sprites from scratch.</li>
                        <li>Click on any sprite in the corral to see its script. They will all be the same at first, but you want to modify three of them to change the color and create the reflections. </li>
                        <li>To change the color, click the color input in that sprite's <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-pen-color.png" class="block" alt="Set Pen to Color X Block"/>  block, choose whatever color you like, and then click on  the block itself (to run the block and actually set the color). </li>
                        <li>Pay close attention to what each of the other sprites is doing in the animation above. You will need to modify the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> inputs in each sprite's <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-0-0.png" class="block" alt="Go to X Y Block"/> block using <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/plus.png" class="block"> or <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/minus.png" class="block">.</li>
                    </ul>
            	</li>
                <li>Once you figured this out, try some other formulas and/or more sprites, and share with your classmates! Or, instead of using the coordinates of the mouse, the sprites could point toward each other and chase each other by moving a short distance (and possibly also turning, as well, so that they don't instantly crash). Experiment!</li>
                <li>You've created something on your own. Save it! The File button <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button"/> in the tool bar will let you save your project. <em>Give it a name that will help you remember what the project is.</em></li>
