            <p>PG: Jiry's predicate activity is beautiful and we should copy it for the predicate part. Mary's math page would be a great addition (pun) somewhere (not necessarily here). And I am also a fan of content over context, though perhaps not in the same way. I want to know /purpose/ which may differ from topical details.</p>

            From PG: "Vaníček’s idea is to present a simple, fairly decodable script that incorporates a decision about color based on a predicate, then a set of puzzles (e.g., the large picture at top and the two small pictures below) along with other predicates that generate them and other patterns. Task for kids is selecting (and perhaps adjusting) predicates to match the puzzles.  His script was random movement and stamp (built into make a point); ours could be that, but equally it could be what we already have, freehand drawing or pure scribbling by tracking the mouse.  What appeals to me about Vaníček’s idea is that it gives a fair amount of practice in the form of play and it highlights the part of the script that we’re focusing on by giving many variations on it.  It’s similar to what I long ago had been doing with the circle puzzles and angle, except that this is clearer." <br />

            I (Mary) wonder if this might work well as part of <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/5-follow-the-leader/1-following-sprites.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">1.5</a>. What's here (below) looks "easier" than what's in 2.3.1 (where they have to build the two-color pen script code themselves). This could serve as a nice intermediary between the intro to conditionals in <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/new/3-if-else.html">what will become 1.2.4</a> and the codification of conditionals and work building predicates in 2.3.1. --MF, 1/8/19
