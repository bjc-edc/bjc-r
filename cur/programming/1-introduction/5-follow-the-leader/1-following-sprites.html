            <p>In many programs, the visual elements on the screen need to interactâ€”follow each other, avoid each other, react a certain way when they meet each other, etc. <strong>In this lab,</strong> you will program <em>two</em> sprites. One sprite will follow your mouse. The other sprite will chase the first. When they meet, they will have a short conversation.</p>

            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will program the first sprite to follow your mouse and program the second sprite to point in the direction of the first sprite in preparation for following it.</p>

                    Read and think about this script before you build it. What do you expect it to do?<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/follow-that-mouse.png" alt="when green flag clicked{forever{go to x:(mouse x) y:(mouse y)}}" title="when green flag clicked{forever{go to x:(mouse x) y:(mouse y)}}" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now build the script and run it. Move your mouse around the stage while the program is running.
                    <div class="endnote">

                            The block at the top of the script is called a <strong>hat</strong> block.  Its shape emphasizes that it can be used only at the <em>beginning</em> of a script. Hat blocks don't say <em>what</em> the script should do; they say <em>when</em> it should do it. Hat blocks say what <strong>event</strong> should start the script running. In this case, the script starts when the green flag button is clicked.
                        </p>
                        <p>To <em>stop</em> this script, click the red stop sign: <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" style="height:1.9em;" alt="stop button" title="stop button"/> </p>

                <li> 
                    Create a second sprite by clicking on the <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/add-a-new-turtle-sprite.png" alt="add a new turtle sprite" title="add a new turtle sprite" /> button just below the stage. <a name="newTurtle" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>

                        The new sprite, named <var>Sprite(2)</var>, appears on the stage. It's brand new, so it has no scripts.  The buttons beneath the stage let you select the sprite you want to program.

                            <li><var>Sprite(2)</var> stays in one place, but always points toward <var>Sprite</var>.</li>
