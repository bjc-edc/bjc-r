	        <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will change the script so that the sprites don't move forever, but only until they touch.</p>

                    Change <strong>Follower</strong>'s code to point towards <strong>Leader</strong> only until it is touching <strong>Leader</strong>. (The following instructions show how.)
					  <ol>
                    	<li>Select <strong>Follower</strong> by clicking its button below the stage.</li>
                        <li>Replace the <code>forever</code> block with a <code>repeat until</code> block.</li>

The Control palette is open, and the programmer scrolls down and drags out the 'repeat until' block. The programmer moves 'point towards (Leader)' from 'forever' into 'repeat until' and returns 'forever' to the palette. They then change to the 'Sensing palette', drag 'touching (mouse-pointer)?' into the input slot of 'repeat until', and select 'Leader' from the 'touching?' input slot drop-down menu. The resulting script is:
when 'greenflag' clicked {
    repeat until (touching (Leader)) {

                    </ol>
                </li>
				<li>Do the same for <strong>Leader</strong>. Change its code to follow your mouse only until it is <code>touching</code> <strong>Follower</strong>.</li>
                <li>Test your program to see if it does what you want:
                	<ul>
                    	<li>When you click <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>, <strong>Leader</strong> (the gray one) should follow your mouse and <strong>Follower</strong> should keep turning to face <strong>Leader</strong>.</li>
                        <li>If you bring <strong>Leader</strong> close enough  to touch <strong>Follower</strong>, both sprites should stop moving.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                	So far, <strong>Follower</strong> <em>points </em>toward <strong>Leader</strong>, but doesn't <em>move</em> toward it.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Add a line of code to <strong>Follower</strong>'s script so that it chases <strong>Leader</strong>. Here's the idea:<br />
                            <div class="sidenote">Fill the input slot in the <code>move</code> block with a small number so  <strong>Follower</strong> doesn't catch <strong>Leader</strong> too quickly.</div>
