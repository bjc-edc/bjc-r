        	It is possible to <em>nest</em> one <code>repeat</code> block inside another. Since <span class="snap">snap</span> processes scripts from top to bottom, the first <code>repeat</code> will begin first, and the second <code>repeat</code> will have to complete all its repetitions before the first <code>repeat</code> continues.<br />

                	Build a script that draws a red triangle, duplicate it twice, and make the two new scripts draw a smaller blue triangle and an even smaller green one.

                    	<li>To duplicate a script, right-click (or control-click) on the first block of the script (in this case, the <code>repeat</code> block) and choose "duplicate".</li>

                            Then, change the inputs as the video shows:<br />

            <ol type="a">
            	<li>Make a <code>triangle</code> block with two inputs, <var>size</var> and <var>color</var>.  Use your first unnamed triangle script from problem 1 as a model.  In order to be able to have an input for the color, you'll have to use the numeric

              <li>The trouble with this definition is that, as it stands, you'll keep getting smaller and smaller triangles forever.  To prevent that, put the entire definition of <code>triangle</code> inside
