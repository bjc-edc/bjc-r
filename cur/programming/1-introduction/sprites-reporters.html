        <div>
        	At the bottom of Motion palette are three blocks shaped differently from the others. These oval-shaped blocks are called <strong>reporters</strong>.  Unlike the jigsaw-puzzle-piece-shaped <strong>command</strong> blocks we've used until now, reporters don't carry out an action (such as moving the sprite  or displaying a speech balloon) by themselves.  Instead, they <em>report</em> a value, usually for use in another block's input slot.   
        </div>
        <div>
        	The <img src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/topic1_xposition.png" alt="X Position Reporter" class="block"/> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/topic1_yposition.png" alt="Y Position Reporter" class="block"/> reporters tell you where the sprite is on the stage.  As in algebra, <em>x</em> means left-to-right position, and <em>y</em> means bottom-to-top position.

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ul>
            	<li>
                	Drag an <em>x</em> position block into the scripting area and click on it.  You should see a little speech balloon next to the block:<br />
                	<img src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/xpos-bubble.png" alt="X Position speech balloon"/>
                </li>
              	<li>Now, click on the sprite itself, drag it somewhere else and click on the <code><em>x</em> position</code> block again.</li>
              	<li>
                	Click on the gray box to the left of the <code><em>x</em> position</code> block in the palette, and then look over to the stage. You should see that the value that the block would report is displayed on the stage:
            		<img src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/palette-checkbox.png" alt="X Position block's checkbox"/>
            		<img src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/watcher.png" alt="X Position stage watcher"/>
                    This on-stage display is called a <strong>watcher</strong>.
                </li>
            	<li>Create a watcher for <code><em>y</em> position</code> and also for <code>direction</code>. Move the sprite around, using commands or just by dragging, and see how the values reported by these blocks change.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
