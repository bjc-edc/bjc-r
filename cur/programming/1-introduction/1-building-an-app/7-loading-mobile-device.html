        <p>These steps explain how to save your app to your partner's Snap<em>!</em> account and how to load the app on your mobile device.</p>

        <h3>Saving So You Can Share</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>In Snap<em>!</em> on your computer, save your project.</li>
                <li>Then, choose "Save as..." from the File menu, <strong>select the file</strong> (in this lab, "U1L1-ClickAlonzo") from the project list by clicking on its name, and click "Share."</li>
                <li>
                    Then, say "Yes" you want to publish, and copy the URL (web address) from the top of your browser window. You can <strong>use that link</strong> to share the app.
                    <div class="endnote">You can also make a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/" target="_blank">tinyurl</a> for your game to make typing the URL easier.</div>
                </li>
            </ol>
       	</div>
        <h3>Sharing with Your<a name="partner" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>Partner</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
        	<ol start="4">
                <li>
                	<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /> Log out and let your partner log in. Open the link you created with the first partner's account, and save the project in the second partner's account so that you both have a copy. 
                	<div class="endnote">Note: these are copies, not the same file. So, if you change the project in one person's account, it will not change in the other person's account; you will need to share it again.</div>
                </li>
            </ol>
       	</div>
        <h3>Loading Your App on a Mobile<a name="mobile" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>Device</h3>

        	<ol start="5">
                <li>
                	Load the app on your mobile device.

                                <li>At the bottom of the Safari screen, tap the <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/share.png" width="32" height="32" alt="share icon (square with up arrow)">share icon, then select "Add to Home Screen" from the menu that appears.</li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>On an Android device:</strong>      
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li>On your mobile device, open the project URL from step 3 above in Chrome.</li>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Now, you can open and play your game on your mobile device. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/share-your-work.png" alt="Share Your Work" title="Share Your Work" /> by emailing the URL to your friends!
