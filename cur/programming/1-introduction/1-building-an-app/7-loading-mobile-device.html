		<h2>Sharing Your App</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <ul>
                <li>GH Feedback 9/4/15: The instructions on how to load on a mobile device don't work at all. I tested it on an Android and iPhone and all you get is a generic programming GUI.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 9/4/15: The sharing-to-a-phone doesn't work for me (using Firefox on the browser, Android on the phone). The url leads to a blank Snap! screen. Is there a lag time between the app being shared, and it becoming viewable by other users? Perhaps include a debugging guide on the teacher's guide, since being able to play their creations on the phone will be a huge student motivator, and it would be sad if it didn't work!</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 9/2/15: I don't see "Share" in Snap! after I choose "Save as...".<ul><li>Maybe it would help to show where the button is? --MF</li></ul></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>These steps explain how to save your app to your partner's Snap<em>!</em> account and how to load the app on your mobile device.</p>

        <h3>Saving So You Can Share</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>In Snap<em>!</em> on your computer, save your project.</li>
                <li>Then, choose "Save as..." from the File menu, <strong>select the file (in this lab, "U1L1-ClickAlonzo") from the project list by clicking on its name</strong>, and click "Share."</li>
                <li>
                    Then, say "Yes" you want to publish, and copy the URL (web address) from the top of your browser window. <strong>You can use this link to share the app.</strong>
                    <div class="endnote">You can also make a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/" target="_blank">tinyurl</a> for your game to make typing the URL easier.</div>
                </li>
            </ol>
       	</div>
        <h3>Sharing with Your<a name="partner" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>Partner</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
        	<ol start="4">
                <li>
                	<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /> Log out and let your partner log in. Open the link you created with the first partner's account, and save the project in the second partner's account so that you both have a copy. 
                	<div class="endnote">Note: these are copies, not the same file. So, if you change the project in one person's account, it will not change in the other person's account; you will need to share it again.</div>
                </li>
            </ol>
       	</div>
        <h3>Loading Your App on a Mobile<a name="mobile" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>Device</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
        	<ol start="5">
                <li>
                	Load the app on your mobile device.
                	<ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>On an Apple iOS device:</strong>
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li>On your mobile device, open the project URL from step 3 above in Safari.</li>
                                <li>At the bottom of the Safari screen, tap the <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/share.png" width="32" height="32" alt="share icon (square with up arrow)">share icon, then select "Add to Home Screen" from the menu that appears.</li>
                            </ol> 
                        </li>          
                        <li>
                            <strong>On an Android device:</strong>      
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li>On your mobile device, open the project URL from step 3 above in Chrome.</li>
                                <li>Below the screen, tap the â˜° settings icon, then select "Add to homescreen" from the menu that appears.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Now, you can open and play your game on your mobile device. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/share-your-work.png" alt="Share Your Work" title="Share Your Work" /> by emailing the URL to your friends!
                </li>
