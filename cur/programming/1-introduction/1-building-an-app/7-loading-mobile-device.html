        <p>These steps explain how to save your app to your partner's Snap<em>!</em> account and how to load the app on your mobile device.</p>

                <li>Then, choose "Save as..." from the File menu, <strong>select the file</strong> from the project list by clicking on its name (in this lab, "U1L1-ClickAlonzo"), and click "Share."</li>
                <li>
                    Then, say "Yes" you want to publish, and copy the URL (web address) from the top of your browser window. You can <strong>use that link</strong> to share the app.
                    <div class="endnote">You can also make a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/" target="_blank">tinyurl</a> for your game to make typing the URL easier.</div>
                </li>
                Here's a video that shows how:<br />

Open the link you created with the first partner's account, and save the project in the second partner's account so that you both have a copy. 
                	<div class="endnote">Note: these are copies, not the same file. So, if you change the project in one person's account, it will not change in the other person's account; you will need to share it again.</div>
