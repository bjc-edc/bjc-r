            <ol>
                <li>Make sure your project is saved.</li>
                <li>Then, choose "Open..." from the File menu, <strong>select the file</strong> from the project list by clicking on its name (in this lab, "U1L1-ClickAlonzo"), and click "Share."</li>
                <li>
                    Then, say "Yes" you want to publish. (You can now cancel or open. It doesn't matter.) </li>
                    <li> Copy the URL (web address) from the top of your browser window. You can <strong>use that link</strong> to share the app.
                    <div class="endnote">You can also make a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/" target="_blank">tinyurl</a> for your game to make typing the URL easier.</div>

                Here's a video that shows how:<br />

Open the link you created with the first partner's account, and save the project in the second partner's account so that you both have a copy.

              <strong> Improve the game:</strong>
    		  <ol start="5">
            	<li>So far, Alonzo waits in one place to be clicked. Add code so that after the first time Alonzo jumps to a new location, Alonzo always waits 1 second and jumps again to a random position (even if not clicked).
					  <div class="takeNote"> <strong>Translating ideas into code:</strong> 
                  			<ul>
                    &quot;always...waits 1 second...and jumps again&quot;
                            <li>&quot;Always&quot; means "do it forever," and uses the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png" alt="forever">. The code that you want to repeat forever will snap <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block.</li>
                            <li>&quot;Waits 1 second&quot; uses <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" width="93" height="24" alt="wait 1 seconds">. This will go inside the <code>forever</code> block.</li>
                            <li> &quot;and jumps again&quot; uses another copy of the code you have already used for jumping. This will go inside the <code>forever</code> block.</li>
                            <li>What does &quot;after the first time Alonzo jumps to a new location&quot; tell you about <em>where</em> to attach this new bit of code to your original script? </li>
                        	</ul>
                   	</div>

                <em>The game on your phone or tablet updates automaticaly, when you improve the game and save it.</em>

                <div class="ifTime"> <br />
			       At home—or in class, if you have time—here's another idea for improving the game.</p>
                   <ol start="6">
                <li>Give  players some sense of how well they are doing:
           	  <ol style="list-style: lower-roman;">
                    	<li>Put <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghost.png" alt="change ghost effect by 5" title="change ghost effect by 5" /> in the script that runs when the player clicks on Alonzo. This makes Alonzo fade a bit each time he's clicked.</li>
                        <li>Put another block in your program to change the ghost effect by -5 any time Alonzo moves without being clicked. </li>
			      </ol>
                        <div class="takeNote">
                                <strong>Translating ideas into code: Where does the new code go?</strong> 
                          <ul>
                               <li>The <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghost.png" alt="change ghost effect by 5" title="change ghost effect by 5" /> happens when Alonzo is clicked, so it goes in the same place that you make Alonzo jump when he's clicked.</li>
                               <li>The <code>change  ghost effect by -5 </code> goes only in the place where Alonzo always moves on his own when you don't click. </li>
                          </ul>
                        </div>
              </li>
              </ol>
