    		<p><strong>In this <em>lab</em>,</strong> you'll program an app that you can share with others and play on your phone.</p>

            If you're doing this in class, you should be working with a partner. It's not just for students; professional programmers work with partners too.
            If each of you is in front of a computer, one of you should keep Snap<em>!</em> open, and the other should keep this lab page open.  If you are sharing a computer, use two browser tabs.

                This is <em>Alonzo</em>, the mascot of our programming language, <em>Snap!</em>. You should see him on the <em>stage,</em> the white area in the top right corner of the Snap<em>!</em> window.

        <p>You're going to program a game in which the goal is to click on Alonzo as he's moving around.</p>

                    As a first step, make Alonzo jump someplace else on the stage when he's clicked. Drag these two blocks into the scripting area (the center area of the window), snap them together, and make sure the correct menu options ("clicked" and "random position") are selected.<br />

        <h3>Making the Game Challenging</h3>
		<!--<div class="index-term" id="forever</code> loop" />-->
        <p>
            The game isn't much fun if Alonzo just sits there waiting to be clicked. Once you've clicked him, he should keep jumping around on his own. To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says "do this <code>forever</code>." And there is a block that does it:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever.png" alt="forever" title="forever" />
        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="4">
                <li>
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">A bunch of blocks clicked together is called a <em>script</em>.</div>
                	Attach this to the bottom of your Alonzo script:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever-jump.png" alt="forever {
    go to (random position)

                    <div class="narrower">The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you <strong>click the red stop sign</strong>, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="red stop button" title="red stop button"/>, or stop the script in some other way.</div>

                        <div id="hint-snapping" class="collapse">

                </li>
                <li>
					<!--<div class="index-term" id="wait</code>"></div>-->
                    Alonzo moves too fast. Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs" /> block to slow him down. Try your program, and increase or reduce the wait time if you like.
                    <div class="endnote">
                        Where the <code>wait</code> block goes in your script matters. Do you want the script to wait one time or each time Alonzo moves?
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>Before we go further, the next page will show you how to save a Snap<em>!</em> project so you don't lose what you've made so far. You can use the right arrow (at the top right or bottom right of this web page) to continue.</li>

        <div class="takeNote">
            <p>Orange boxes contain the ideas you should still remember three years from now. </p>

            <p>Blocks that look like this can be used to detect an <strong>event</strong> such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>). They tell the script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap<em>!</em> programmers call them "hat blocks."  Using events to control a program is called <em><strong>event-driven programming</strong></em>.</p>
	        <p>Not every script needs a hat block; you can also run a script by clicking on it.</p>
