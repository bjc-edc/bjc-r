                <li>PG: As with Lab 1, there's no avoiding of saving, logging in, etc., but that's organizational stuff, not content.  For students with teachers, we wouldn't need it here (except as a resource) at all.  For students without teachers, it must be here. So, either way, it's essential and must be here, but can we handle it differently?</li>

        <h3>Pair Programming Swap</h3>
		<img class="imageRight" style="padding: 2px;" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap">
		<p>Many professional programmers use a technique called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" title="Wikipedia: Pair programming" target="_blank">pair programming</a>&mdash;writing computer programs in teams of two. One partner controls the computer, and the other helps plan and helps catch errors. <em><strong>They switch roles often.</strong></em></p>
		<p>In this course, you will do that too. Aim for equal time in each role.</p>
