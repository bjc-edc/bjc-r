                <strong>On this page,</strong> you'll make your app more like a game. Alonzo will start to move on his own, making it harder to click him, and each time the player clicks on Alonzo, he will become a little lighter. The goal of the game is to click on Alonzo until he disappears.<br />
                <div class="comment">We should make a better video that looks clearer (my using a more dramatic change) to makes the app seem more exciting. Also, we need a 1 sec pause on both the first and last frames. --MF, 5/17/19</div>

                	To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says "do this forever."  And there is a block that does that:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever.png" alt="forever" title="forever" /><br />
                    Modify your Alonzo script so that it keeps going:<br /> 
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alonzo-code-too-fast.png" alt="when I am (clicked) {
    next costume
    forever {
        go to (random position)
    }
}" title="when I am (clicked) {
    next costume
    forever {
        go to (random position)
    }
}" />
                    <div class="endnote">The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you click the red stop sign (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="red stop button" title="red stop button"/>) or stop that script in some other way.<div class="todo">I don't think this should be yellow; maybe white? I skipped right over it and then thought, "we should add something about the stop button." --MF, 8/12/19</div></div>
                </li>
                <li>Alonzo moves too fast. Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs" /> block to slow him down. You can increase or reduce the wait time if you like.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Blocks that look like this can be used to detect an <strong>event</strong> such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>). They tell the script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap<em>!</em> programmers call them "hat blocks." </p>

            <p>Find these blocks in the yellow Control palette, and see what other choices are in their drop-down menus.</p>
	    <p>Don't think that <em>every</em> script needs a hat block.  You can also run a script by clicking on it.</p>

                <li>The command <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghosteffect.png" alt="ghost effect" title="ghost effect" /> can control Alonzo's <em>transparency</em> (how much you can see what's behind it on the stage). Drag the block into the center Scripts area, and experiment with different inputs (clicking it again after each change) to see exactly what it does.  At what ghost effect value does Alonzo become completely invisible?<div class="todo"><p>"the center Scripts area" is unclear because we've removed the diagram saying what that is. Need to provide that clarity. 1.1.2#6 is also awkward, and we might choose to address that as well, but it didn't bother me as much as this. --MF, 8/12/19</p><p>Also, we need to offer them a way to reset the brightness because just 4 clicks of that block with it's built in argument makes Alonzo disappear. --MF, 8/12/19</p></div></li>    
                <li>Then, modify your script so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little lighter.  Think about how the input you use affects the length of the game play.</li>
                <li>
                    <div class="todo">
                        <p>I think this one is tricky; "somewhere in your program" is vague. I'm going to change it to "somewhere in your script" and see if I like it better the next time I see it. --MF, 8/12/19</p>
                        <p>Have we decided whether this should be <code>change ghost effect by -5</code> <em>or</em> <code>change (</code> <var>ghost</var> <code>) effect by (</code> <var>-5</var> <code>)</code> <em>or</em> <code>change </code> <var>ghost</var> <code> effect by </code> <var>-5</var> <code></code>? We have not been consistent about this throughout the course. Here, I think it would be clearer with either the 2nd or 3rd option so you can see which characters are arguments. --MF, 8/12/19</p>
                        <p><strong>We had decided &lt;var&gt; should be for variables; that's why we colored it orange. We could add another style for constants, but then it turns into the sort of unreadable mess that makes me hate code coloring altogether.  So what I really think is that we should flush &lt;var&gt;, and if the text isn't clear, use a picture. -bh</strong></p>
                        <p>At this point, it's easy to have forgotten the goal described in the pink box. I think the question, "How does this change the game play?" is not the right thing. I think we should <em>tell</em> them: "...any time Alonzo moves <em>without</em> being clicked, so that the player can click him until he disappears," so they'll understand <em>why</em> we are asking them to do this and they'll have some shot at putting the block in a reasonable place in #5 and assessing whether their game works in #6. --MF, 8/12/19</p>

                    Put another block somewhere in your script to <code>change ghost effect by -5</code> any time Alonzo moves <em>without</em> being clicked. How does this change the game play?
