		<h2>Using the <code>Random</code> Block</h2>
    	<div class="todo">
			<ul>
                <li>GH Feedback 9/1/15: The yellow box with the grid was confusing for students. They weren't sure what to do, or if they should make their screen look like the grid. A bit more scaffolding in the "make Alonso move to a random position..." section would also have been helpful. Lots of students had questions.<ul><li>I don't know what to do about this, but I made a few little changes. --MF</li></ul></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Next, you'll add blocks so that every time Alonzo is clicked,  he moves to a random position on the stage. </p>
		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
			  <li>Find the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-1-to-10.png" alt="pick random (1) to (10)" title="pick random (1) to (10)" /> block in the green Operators palette, and click it several times to try it out.</li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> What values did the <code>random</code> block report? </li>
        <!-- <p>
        	Oval-shaped blocks like <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-args.png" alt="pick random () to ()" title="pick random () to ()" />  report  values. They can be used as inputs to other blocks.  To use an oval-shaped block that way, you can drag it into the blank input slot in another block, like this: <br />
        	<div class="comment">You've already told us, above. I've cut it considerably but this still feels a bit like talking down to the kids. It feels too late to change for this release, but this is really not writing to the spirit of <em>trying </em>things, building an app, and learning from that experience. Too much <em>explaining</em> too early. There's a whole year for that.</div> 
            Paul, I cut the following in response to your comment: The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pick-random--10-to-20.png" alt="pick random (-10) to (20)" title="pick random (-10) to (20)" /> block generates a random number ranging from -10 through 20.

				<li>
                	Add a line of code so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he not only turns, but also moves to a random position. 
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Use two <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-args.png" alt="pick random () to ()" title="pick random () to ()" /> blocks and one <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-0-0.png" alt="go to x=0 y=0" title="go to x=0 y=0"/> block together at the end of your script. The animation below shows how to snap these together, but you will need to do more than it shows.</li>
                        <li>Make Alonzo move to a random position between -190 and 190 in the <em>x</em> direction and between -130 and 130 in the <em>y</em> direction.</li>
                    </ul><br />

                    <div class="endnote">
                        <p><em>Yellow boxes (like this) contain additional information that you may find useful.</em></p>

                        	The Snap<em>!</em> stage (the white rectangle where sprites act out their scripts) has coordinates. The <em>x</em> axis shows from -240 to 240, and the <em>y</em> axis shows from -180 to 180.<br />

                        </p>
	                    <p>Let Alonzo move only between -190 and 190 in the <em>x</em> direction and between -130 and 130 in the <em>y</em> direction so he doesn't go off the edges of the stage.</p>
                    </div>
				</li>	   
                <li>
                	Click on Alonzo. If your script works, Alonzo should face the other way <em>and</em> move to a random spot on the stage.	</li>
