        <h2>Getting Started with Snap<em>!</em></h2>
        <div class="learn">
    		<p><strong>In this <em>lab</em>,</strong> you'll program an app that you can share with others and play on your phone.</p>
    		<p><strong>On this <em>page</em>,</strong> you'll learn how to create your own account to store your code, how to log in and out, and how to change your account password.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>If you haven't already opened <span class="snap">snap</span>, open it now: <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/run" target="_blank"><strong>http://snap.berkeley.edu/run</strong></a></li>
				<li>
                	In the Snap<em>!</em> window, click the Cloud menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="Cloud button"/>), select "Signup...", and follow the instructions.<br />

              </li>
				<li>Then, check your email to get your initial password, and log in.</li>
				<li>Now, select "Change Password..." from the Cloud menu, and change your password to something easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess.</li>				
				<div class="endnote">You may change your password at any time using the cloud menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="Cloud button"/>).</div>

		<div class="takeNote">If you're doing this in class, you should be working with a partner.  If each of you is in front of a computer, one of you should keep Snap<i>!</i> open, and the other should keep this lab page open.  If you are sharing a computer, use two browser tabs.</div>			  
		
        
        <h3>Logging In to and Out of Your Snap<em>!</em><a name="login" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>Account</h3>

			<p>You should be logged in whenever you are coding. Here's how to check if you are logged in:</p>
            <ol start="5">
				<li>
					Click the Cloud menu in the tool-bar.
                    <ul> 
						<li><strong>If</strong> it says "Logout" and your user name, then you are already logged in.</li>
						<li><strong>If</strong> it says someone else's user name, then log them out and log in with your own user name.</li>
						<li><strong>Otherwise</strong>, choose "Login..." and enter your user name and password.</li>
                    </ul>
				</li>

					Do you have time to continue programming right now?
					<ul> 
						<li><strong>If</strong> you do, then click NEXT (on the top right of this page).</li>
						<li><strong>Otherwise</strong>, log out (using the Cloud menu).</li> 
					</ul>
                    <div class="endnote">Remember to log out every time you are done programming.</div>
