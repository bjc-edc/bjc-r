        <h2>Getting Started with Snap<em>!</em></h2>
        <div class="learn">
    		<p><strong>In this <em>lab</em>,</strong> you'll program an app that you can share with others and play on your phone.</p>
    		<p><strong>On this <em>page</em>,</strong> you'll learn how to create your own account to store your code, how to log in and out, and how to change your account password.</p> 
        </div>
        
		<h3>Creating an Account</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first"> 
			<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/dialog-cloud-signup.png" alt="signing up for the cloud"/> 
			<ol>
				<li>If you haven't already opened <span class="snap">snap</span>, open it now: <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/run" target="_blank"><strong>http://snap.berkeley.edu/run</strong></a></li>
				<li>
                	In the Snap<em>!</em> window that opens, click the Cloud menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="Cloud button"/>), select "Signup...", and follow the instructions.<br />
				  <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-cloud-with-context.png" alt="cloud icon" title="cloud icon"/>
              </li>
				<li>Then, check your email to get your initial password, and log in.</li>
				<div class="endnote">You may change your password at any time using the cloud menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="Cloud button"/>).</div>
				<li>Now, select "Change Password..." from the Cloud menu, and change your password to something easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess.</li>				
			</ol>
		</div>
			  
		<h3>Logging in to and out of Your Snap<em>!</em><a name="login" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>Account</h3>
        
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<p>You should be logged in whenever you are coding. Here's how to check if you are logged in:</p>
            <ol start="5">
				<li>
					Click the Cloud menu in the tool-bar.
               		<div class="commentBig">I think the bold <strong>IF/ELSE</strong> text is a nice idea for pseudocode or design specifications, but here, it didn't feel right to me. It was unclear why that text was bold, and it seems strange to use code mixed in as though it is English. We avoid mixing math in with text as though it were English (e.g. using = for "is" or + for "and") too. --MF 2/13/17</div>
                    <ul> 
						<li>If it says "Logout" and then your user name, then you are already logged in.</li>
						<li>If it says someone else's user name, log them out and then log in with your own user name.</li>
						<li>Otherwise, choose "Login..." and enter your user name and password.</li>
                    </ul>
				</li>
                <li>
					Do you have time to continue programming right now?
					<ul> 
						<li>If you do, click NEXT (on the top right of this page).</li>
						<li>If you are done for now, log out (using the Cloud menu).</li> 
					</ul>
                    <div class="endnote">Remember to log out every time you are done programming.</div>
				</li>
