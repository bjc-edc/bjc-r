        <h2>Getting Started with Snap<em>!</em></h2>
        <div class="todo">
            Developer Remarks (please delete each remark once resolved):
            <ul>
                <li>MF: This is the most highly-rated lab in our course, they have to do this at some point if they want to save their work (until they have an account and know how to save, they may lose everything they make), it doesn't take that much time, and we have limited time to change things. I'm inclined to keep this "management stuff" here where it is.</li>
                <li>BH: Maybe make account later?</li>
                <li>PG: Would like this entire experience to be the HoC "wow" -- right away, a feeling of having built something. Right now, it's reading and management, not accomplishment.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="learn">
    		<p><strong>In this <em>lab</em>,</strong> you'll program an app that you can share with others and play on your phone.</p>
    		<p><strong>On this <em>page</em>,</strong> you'll learn how to create your own account and how to log in and out.</p>

				<li>If you haven't already opened <span class="snap">snap</span>, open it now: <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/run" title="Snap! Build Your Own Blocks" target="_blank"><strong>http://snap.berkeley.edu/run</strong></a></li>
				<li>
                	In the Snap<em>!</em> window, click the Cloud menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="Cloud button"/>), select "Signup...", and follow the instructions. Use your personal email, not your school account, because some schools block external emails.<br />

                    <p>You'll be asked to click a link in your email to verify your account, but you don't have to do that right now.</p>
                    <p>You may change your password at any time using the cloud menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="Cloud button" title="Cloud button"/>).</p>

If each of you is in front of a computer, one of you should keep Snap<i>!</i> open, and the other should keep this lab page open.
