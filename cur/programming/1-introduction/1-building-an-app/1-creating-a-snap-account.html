                <li>PG General comment: Throughout, I'd like at least /us/ to know what kids are intended to /learn/—what is /new/—in each lesson, and I'd like us to consider whether and why that is important. I'd like each new lesson here, as in our mathematics curricula, to (1) /use/ what they have already learned, (2) /teach/ something new (need not be a new block or social fact but does need to be new, like a new context or use), and (3) build toward or foreshadow something future.  I'd like our pink boxes to focus on ideas, not products, and on what is /new/.</li>

				<li>
                	In the Snap<em>!</em> window, click the Cloud menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="Cloud button"/>), select "Signup...", and follow the instructions. Use your personal email, not your school account, because some schools block external emails.<br />

            If you're doing this in class, you should be working with a partner.  If each of you is in front of a computer, one of you should keep Snap<em>!</em> open, and the other should keep this lab page open.  If you are sharing a computer, use two browser tabs.
