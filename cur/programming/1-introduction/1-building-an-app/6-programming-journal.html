		<h2>Keeping a Programming Journal</h2>        
		
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn how a programming journal can help your programming.</p>
        </div>

		<p>Your teacher will either provide or ask you to provide a notebook
		for this class, however your school does that.</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
		In the journal you will keep the following notes every class day:

		<ul>
			<li>
				Any idea about programming that you had trouble understanding
				at first, but did understand by the end of class.
			</li>
			<li>
				Questions you still have, that you want to remember to ask
				at the next class meeting.
			</li>
			<li>
				Ideas you have for projects you want to work on, or ways to
				improve an existing project.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bugs you encountered:
				<ul>
					<li>What was the symptom?</li>
					<li>What did the reason turn out to be?</li>
					<li>What change did you make in the code to fix it?</li>
					<li>What techniques did you use to investigate the bug?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				How did you organize your code?  Did you define new procedures?
				Do they take inputs? What is their <em>domain</em> (what type of
				inputs do they require) and <em>range</em> (what type of value,
				if any, do they report)?  Did you end up copying and pasting
				code where you could have defined a procedure instead?
			</li>
			<li>
				When appropriate, you might want to print pictures of the
				stage, or of important scripts in your code, and tape them
				into the journal.
			</li>
			<li>
				Occasionally your teacher may hand out copies of an
				exercise from the curriculum for you to fill out and
				tape into your journal.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<p><strong>The journal is for you, not for your teacher.</strong>
	You won't be graded on what you do or don't put in it.  (Some
	students have learned in school to think that if something isn't
	graded, the teacher doesn't really think it's important.  But
	in this case, the journal isn't graded because it's a record of
	the things only you experience in the class, not a record of
	the ideas in the curriculum.  Everyone's journal will be different.)</p>

	<p><em>Don't</em> bother journaling things you copy out of the
	curriculum itself, such as vocabulary definitions.  You can always
	look those up in the online curriculum and its index.</p>
