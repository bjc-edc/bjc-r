Clearly, neither of us has tried to do it until now. :/ It's entirely unclear why we are using <code>next costume</code> here other than because we were told too. I didn't even think about <em>why</em> until 1.1.5#4 until I read "and face the other way" and thought, "we must have cut that because I didn't do that," but then I checked the project I was building and Alonzo does flip, so I had to go back to figure out where I'd made him do that. --MF, 8/12/19 <p>I had forgotten about this comment and assigned this page to teachers, I came back specifically to do something about <code>next costume</code> because when they gave their costume, they were clearly confused about what it does. They told the group that it had something to do with how the ghost effect worked. --MF, 10/26/19</p></div>

                            The project you loaded has two sprite costumes&mdash;one facing right and the other facing left&mdash;so you can use the <code>next costume</code> block to make the sprite face the other way. Drag blocks into the center Scripts area to build the script shown here. (For more support, read the yellow box below.) <br />

                        <p>The graphic on the right is misleading because we hand-held them through step 3 above, and now we are showing this unattached. I'd expect many students to leave it unattached (per this image) and be confused as to why it isn't working. Not sure what to do. Maybe add some additional text to the problem statement in 5? --MF, 8/12/19</p>
                        <p>Also, this animation looks a lot like Alonzo is moving around randomly on his own. I think we need an animation with the mouse showing for this one. --MF, 8/12/19</p>
                        <p>Also also, we need to make sure we are teaching the stage coordinates somewhere, don't we? Isn't that important? (Why?) I don't think we are teaching that currently. --MF, 8/12/19</p>
