        <h2>Starting Your First Snap<em>!</em> App</h2>

You'll swap jobs frequently, so it doesn't matter who navigates first. --></p>

        <p>First, you'll change the arrow-head sprite, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/sprite.png" alt="arrow-head sprite" title="arrow-head sprite" />, to look like the Alonzo character (wiggling here), and then you'll program him to turn when he is clicked. </p>

                    Create two costumes for the sprite. You can follow these instructions or watch the animation below.

                        <li>Go to the File menu, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button"/> and select "Costumes...". Choose "alonzo.gif".</li>
                   		<li>Right-click (or, on a Mac, control-click) the Alonzo costume <em>in the gray costume area</em> (not on the white stage) and select "duplicate." </li>
                        <li>
                            Then, right-click (control-click) the new costume, select "edit,"  and click the "flip &xharr;" button. <br />
                            Then, click "OK."

                            The blocks' colors match their palettes: purple for Looks, yellow for Control, etc.

                    	Now, program the sprite to change costumes when Alonzo is clicked.<br />
                        Click the "Scripts" tab above the staging area, and drag blocks into it to build this script: <br />

                    <p>
                    	This animation shows where to find the blocks and how to snap them together: <br />

                <li>Click <em>on Alonzo</em>. If your script works, Alonzo should face the other way.</li>
