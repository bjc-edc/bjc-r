        <p>You and a partner will work together on one computer to program a game you can run on your phones. The point of the game is for you to click on Alonzo as much as you can. Alonzo makes it harder by moving randomly around the screen.</p>
		  <!-- You will take turns being  the <em>driver, </em>the one with hands on the mouse and keyboard, being the <em>navigator, </em>reading the lab instructions, watching your partner drive, and making suggestions about the next step. You'll swap jobs frequently, so it doesn't matter who navigates first. --> 
		<p>It doesn't matter which of you is logged in. You'll learn how to share the project with the other partner in a few pages.</p>

                   		<li>Right-click (on a Mac, control-click) the Alonzo costume <em>in the gray costume area</em> (not on the white stage) and select "duplicate." </li>

                            Then, right-click (control-click) the new costume, select "edit,"  and click the "flip &xharr;" button. <br />
                            Then, click "OK."

					<div class="endnote">Drag one block underneath another to snap them together. The white bar shows where the blocks will snap together if you unclick the mouse.</div>
