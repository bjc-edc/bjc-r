    		<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you'll build a simple game where the player tries to click a character that's moving around.</p>

            <p>We've removed the "uncheck the draggable box" instruction completely and moved it to the starter project. That's fine, but it should be explained in the TG (and maybe a yellow sidebox) so that students who try to build their own version of the project don't get tripped up by that. What do you think about a sidebox? --MF, 11/11/19</p>
            <p>Also, we should be sure that we teach about adding (and perhaps editing, though I'm less attached to that) costumes somewhere because personalizing is a big part of beauty and joy for many students. --MF, 11/11/19</p>
            <p>BTW, I'm experimenting with slightly smaller font for the yellowboxes. Thoughts? (I imagine you, Brian, saying something about how we didn't like the H4 but now I'm trying this. It's a totally different thing to whisper a hint to a student than to yell at them to listen. ;) I'm still wanting to get to an <em>intuitive</em> CSS where students don't have to memorize a bunch of colors. (You'll recall that we aren't going to upload the CSS this week; we'll do it once we are all happy with everything.) --MF, 11/11/19</p>
            <p><strong>That's fine, but you made it smaller (.9) and then smaller again (.85). That's <em>too</em> small. I made it .92; can you live with that?  What's not fine is that some time ago, you (or someone) made h4 <em>smaller </em>than the regular body font!  Headings  aren't supposed to be smaller than the text.  :-(</strong> -bh</p>

                <li>Test your program. Click on the Alonzo sprite on the stage several times. If your program works, Alonzo should move to a random position on the stage each time you click him.</li>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <p>
                The game isn't much fun if Alonzo just sits there waiting to be clicked.  Once you've clicked him, he should keep jumping around on his own. To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says "do this <code>forever</code>."<br />
          </p>        
            <ol start="6">
                <li>
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">A bunch of blocks clicked together is called a <em>script</em>.</div>
                	Add this to your Alonzo script:<br /> 
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever-jump.png" alt="forever {
    go to (random position)
}" title="forever {
    go to (random position)
}" />
                    <div class="narrower">The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you <strong>click the red stop sign</strong>, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="red stop button" title="red stop button"/>, or stop the script in some other way.</div>
                </li>
                <li>Alonzo moves too fast. Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs" /> block to slow him down. Try your program, and increase or reduce the wait time if you like.</li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" /></li>
                <div class="todo"><p>I've always been mixed about whether to put these in an LI or not, and I think we've been inconsistent. Here, I think it's nice to put it in an LI. As a general rule, I could see myself being content with, "it goes in an LI if it's a left-aligned, icon with the text, and it doesn't if it's right-aligned as a mini-icon." Thoughts, Brian? --MF, 11/11/19</p>
                <p><strong>I think in 1.1 we make  it a LI but after that we use the small icon, introducing it explicitly the  first time.  But (a longer discussion) I think all the small icons should  go on the left, not the right.</strong> -bh </p>
