   	        <ol start="3">
                <li>
                    You're going to write a game program in which the object of the game is to click on Alonzo as he's moving around.  As a first step, make Alonzo jump someplace else on the stage when he's clicked. Drag these two blocks into the center area of the window:<br />
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">
                        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/motion-palette-categories.jpg" alt="Palette categories: Motion, Looks, Sound, Pen, Control, Sensing, Operators, and Variables" title="Palette categories: Motion, Looks, Sound, Pen, Control, Sensing, Operators, and Variables" /> 
                        <p>You can find blocks in <em><strong>palettes</strong></em> with their matching color: gold for Control, blue for Motion, etc. <strong>Drag one block underneath another</strong> to snap them together. A bunch of blocks clicked together are called a <em><strong>script</strong></em>.</p>

                    </div>
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/when-clicked-jump.png" width="199" height="87" alt="when I am clicked, go to [random position]">

                    <p>This is a computer program.  It's a very short one, but it'll get more interesting soon.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Check your program: Click on the Alonzo sprite on the white stage in the upper right area of the window. If your script works, Alonzo should move to a random position on the stage each time you click him.</li>

            <!--<h4><strong>Making the Game More Fun</strong></h4>  -->
            <p>The game not much fun if Alonzo just sits there waiting to be clicked.  Once you've clicked him, he should keep jumping around on his own.</p>
            <ol start="6">
                <li>
                	To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says "do this forever."  And there is a block that does that:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever.png" alt="forever" title="forever" /><br />
                    Add this to your Alonzo script:<br /> 
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever-jump.png" alt="forever {
    go to (random position)
}" title="forever {
    go to (random position)
}" />
                    <div class="narrower">The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you <strong>click the red stop sign</strong> (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="red stop button" title="red stop button"/>) or stop that script in some other way.</div>
                </li>
                <li>Alonzo moves too fast. Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs" /> block to slow him down. Try your program and increase or reduce the wait time if you like.</li>
                <div class="endnote">
                    <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/nested-forevers.png" alt="nested forever blocks, alternating dark and light">
                    Don't worry if the block changes color from <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs" /> to <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pale-wait.png" alt="pale-colored wait 1 secs" title="pale-colored wait 1 secs" />
                    when you insert it in your script. Snap<em>!</em> alternates dark and light colors when you nest same-category blocks inside each other.
