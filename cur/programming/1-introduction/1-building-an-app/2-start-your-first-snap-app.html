                <li>Make sure either you or your partner is logged in to Snap<em>!</em> so you can save your work.</li>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/U1L1-ClickAlonzo.xml" class="run"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/load-save.png" alt="Click here to load this file.

                      <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alonzo.png" alt="Alonzo icon" height="60">This is <strong>Alonzo</strong>, the mascot of our programming language, <strong>Snap<em>!</em></strong>. You should be seeing him on the <em><strong>stage</strong>,</em> the white area in the top right corner of the Snap<em>!</em> window.
   	<ol start="3">
        <li>You're going to write a game program in which the object of the game is to click on Alonzo as he's moving around.  As a first step, make Alonzo jump someplace else on the stage when he's clicked. Drag these two blocks into the center area of the window:<br />
                            <div class="sidenoteBig">
                                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/motion-palette-categories.jpg" alt="Palette categories: Motion, Looks, Sound, Pen, Control, Sensing, Operators, and Variables" title="Palette categories: Motion, Looks, Sound, Pen, Control, Sensing, Operators, and Variables" /> 
                                <p>You can find blocks in <em><strong>palettes</strong></em> with their matching color: gold for Control, blue for Motion, etc. <strong>Drag one block underneath another</strong> to snap them together.</p>

                            </div>
          <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/when-clicked-jump.png" width="199" height="87" alt="when I am clicked, go to [random position]">
          <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/go-to-menu-open.png" alt="go to () block with menu open showing 'random position', 'mouse pointer', and 'center'. The mouse pointer is hovering over 'random position'." title="go to () block with menu open showing 'random position', 'mouse pointer', and 'center'. The mouse pointer is hovering over 'random position'." />

<p>This is a computer program.  It's a very short one, but it'll get more interesting soon.</p>

      </li>
               <li>Check your program: Click on the Alonzo sprite on the white stage in the upper right area of the window. If your script works, Alonzo should move to a random position on the stage each time you click him.</li>
  </ol>
    </div>
                        
        <div class="takeNote">
            <div class="comment">CRD-2.C.2, CRD-2.C.3, CRD-2.C.5</div>
            <img class="imageLeft" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/hat-block.png" alt="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When" title="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When"/>
            <p>Blocks that look like this can be used to detect an <strong>event</strong> such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>). They tell the script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap<em>!</em> programmers call them "hat blocks."  Using events to control a program is called <em><strong>event-driven programming</strong></em>.</p>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-i-am-clicked.png" alt="when i am (clicked)" title="when i am (clicked)" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-green-flag-clicked-full-size.png" alt="when 'green flag' clicked" title="when 'green flag' clicked" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-space-key-pressed.png" alt="when (space) key pressed" title="when (space) key pressed" />
            <p>Find these blocks in the yellow Control palette, and see what other choices are in their drop-down menus.</p>
	    <p>Don't think that <em>every</em> script needs a hat block.  You can also run a script by clicking on it.</p>
        </div>
    <p>It's a good idea to 
        <em><strong>save</strong></em> your project every so often:
<div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="5">
                <li>
                    Choose "Save" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button" title="File button"/>).
                </li>	
            </ol>
        </div>

   <h4>Make the game challenging</h4>  
   <p>It's not much fun if Alonzo just sits there waiting to be clicked.  Once you've clicked him, he should keep jumping around on his own.<div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="6">
                <li>
                	To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says "do this forever."  And there is a block that does that:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever.png" alt="forever" title="forever" /><br />
                    Add this to your Alonzo script:<br /> 
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever-jump.png" alt="forever {
    go to (random position)
}" title="forever {
    go to (random position)
}" />
                    <div class="narrower">The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you <strong>click the red stop sign</strong> (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="red stop button" title="red stop button"/>) or stop that script in some other way.</div>
                </li>
                <li>Alonzo moves too fast. Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs" /> block to slow him down. Try your program and increase or reduce the wait time if you like.</li>
            <div class="endnote"><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/nested-forevers.png" alt="nested forever blocks, alternating dark and light">Don't worry if the block changes color from <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs" /> to <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pale-wait.png" alt="pale-colored wait 1 secs" title="pale-colored wait 1 secs" />
when you insert it in your script. Snap<em>!</em> alternates dark and light colors when you nest same-category blocks inside each other.</div>
<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />
            </ol>
