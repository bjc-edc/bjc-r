    	<p>You are going to code an interactive game for a mobile device. The point of the game is for you to click on Alonzo as much as you can. Alonzo makes it harder by moving randomly around the screen.</p>
		<p><img class="imageLeft" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/work-with-a-partner.png" alt="Work with a Partner" title="Work with a Partner" /> You and a partner will work together on one computer. <!-- You will take turns being  the <em>driver, </em>the one with hands on the mouse and keyboard, being the <em>navigator, </em>reading the lab instructions, watching your partner drive, and making suggestions about the next step. You'll swap jobs frequently, so it doesn't matter who navigates first. --> It doesn't matter which of you is logged in; later in the activity you'll learn how to share the project with the other partner.</p>

        <p>First, you'll change the arrow-head sprite, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/sprite.png" alt="arrow-head sprite" title="arrow-head sprite" />, to look like the Alonzo character (wiggling here), and then you'll program him to turn when he is clicked. </p>

                    Create two costumes for the sprite. You can follow these instructions or watch the animation below.
                      <ol>
                        <li>Go to the File menu, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button"/> and select "Costumes...". Choose "Alonzo".</li>
                   		<li>Right-click (or, on a Mac, control-click) the Alonzo costume <em>in the gray costume area</em> (not on the white stage) and select "duplicate." </li>
                        <li>
                            Then, right-click (control-click) the new costume, select "edit,"  and click the "flip &xharr;" button. <br />
                            Then, click "OK."
                        </li>

                            The blocks' colors match their palettes: purple for Looks, yellow for Control, etc.
                        </div>
                    	Now, program the sprite to change costumes when Alonzo is clicked.<br />
                        Click the "Scripts" tab above the gray costume area, and drag blocks into it to build this script: <br />

					<div class="endnote">Drag one block underneath another to snap them together. The white bar shows where the blocks will snap together if you unclick the mouse.</div>
                    <p>
                    	This animation shows where to find the blocks and how to snap them together: <br />

                </li>
                <li>Click <em>on Alonzo</em> on the white stage. If your script works, Alonzo should face the other way.</li>
