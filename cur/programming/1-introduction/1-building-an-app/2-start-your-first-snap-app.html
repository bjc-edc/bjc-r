                    <div class="todo">We've cut so much of this project that it needs some work to re-cohere. Clearly, neither of us has tried to do it until now. :/ It's entirely unclear why we are using <code>next costume</code> here other than because we were told too. I didn't even think about <em>why</em> until 1.1.5#4 until I read "and face the other way" and thought, "we must have cut that because I didn't do that," but then I checked the project I was building and Alonzo does flip, so I had to go back to figure out where I'd made him do that. --MF, 8/12/19 </div>
                    Program the sprite to change costumes when it is clicked. Drag blocks into the center Scripts area to build the script shown here. (For more support, read the yellow box below.) <br />

                        <p>You can find blocks in palettes with their matching color: purple for Looks, yellow for Control, blue for Motion, etc.</p>
                        <p>Drag one block underneath another to snap them together. The thin white bar shows where the blocks will snap together if you release the mouse button.</p>

                        <p>The graphic on the right is misleading because we hand-held them through step 3 above, and now we are showing this unattached. I'd expect many students to leave it unattached (per this image) and be confused as to why it isn't working. Not sure what to do. Maybe add some additional text to the problem statement in 5? --MF, 8/12/19</p>
                        <p>Also, this animation looks a lot like Alonzo is moving around randomly on his own. I think we need an animation with the mouse showing for this one. --MF, 8/12/19</p>
                        <p>Also also, we need to make sure we are teaching the stage coordinates somewhere, don't we? Isn't that important? (Why?) I don't think we are teaching that currently. --MF, 8/12/19</p>
