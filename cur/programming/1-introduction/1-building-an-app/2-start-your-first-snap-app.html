            <p>Blocks that look like this can be used to detect an <strong>event</strong> such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>). They tell the script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap<em>!</em> programmers call them "hat blocks."  Using events to control a program is called <em><strong>event-driven programming</strong></em>.</p>
	        <p>Not every script needs a hat block; you can also run a script by clicking on it.</p>

        <h3>Making the Game Challenging</h3>  
        <p>
            The game isn't much fun if Alonzo just sits there waiting to be clicked.  Once you've clicked him, he should keep jumping around on his own. To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says "do this <code>forever</code>." And there is a block that does it:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever.png" alt="forever" title="forever" />
        </p>        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="6">
                <li>
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">A bunch of blocks clicked together is called a <em>script</em>.</div>
                	Attach this to the bottom of your Alonzo script:<br /> 
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever-jump.png" alt="forever {
    go to (random position)
}" title="forever {
    go to (random position)
}" />
                    <div class="narrower">The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you <strong>click the red stop sign</strong>, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="red stop button" title="red stop button"/>, or stop the script in some other way.</div>
                    <div class="todo">Brian, we agreed that this instruction deserves an animated GIF of snapping things together---a hinted video in an endnote. --MF, 1/21/20</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alonzo moves too fast. Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs" /> block to slow him down. Try your program, and increase or reduce the wait time if you like.
                    <div class="endnote">
                        Where the <code>wait</code> block goes in your script matters. Do you want the script to wait one time or each time Alonzo moves?                        
                    </div>
                </li>

                <div class="todo"><p>I've always been mixed about whether to put these in an LI or not, and I think we've been inconsistent. Here, I think it's nice to put it in an LI. As a general rule, I could see myself being content with, "it goes in an LI if it's a left-aligned, icon with the text, and it doesn't if it's right-aligned as a mini-icon." Thoughts, Brian? --MF, 11/11/19</p>
                <p><strong>I think in 1.1 we make  it a LI but after that we use the small icon, introducing it explicitly the  first time.  But (a longer discussion) I think all the small icons should  go on the left, not the right.</strong> -bh </p>
