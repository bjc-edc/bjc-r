        <h2>Giving the Player Feedback</h2>
        <div class="todo">I renamed this page because this page is about two things, and "keeping score" is only one of them. --MF, 11/11/19<p>Also, I split this page up into a lot of pieces. See what you think. --MF, 11/11/19</p></div>
        <div class="todo">I know we might not keep these, but I wrote one just in case. --MF, 11/11/19<div class="learn">On this page, you will create a way for the player of your game to know how well they are doing.</div></div>

<p>Now the game is challenging, but you can't tell how well you're doing, since Alonzo jumps around whether you click him or not. You're going to fix that.</p>        
        <h3>Confirming Whether Alonzo Was Clicked</h3>
   <!--     <div class="forYouToDo">
         <p>First, the person playing your game wants to know right away whether they succeeded at clicking Alonzo before he moved out of the way.</p>

                <p>Sprites can wear costumes just like actors in a play. Your sprite named "Alonzo" has two costumes of the Alonzo mascot. But in future projects, you can have sprites with other names and that wear other costumes.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Alonzo jumps around whether the player clicks him or not, but the player will want to know whether they clicked Alonzo before he moved again. The project you loaded has two sprite <em>costumes</em>&mdash;one facing right and the other facing left&mdash;so you can use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/next-costume.png" alt="next costume"> block to make the sprite face the other way each time he is clicked.  <br />

	<div class="todo">Sprites and costumes:  I stand by the original wording and layout, which give the student just enough information without being intimidating, which I think your version is.  Also, your version has too much intro text in the green stripe box.  If I can't talk you out of it, it has to be non-green, before the box.  I've tried to deal with your objection about two different things named Alonzo by removing all references to names from the green box.  And I think seeing the two costumes next to each other is way better than watching them blink, which drives me crazy, and doesn't really give the student a chance to see how they're related. -bh</div>

There are actually three objects  in this project related to Alonzo. One is a <em><strong>sprite</strong></em>,  which is like an actor on the stage who knows how to do many different things, such as walk around the stage and speak the lines of the play.  The other two are <em><strong>costumes</strong></em>,  picture that can be &quot;worn&quot; by a sprite.</p>

                    <p><strong>I swapped what's inside and outside the todo. This is <em>way</em> too much.  It looks like half an hour's work, instead of five  minutes' work.  Especially the part that's just them fooling around with  transparency values.  (I point out that <em>this is why I made that picture! </em>It tells them everything they need to know at a glance.
                    I have tried to deal with your issues with it by hinting it and adding a <em>short</em> explanation.) <br>
