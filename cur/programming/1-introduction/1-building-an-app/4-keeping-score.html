        <h2>Giving the Player Feedback</h2>
        <div class="todo">I renamed this page because this page is about two things, and "keeping score" is only one of them. --MF, 11/11/19<p>Also, I split this page up into a lot of pieces. See what you think. --MF, 11/11/19</p></div>
        <div class="learn"><div class="todo">I know we might not keep these, but I wrote one just in case. --MF, 11/11/19</div>On this page, you will create a way for the player of your game to know how well they are doing.</div>
        
        <h3>Confirming Whether Alonzo Was Clicked</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <div class="sidenote">
                <p>Sprites can wear costumes just like actors in a play. Your sprite named "Alonzo" has two costumes of the Alonzo mascot. But in future projects, you can have sprites with other names and that wear other costumes.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Alonzo jumps around whether the player clicks him or not, but the player will want to know whether they clicked Alonzo before he moved again. The project you loaded has two sprite <em>costumes</em>&mdash;one facing right and the other facing left&mdash;so you can use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/next-costume.png" alt="next costume"> block to make the sprite face the other way each time he is clicked.  <br />
                <!--<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alonzo.png" alt="Alonzo character" title="Alonzo character" height="60">

                <div class="endnote">You can start and stop the animation above by clicking it.</div>
            </p>
            <div class="todo">The green box about sprites and costumes that was here didn't work. It's confusing to introduce two things that have the same name ("Alonzo") at the same time. See my yellow sidenote above. How does that work for you? --MF, 11/11/19
            <div class="narrower">
                <p><strong>Sprites and Costumes.</strong> There are actually two things named "Alonzo" in this project. One is a <em><strong>sprite</strong></em>, which is like an actor on the stage who knows how to do many different things, such as walk around the stage and speak the lines of the play.  The other is a <em><strong>costume</strong></em>, which is a picture that's &quot;worn&quot; by the sprite.</p>
            </div></div>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Program Alonzo to face the other way when clicked. Add the <code>next costume</code> block to the place in your script where the user has just clicked on Alonzo.</li>
                <li>Test your program. Make sure Alonzo faces the other way when he is clicked but not when he isn't clicked.</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Keeping Score</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <p>The player will also want to know how much progress they have made in the game. </p>
            <ol start="3">

                    <p>I like the conciseness of what had been here (below in this red box), but I also like it unpacked and clarified a bit as I have done below the red box. Thoughts? Can we trim it down without loosing the first-day support that we have now? --MF, 11/11/19</p>
                    <li>The command <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghosteffect.png" alt="ghost effect" title="ghost effect" /> can control Alonzo's <em>transparency</em> (how much you can see what's behind it on the stage). Drag the block into the center scripting area, and experiment with different input numbers (clicking it repeatedly after each change) to see exactly what it does.  At what ghost effect value does Alonzo become completely invisible?  (That's when you win the game.) You can use the command <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/clear-graphic-effects.png" alt="clear graphic effects"> to make Alonzo fully opaque again.</li>    
                    <li>Then, modify your script so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little more ghostly.  Think about how the input you use affects the length of the game play. &quot;Playtest&quot; your game.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Drag the <code>change (ghost) effect</code> block into the scripting area, but don't attach it to any other code yet.</li>

                                    <li>Change the input number. (Try a whole number from 0 to 100.) Then click the modified block (the <code>change (ghost) effect</code> with your input number) in the scripting area repeatedly.</li>

                                        Reset your project. (Since you are experimenting with a graphics change, you can click the command <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/clear-graphic-effects.png" alt="clear graphic effects"> to make Alonzo fully opaque again, that is, not-see-through.)

        <h3>Making the Game More Challenging</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<p>At this point, the game doesn't encourage the player to play quickly. But if the goal is to make Alonzo disappear by clicking him and you make him reappear whenever he moves on his own, you can make your game more challenging to play.</p>
            <ol start="4">
                <li>
                    Figure out where to add a <code>change (ghost) effect by (-5)</code> block to your script to make Alonzo get more opaque (less see-through) any time he moves <em>without</em> being clicked. 
                </li>
                <li>Play your game a few times, and adjust your code to get a level of difficulty that you like.</li>
                <div class="endnote">You can change the <code>ghost effect</code> input number and the <code>wait</code> time to make the game easier or harder.</div>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <p>So far, Alonzo keeps jumping around and getting more visible even after the player makes him totally invisible. But when Alonzo is completely transparent, the game should <em>stop.</em></p>

    			<li>
                    Add this code to the right place in your script to end the game.<br />
