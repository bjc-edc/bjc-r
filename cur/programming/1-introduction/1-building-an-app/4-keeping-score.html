        <h2>Keeping Score</h2>
        <h4>Now the game is challenging, but you can't tell how well you're doing, sinceAlonzo jumps around whether you click him or not. You're going to fix that.</h4>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
   	<p>First, the person playing your game wants to know right away whether they succeeded at clicking Alonzo before he moved out of the way.</p>
            <div class="narrower">
            <p><strong>Sprites and Costumes.</strong>There are actually two things named "Alonzo" in this project. One is a <em><strong>sprite</strong></em>, which is like an actor on the stage who knows how to do many different things, such as walk around the stage and speak the lines of the play.  The other is a <em><strong>costume</strong></em>, which is a picture that's &quot;worn&quot; by the sprite.</p></div>
                                Program Alonzo to face the other way when clicked.

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The project you loaded has two sprite costumes&mdash;one facing right and the other facing left&mdash;so you can use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/next-costume.png" alt="next costume"> block to make the sprite face the other way.  Add that block to the place in your program where the user has just clicked on Alonzo.  Test the program to make sure you see Alonzo flip around when you click him, but not when you don't click him.
                        </li>
</ol>
<p>Next, the player wants to know how much progress they made toward winning the game.</p>
            <p><img class="imageRight noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghost-effect-alonzo.png" />
            </p>
            <ol start="2">
                <li>The command <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghosteffect.png" alt="ghost effect" title="ghost effect" /> can control Alonzo's <em>transparency</em> (how much you can see what's behind it on the stage). Drag the block into the center scripting area, and experiment with different input numbers (clicking it repeatedly after each change) to see exactly what it does.  At what ghost effect value does Alonzo become completely invisible?  (That's when you win the game.) You can use the command <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/clear-graphic-effects.png" alt="clear graphic effects">
                  to make Alonzo fully opaque again.
              </li>    
                <li>Then, modify your script so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little more ghostly.  Think about how the input you use affects the length of the game play. &quot;Playtest&quot; your game.</li>
                <li>
                    <div class="todo">
                        <p>Have we decided whether this should be <code>change ghost effect by -5</code> <em>or</em> <code>change (</code> <var>ghost</var> <code>) effect by (</code> <var>-5</var> <code>)</code> <em>or</em> <code>change </code> <var>ghost</var> <code> effect by </code> <var>-5</var> <code></code>? We have not been consistent about this throughout the course. Here, I think it would be clearer with either the 2nd or 3rd option so you can see which characters are arguments. --MF, 8/12/19</p>
                        <p><strong>We had decided &lt;var&gt; should be for variables; that's why we colored it orange. We could add another style for constants, but then it turns into the sort of unreadable mess that makes me hate code coloring altogether.  So what I really think is that we should flush &lt;var&gt;, and if the text isn't clear, use a picture.</strong></p>
                    </div>
                Figure out where to put another block in your script to <code>change ghost effect by -5</code> any time Alonzo moves <em>without</em> being clicked. With this change, the player can't wait a long time between clicks; you have to get Alonzo several jumps in a row to win.</li>
                <li>Play your game a few times. Adjust your code to get a level of difficulty that you like.</li>
                <div class="endnote">You can change the ghost effect value and the wait time to make the game easier or harder.</div>
                <li>When Alonzo is completely transparent, you'd like the game to 
            <em>stop.</em>
So far, Alonzo keeps jumping around and getting stronger. Add this code to the right place in your script to fix it.<br />

          <div class="todo">I think you, Brian, want a slightly different message here. What's right? --MF, 8/12/19 <br /><b>"Save your work."  And make a new one "Now would be a good time to save your work."  That one goes mid-page when appropriate. -bh</b></div>
