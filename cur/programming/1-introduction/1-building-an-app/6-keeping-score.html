		<h2>Make It a Game</h2>
        
<p>Now the fun part:  You'll make your app into a real game.  When clicked, Alonzo will keep moving around the stage.  You try to click on Alonzo, and if you succeed, Alonzo turns a little lighter in color and jumps to another spot.  If you miss, Alonzo just jumps and doesn't change color.  The goal of the game is to make Alonzo turn so light that he can't be seen. 
<div class="comment">We could use a video here that shows the game being played.  Use alonzo.xml in the prog>1-introduction folder.  Well, that one has to be stripped of the if-else for right here, but that could be put back and it would make a nice enhancement for the TIF. I'd like to re-learn how to do this.</div>      </p>

            <ol>
                <li>The command <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghosteffect.png" alt="ghost effect" title="ghost effect" /> controls Alonzo's brightness. Experiment with different inputs to see exactly what it does.  
                </li>    
                <li>Modify your script so that when Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little lighter.  Experiment with the open slots in this template. <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alonzodance.png" alt="alonzo dance" title="alonzo dance" />
                <div class="sidenote">You can use the ghost effect and  the wait time and to make the game eaiser or harder. </div> <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />
</li>
                </ol></div>
                
<p>Play your game a few times to get it at the level of difficulty that you want.  If you are happy with it, you can publish it with the instructions on the next page.  But it might be fun to add one more feature:  When Alonzo gets so light that he can barely be seen, make the game stop and have Alonzo say something like, "OK, you win."  Here are some ideas to help with that: </p>
