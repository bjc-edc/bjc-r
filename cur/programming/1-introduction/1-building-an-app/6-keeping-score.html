                <strong>On this page,</strong> you'll make your app more like a game. Each time the player clicks on Alonzo, he will become a little lighter. The goal of the game is to click on Alonzo until he disappears.<br>

                	To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says "do this forever."  And there is a block that does it:<br>

                    Modify your Alonzo script so that it keeps going.<br>

				<li>Alonzo  moves too fast! Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs"> block to slow him down. You can increase or reduce the wait time if you like.</li>
                <li>The command <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghosteffect.png" alt="ghost effect" title="ghost effect"> controls Alonzo's brightness. Experiment with different inputs to see exactly what it does.</li>

                    Then, modify your script so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little lighter.
                </li>
                <li>Play your game a few times.  Adjust your code to get a level of difficulty that you like.</li>
				<div class="endnote">You can use the ghost effect and the wait time and to make the game easier or harder.</div>

                	Put another block in your program to <code>change ghost effect by -5</code> any time Alonzo moves <em>without</em> being clicked.
