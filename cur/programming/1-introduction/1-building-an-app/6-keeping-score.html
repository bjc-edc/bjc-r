		<h2>Make It a Game</h2>
        <div class="learn">
        	<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you'll make your app more like a game. Each time the player clicks on Alonzo, he will become a little lighter. The goal of the game is to click on Alonzo until he disappears.<br />

        <div class="todo">
        ST-Video added Image changed, confirm all OK. <br /><br />
        	We could use a video here that shows the game being played.  Use alonzo.xml in the prog/1-introduction folder.  Well, that one has to be stripped of the if-else for right here, but that could be put back and it would make a nice enhancement for the TIF. I'd like to re-learn how to do this.

                	To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says "do this forever."  And there is a block that does it:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever.png" alt="forever" title="forever" /><br />
                    Modify your Alonzo script so that it keeps going.<br /> <div class="comment">Script pic needs to be changed: input to y must vary only -130 to 130. Current inputs run off the screen. ST-DONE</div>
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/U1ImageVideoAddendum_img/U1L1P6_toofast.png"  height="200" alt=""/>
                    <div class="endnote">The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you click the red stop sign or stop that script in some other way.</div>
                </li>
				<li>Alonzo  moves too fast! Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs" /> block to slow him down. You can increase or reduce the wait time if you like.</li>
                <li>The command <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghosteffect.png" alt="ghost effect" title="ghost effect" /> controls Alonzo's brightness. Experiment with different inputs to see exactly what it does.</li>    
                <li>
                    <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />
                    Then, modify your script so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little lighter.
                </li>
                <li>Play your game a few times.  Adjust your code to get a level of difficulty that you like.</li>
                    <div class="endnote">You can use the ghost effect and the wait time and to make the game easier or harder.</div> 
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ifTime">
            <ol start="6">
                <li>Put another block in your program to <code>change ghost effect by -5</code> any time Alonzo moves <em>without</em> being clicked. </li>
            </ol>
