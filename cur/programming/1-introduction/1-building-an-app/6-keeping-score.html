		<h2>Make It a Game</h2>
        
<p>Now the fun part:  You'll make your app into a real game.  When clicked, Alonzo will keep moving around the stage.  You try to click on Alonzo
<ul>
<li><strong>If</strong>  you succeed, Alonzo turns a little lighter in color and jumps to another spot,</li>
<li><strong>Else</strong> Alonzo just jumps to another spot and doesn't change color</li>
</ul>
The goal of the game is to make Alonzo turn so light that he can't be seen. 
<div class="comment">We could use a video here that shows the game being played.  Use alonzo.xml in the prog>1-introduction folder.  Well, that one has to be stripped of the if-else for right here, but that could be put back and it would make a nice enhancement for the TIF. I'd like to re-learn how to do this.</div>      </p>  

First, to make Alonzo keep moving to a random spot on the stage, you want a block that says "do this <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/nextbone.png" alt="the repeated move" title="the repeated move" />   forever."  And there is a block in the control pallette that does it:   <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever.png" alt="forever" title="forever" />.  Modify your Alonzo script so that it keeps going (until you click the red button).
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/toofast.png" alt="toofast" title="toofast" />.   
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
            <li>  
            
            Alonzo probably moves too fast for the game.  Find a way to slow him down.    
            
              </li>
            
             
            
            
                <li>The command <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghosteffect.png" alt="ghost effect" title="ghost effect" /> controls Alonzo's brightness. Experiment with different inputs to see exactly what it does.  
                </li>    
                <li>Modify your script so that when Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little lighter.  
                <div class="sidenote">You can use the ghost effect and  the wait time and to make the game eaiser or harder.</li>
                 </div> <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />

                </ol></div>
                
<p>Play your game a few times.  Adjust your code to get a level of difficulty that you like.  If you are happy with it, you can publish it with the instructions on the next page.  But it might be fun to add one more feature:  When Alonzo gets so light that he  can barely be seen, make the game stop and have Alonzo say something like, "OK, you win."  Here are some ideas to help with that: </p>  

<div class="takeItFurther">
    <ol type="A">
        <li>If you <a href="/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/effect.xml" class="run">load this file</a>, you'll get a special block that can <em>report</em> the current value of several effects.  Experiment with <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/effect.png" alt="effect" title="effect" />. What range of values does it return?<div class="sidenote"><code>effect</code> can be used with other inputs, too. </div> What value is good enough to make you want to end the game?  </li> s
 
        <li>To make the game stop when Alonzo disappears, introduce a <strong>control</strong>.
        <ul>
<li><strong>If</strong>  If the value of <code>ghost effect</code> is large enough, <code>say</code> "You won",</li>
<li><strong>Else</strong> The game continues.</li>
</ul>
Here's the skeleton of a block that will do this:

<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ifbone.png" alt="if new" title="if new" />
 
 <div class="sidenote">Experiment with the <strong>predicate</strong> <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/greater.png" alt="greater" title="greater" /></div>
 </li> 
    </ol>
 
</div>
