        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure your project is saved.</li>
                <li>Then, choose "Open..." from the File menu, <strong>select the file</strong> from the project list by clicking on its name (in this lab, "U1L1-ClickAlonzo"), and click "Share."</li>
                <li>
                    Then, say "Yes" you want to publish. (You can now cancel or open. It doesn't matter.) </li>
                    <li> Copy the URL (web address) from the top of your browser window. You can <strong>use that link</strong> to share the app.
                    <div class="endnote">You can also make a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/" target="_blank">tinyurl</a> for your game to make typing the URL easier.</div>

                </ol></div>

                <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /> Log out and let your partner log in. Open the link you created with the first partner's account, and save the project in the second partner's account so that you both have a copy. 
                	<div class="endnote">Note: these are copies, not the same file. So, if you change the project in one person's account, it will not change in the other person's account; you will need to share it again.</div>
