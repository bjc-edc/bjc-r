		<h2>Make It a Game</h2>
        
<p>Now the fun part:  You'll make your app into a real game.  When clicked, Alonzo will keep moving around the screen.  You try to click on Alonzo, and if you succeed, Alonzo turns a little lighter in color and jumps to another spot.  If you miss, Alonzo just jumps and doesn't change color.  The goal of the game is to make Alonzo turn so light that it can't be seen. 
<div class="comment">We could use a video here that shows the game being played.  Use alonzo.xml in the prog>1-introduction folder.  I'd like to re-learn how to do this.</div>      </p>

                <li>The command <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghosteffect.png" alt="ghost effect" title="ghost effect" /> controls Alonzo's brightness. Experiment with different inputs to see exactly what it does.

Open the link you created with the first partner's account, and save the project in the second partner's account so that you both have a copy.
