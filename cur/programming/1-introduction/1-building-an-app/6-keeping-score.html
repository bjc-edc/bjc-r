		<h2>Make It a Game</h2>
        <div class="learn">
        	<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you'll make your app more like a game. Each time the player clicks on Alonzo, he will become a little lighter. The goal of the game is to click on Alonzo until he disappears.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="todo">
        	We could use a video here that shows the game being played.  Use alonzo.xml in the prog/1-introduction folder.  Well, that one has to be stripped of the if-else for right here, but that could be put back and it would make a nice enhancement for the TIF. I'd like to re-learn how to do this.

                <li>
                	To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says "do this forever."  And there is a block that does it:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever.png" alt="forever" title="forever" /><br />
                    Modify your Alonzo script so that it keeps going.<br /> <div class="comment">Script pic needs to be changed: input to y must vary only -130 to 130. Current inputs run off the screen.</div>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/toofast.png" alt="toofast" title="toofast" />
                    <div class="endnote">The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you click the red stop sign or stop that script in some other way.</div>
                </li>
				<li>Alonzo  moves too fast! Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs" /> block to slow him down. You can increase or reduce the wait time if you like.</li>
                <li>The command <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghosteffect.png" alt="ghost effect" title="ghost effect" /> controls Alonzo's brightness. Experiment with different inputs to see exactly what it does.</li>    
                <li>
                    <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />
                    Then, modify your script so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little lighter.
                </li>
                <li>Play your game a few times.  Adjust your code to get a level of difficulty that you like.</li>
                    <div class="endnote">You can use the ghost effect and the wait time and to make the game easier or harder.</div> 
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ifTime">
            <ol start="6">
                <li>Put another block in your program to <code>change ghost effect by -5</code> any time Alonzo moves <em>without</em> being clicked. </li>
            </ol>

        <div class="todo">
            There was a TIF here, but there were several problems with it:
            <ul>
                <li>It required exporting a block from the XML project and we offered no instructions for doing this.</li>
                <li>
                	Even if we had provided importing instructions, we didn't discuss how to <em>stop</em> the <code>forever</code> block. <em>Has anyone built this following these instructions?</em> I found them too vague. What goes inside the else? Where does this script go? Inside <code>forever</code>?<br />
					<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ifbone.png" alt="if new" title="if new" />
				</li>
            </ul>
            <p>--MF </p>
            <p>PG: Two things: (1) I think we should attempt to make them less vague, but still in a TiF.  I would use <code>if</code>, not <code>if-else</code> and I'd add it to the algorithm that is repeated forever: <code>if</code> <em>ghost effect</em> <code> > 0, say 'you win', stop all</code>. (2) If we do, we need to change the script to reflect the current ever-changing state of Snap! There is no &quot;ghost effect&quot; block. </p>
        </div>
		<!--<div class="takeItFurther">
        	<p>If you are happy with your game, you can share it with the instructions on the next page, but it might be fun to add one more feature. When Alonzo gets so light that he  can barely be seen, make the game stop and have Alonzo say something like, "You win!" Here are some ideas:</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>If you <a href="/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/effect.xml" class="run">load this file</a>, you'll get a special block that can <em>report</em> the current value of several effects.  Experiment with <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/effect.png" alt="effect" title="effect" />. What range of values does it return?<div class="sidenote"><code>effect</code> can be used with other inputs, too. </div> What value is good enough to make you want to end the game?  </li> 
                <li>
                    To make the game stop when Alonzo disappears, introduce a <strong>control</strong>.
                    <ul>
                        <div class="todo">I've been editing out these bolded if/else lists, but I won't here because I'm commenting the whole TIF out. --MF</div>
                        <li><strong>If</strong> the value of <code>ghost effect</code> is large enough, <code>say</code> "You won",</li>
                        <li><strong>Else</strong> The game continues.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Here's the skeleton of a block that will do this:
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ifbone.png" alt="if new" title="if new" />
                    <div class="sidenote">Experiment with the <strong>predicate</strong> <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/greater.png" alt="greater" title="greater" /></div>
                </li> 
            </ol>
        </div>-->
