								<li>You can send this XML file to others. To open the file, they can go to Snap<em>!</em> and drag in the XML file. They can also go to the File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>) and Open... the file.</li>

If the second partner changes the project, they need to save and share the project (as a file or a link) again with the first partner for the first partner to see the change.
