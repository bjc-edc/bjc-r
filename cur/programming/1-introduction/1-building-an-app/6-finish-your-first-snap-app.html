		<h2>Finishing Your First Snap<em>!</em> App</h2>

		<p>In Snap<em>!</em>, a sprite can have more than one script controlling its behavior. You currently have just one script, which runs <em>when you click</em> on Alonzo. Now you'll make a second script that runs <em>when you click on the green flag</em>. The new script will get Alonzo to welcome the player to your game.</p>
        <div class="takeNote">
        	<p><em>Orange boxes (like this) contain <strong>information</strong> or <strong>ideas</strong> you will want to remember.</em></p>
            <p>Clicking the green flag at the top right, <img class="button" src="/bjc-r-2017-18/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button"/>, is one way to start a Snap<em>!</em> script. You can stop all running scripts by clicking the red stop sign, <img class="button" src="/bjc-r-2017-18/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="stop button"/>.</p>
        </div>

                <li>Create a second script that makes Alonzo move to (190, -130) and <code>say</code> a welcome message whenever the green flag is clicked. (Alonzo might say, "Welcome to 'Click On Alonzo!' Keep clicking me if you can!") . </li>
			    <li>
                	Make that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo.
                	  <div class="endnote">The <img src="/bjc-r-2017-18/img/blocks/say-empty.png" alt="say ()" title="say ()" /> block with an empty input will make the  sprite  say nothing.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                	Check that your app does everything you want:
                	  <ul>
                    	<li>When the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should move to (190, -130) and say its message.</li>
                        <li>When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage and face the other way.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
 			</ol>

                    So far, Alonzo waits in one place to be clicked. Increase the challenge by adding code so that after the first  click and from them on, Alonzo moves to a random position on the stage every two seconds (even if not clicked).

                        <li>Put another block in your program to change the ghost effect by -5 any time Alonzo moves without being clicked. </li>

                                <li>Piazza Feedback 9/15/15: [Take it further B] is problematic.  When a student drops a reset button into the costumes, suddenly the "next costume" code s/he has already programmed will turn Alonzo into a reset button and then later back to left and right Alonzo's again.  The lab is not clear to a novice that the costume belongs to a different/new sprite because creating new sprites has not been covered yet.  We had churned through all this in the old labs and figured out what the students were going to run into.  Now with new labs we have to start all over again and I am hesitant to let them proceed if it means having to devote class time to a few leaders while others are still struggling to get started.</li>
                                <li>GH Feedback 9/1/15: The reset button doesn't seem to work without using broadcast - it seems like the clear graphic effects and set ghost effect blocks are sprite specific. None of my students were able to get a reset block to work.<ul><li>BH: Either we teach them broadcast (or TELL) or we flush the example.</li></ul></li>

                          Add a reset button by <strong>creating a sprite </strong>(see sidenote) with a reset button costume (made in Snap<em>!</em> or using an imported image) that will <code>clear graphic effects</code> or <code>set ghost effect to 0</code> when clicked.</li>  -->
