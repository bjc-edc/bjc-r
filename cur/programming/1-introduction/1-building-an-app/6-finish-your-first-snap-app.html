		<h2>Finish Your First Snap<em>!</em> App</h2>
        
        <p><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /></p>

		<p>In Snap<em>!</em>, a sprite can have more than one script controlling its behavior. You currently have just one script, which runs when you click on Alonzo. Now you'll make a second script that runs when you click on the green flag. The new script will get Alonzo to welcome the player to your game.. </p>
        <div class="endnote">Clicking the green flag at the top right, <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button"/>, is one way to start a Snap! script. You can stop all running scripts by clicking the red stop sign, <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="stop button"/>. </div>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
    		<ol>
			    <div class="sidenote">Hint: You can do this using just 3 blocks!</div>
                <li>Create a second script that makes Alonzo move to (190, -130) and <code>say</code> a welcome message whenever the green flag is clicked. (Alonzo might say, "Welcome to Click On Alonzo! Keep clicking me if you can!") . </li>
			    <li>
                	Make that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo. 
                	<div class="endnote"> You will use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-Hello-World!.png" > block with your message. An empty input will get Alonzo to stop saying whatever he's saying.</div> 
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Where should the <code>Say</code> block go?
                </li>
                <li>
                	Check that your app does everything you intend it to do:
                	<ul>
                    	<li>When the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should move to (190, -130) and say a welcome message.</li>
                        <li>When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage and face the other way.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
 			</ol>
</div>
        
        <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />
        
        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
            <ol type="A">
                <li>If you have extra time, add code so that after the first time Alonzo is clicked, every two seconds he moves to a random position.</li>
                <div class="endnote"><strong>Translating English into code:</strong> "every 2 seconds" means <code>wait 2 seconds</code> and then go to a random position, and do that over and over again <code>forever</code>.</div>
            </ol>
        </div>
