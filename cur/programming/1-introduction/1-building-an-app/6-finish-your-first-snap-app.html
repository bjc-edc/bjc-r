        	<ul>
                <li>GH Feedback 9/1/15: More scaffolding about the green flag block would have been helpful. Many students didn't even know there was such a block, and the fact that it could be used separately from the "when i am clicked" block was not clear to many. I of course talked about it during class, but it would also be good to have it addressed explicitly in the text.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 9/1/15: The reset button doesn't seem to work without using broadcast - it seems like the clear graphic effects and set ghost effect blocks are sprite specific. None of my students were able to get a reset block to work.<ul><li>BH: Either we teach them broadcast (or TELL) or we flush the example.</li></ul></li>
            </ul>

		<p>In Snap<em>!</em>, a sprite can have more than one script controlling its behavior. You currently have just one script, which runs when you click on Alonzo. Now you'll make a second script that runs when you click on the green flag. The new script will get Alonzo to welcome the player to your game.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Clicking the green flag at the top right, <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button"/>, is one way to start a Snap! script. You can stop all running scripts by clicking the red stop sign, <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="stop button"/>. </div>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
    		<ol>
			    <div class="sidenote">Hint: You can do this using just 3 blocks!</div>
                <li>Create a second script that makes Alonzo move to (190, -130) and <code>say</code> a welcome message whenever the green flag is clicked. (Alonzo might say, "Welcome to Click On Alonzo! Keep clicking me if you can!") . </li>
			    <li>
                	Make that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo.
                	<div class="endnote">Using the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-empty.png" alt="say ()" title="say ()" /> block with an empty input will make the Alonzo sprite stop saying anything.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                	Check that your app does everything you intend it to do:
                	<ul>
                    	<li>When the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should move to (190, -130) and say a welcome message.</li>
                        <li>When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage and face the other way.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
 			</ol>

              <li>
                    So far, Alonzo waits in one place to be clicked. Increase the game's difficulty by adding code so that after the first time he is clicked and from them on, Alonzo moves to a random position on the stage every two seconds (even if not clicked).

                            <li>What does "from then on" translate to in Snap<em>!</em> programming?</li>
                            <li>What does "after the first time Alonzo is clicked" tell you about the structure of the code?</li>
                            <div class="takeNote">Snap<em>!</em> <em>scripts</em> can run at the same time, but <em>within each script, the steps run one at a time</em>.</div>

                </li>
                <li>Give the player some sense of how well they are doing:
                	<ol style="list-style: lower-roman;">
                    	<li>Put <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghost.png" alt="change ghost effect by 5" title="change ghost effect by 5" /> in the script that runs when the player clicks on Alonzo. This makes Alonzo fade out a little every time he's clicked.</li>
                        <li>Put another block in your program to change the ghost effect by -5 every time Alonzo moves without being clicked. </li>
                        <li>Add a reset button by creating a sprite with a reset button costume (made in Snap<em>!</em> or using an imported image) that will <code>clear graphic effects</code> or <code>set ghost effect to 0</code> when clicked.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
