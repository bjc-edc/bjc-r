	<h2>Finishing Your First Snap<em>!</em> App</h2>
        
        <p><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /></p>

		<p>In Snap<em>!</em>, a sprite can have more than one script controlling its behavior. You currently have just one script, which runs when you click on Alonzo. Now you'll make a second script that runs when you click on the green flag. The new script will get Alonzo to welcome the player to your game.</p>
        <div class="endnote">Clicking the green flag at the top right, <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button"/>, is one way to start a Snap! script. You can stop all running scripts by clicking the red stop sign, <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="stop button"/>. </div>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
    		<ol>
			    <div class="sidenote">Hint: You can do this using just 3 blocks!</div>
                <li>Create a second script that makes Alonzo move to (190, -130) and <code>say</code> a welcome message whenever the green flag is clicked. (Alonzo might say, "Welcome to Click On Alonzo! Keep clicking me if you can!") . </li>
			    <li>
                	Make that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo. 
                	<div class="endnote"> You will use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-Hello-World!.png" > block. An empty input will get Alonzo to stop saying whatever he's saying.</div> 
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Where should the <code>Say</code> block go?
                </li>
                <li>
                	Check that your app does everything you intend it to do:
                	<ul>
                    	<li>When the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should move to (190, -130) and say a welcome message.</li>
                        <li>When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage and face the other way.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
 			</ol>
</div>
        
        <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />
        
        <div class="takeItFurther">
    <!--        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />    -->
            <ol type="A">
                <li>The game is too easy if Alonzo just waits in one place to be clicked. If you have extra time, add code so that after the first time Alonzo is clicked, every two seconds he moves to a random position (even if not clicked).</li>
                <div class="endnote"><strong>Translating English into code:</strong> "every 2 seconds" means <code>wait 2 seconds</code> and then go to a random position, and do that over and over again <code>forever</code>.</div>
                <li>It would be good to give the player some sense of how well he or she is doing.  Put this block <br />
                
                  <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghost.png" alt="change ghost effect by 5"> <br />

in the script that runs when the player clicks on Alonzo. This makes Alonzo fade out a little every time he's clicked. Put another block in your program to change the ghost effect by -5 every time Alonzo moves without being clicked.                
            </ol>
        </div>
