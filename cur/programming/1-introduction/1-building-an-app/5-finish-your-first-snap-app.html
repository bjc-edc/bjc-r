        <h2>Improving Your Game</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            There's always something more you can do to make a program better. <strong>On this page,</strong> you'll improve your game by making Alonzo welcome the player when the green flag (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>) is clicked.
        </div>
        <p>
            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-green-flag-clicked-full-size.png" alt="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When 'picture of a green flag' is clicked" title="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When 'picture of a green flag' is clicked"/>
            Clicking the green flag button in the top right corner of the window (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>) starts all scripts that begin with the <code>when green flag is clicked</code> hat block.
            <div class="todo">I think this needs a nod back to both the stop button text and the "events" section on page 3. --MF, 8/12/19</div>
        </p>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
    		<ol>
                <li>If it isn't open already, open your U1L1-ClickAlonzo project.</li>
                <li>
                    <div class="todo">
                        <p>We need to be clearer about what a "second script" is. They don't know what a "script" is at all. Let alone what makes one separate from another. --MF, 8/12/19</p>
                        <p>Also, I don't like the "say (<img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-empty.png" alt="say ()" title="say ()" />)" format, and we don't do it elsewhere. --MF, 8/12/19</p>
                    </div>
                    Create a second script that makes Alonzo say (<img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-empty.png" alt="say ()" title="say ()" />) a welcome message whenever the green flag is clicked. (Alonzo might say, "Welcome to 'Click Alonzo!' Keep clicking me if you can!")
                    <div class="endnote">You can do this using just 3 blocks including the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-greenflag-clicked.png" alt="when green flag clicked" title="when green flag clicked" /> block at the top of the script.<div class="todo">What? I did it in two. Is this counting #3 below or am I missing something? --MF, 8/12/19</div></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo.
                    <div class="endnote">The <code>say</code> block with an empty input will make the sprite say nothing.<div class="todo">I believe this is the first use of "input" so I don't think it's realistic for them to know what an "empty input" is. --MF, 8/12/19</div></div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check that your app does everything you want:
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should welcome the player.</li>
                        <li>When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage and face the other way.</li>
                        <div class="todo">"Facing the other way" has not been discussed. See my notes on page 2. --MF, 8/12/19</div>
                        <li>And from your work on previous pages, every time Alonzo is clicked, he should face the other way and get a little lighter, but he should start to reappear any time he moves without being clicked.</li>
                        <div class="todo">This bullet is repetitive with the previous. It should be "When Alonzo <em>isn't</em> clicked, he should periodically move to a random position and get a little more visible." --MF, 8/12/19</div>
                    </ul>
                </li>
