        <h2>Improving Your Game</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            There's always something more you can do to make a program better. <strong>On this page,</strong> you'll improve your game by making Alonzo welcome the player when the green flag (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>) is clicked.
        </div>

                <p>
                    Clicking the green flag button in the top right corner of the window (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>) starts all scripts that begin with the <code>when green flag is clicked</code> hat block.<br />

                        <p>I don't like the "say (<img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-empty.png" alt="say ()" title="say ()" />)" format, and we don't do it elsewhere. --MF, 8/12/19</p>
                    </div>
                    Create a second script that makes Alonzo say (<img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-empty.png" alt="say ()" title="say ()" />) a welcome message whenever the green flag is clicked. (Alonzo might say, "Welcome to 'Click Alonzo!' Keep clicking me if you can!")

                <li>
                    Make that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo.
                    <div class="endnote">The <code>say</code> block with an empty text in the white <em><strong>input</strong></em> slot will make the sprite say nothing.</div>

                    Check that your app does everything you want:
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should welcome the player.</li>
                        <li>When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage, face the other way, and get more transparent.</li>
                        <li>Alonzo should start to reappear, and shouldn't face the other way, any time he moves without being clicked.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

        <div class="todo">This takeNote color doesn't work, but I wanted to experiment with the idea of having it be the same color as the FYTD becuase we still have too many colors. Thoughts on the idea?  --MF, 11/11/19</div>

            <p>Blocks that look like this can be used to detect an <strong>event</strong> such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>). They tell the script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap<em>!</em> programmers call them "hat blocks."  Using events to control a program is called <em><strong>event-driven programming</strong></em>.</p>

            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-space-key-pressed.png" alt="when (space) key pressed" title="when (space) key pressed" />
            <p>Find these blocks in the yellow Control palette, and see what other choices are in their drop-down menus.</p>
	        <p>Don't think that <em>every</em> script needs a hat block.  You can also run a script by clicking on it.</p>
