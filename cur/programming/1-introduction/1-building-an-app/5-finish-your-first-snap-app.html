        <h2>Improving Your Game</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            There's always something more you can do to make a program better. <strong>On this page,</strong> you'll improve your game by making Alonzo welcome the player when the green flag (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>) is clicked.
        </div>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
    		<ol>
                <li>If it isn't open already, open your U1L1-ClickAlonzo project.</li>
                <div class="todo">This wasn't on the previous pages. I'm not saying it <em>shouldn't</em> be here, but why is this here? --MF, 1/21/20</div>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="todo">I imagine this is here so students get some experience "building an app" before doing this, but it feels a little backwards to build this last (though I could see someone not thinking so---building the core first and whatnot), and it actually breaks the project a bit to do things this way (see my comment on 1.1.4.4). --MF, 1/21/20</div>
        <p>
            Clicking the green flag button in the top right corner of the window (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>) starts all scripts that begin with the <code>when green flag is clicked</code> hat block.<br />

        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="2">
                <li>
                    Create a second script that makes Alonzo <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-empty.png" alt="say ()" title="say ()" /> a welcome message when the green flag is clicked. (Alonzo might say, "Welcome to 'Click Alonzo!' Keep clicking me if you can!")
                    <div class="todo">I'm confused. The whole reason that I'm looking at this lab is because "There's really only one script in the game" per your comment on 2.1.4, and so I went back to remember what came before so as to repair that lab.</div>
                 </li>
                <li>
                    Make that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo.
                    <div class="endnote">The <code>say</code> block with an empty text in the white <em><strong>input</strong></em> slot will make the sprite say nothing.</div>

                <li>
                    Check that your app does everything you want:
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should welcome the player.</li>
                        <li>When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage, face the other way, and get more transparent.</li>
                        <li>Alonzo should start to reappear (but shouldn't face the other way) any time he moves without being clicked.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

        <div class="takeNote">
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-i-am-clicked.png" alt="when i am (clicked)" title="when i am (clicked)" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-green-flag-clicked-full-size.png" alt="when 'green flag' clicked" title="when 'green flag' clicked" />

            <p>Blocks that look like this can be used to detect an <strong>event</strong> such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>). They tell the script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap<em>!</em> programmers call them "hat blocks."  Using events to control a program is called <em><strong>event-driven programming</strong></em>.</p>
	        <p>Not every script needs a hat block; you can also run a script by clicking on it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>Find <code>when I am (clicked)</code> and <code>when (space) key pressed</code> in the yellow Control palette, and see what other choices are in their drop-down menus.</li>
                 <div class="todo">This was a little confusing before since only 2 of the 3 blocks above actually have drop down menus. Also, it seemed odd to have a directive in a TAKENOTE. I know this is a trivial FYTD, but I have bigger issues with this lab (see my comments above), and I could see this getting resolved as those issues are. --MF, 1/21/20</div>
