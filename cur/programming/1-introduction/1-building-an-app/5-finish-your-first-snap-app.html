        <h2>Improving Your Game</h2>
        <div class="todo">Is this page skippable? I think it is except for the orange box, and maybe that has to go here (as they haven't seen whenGFclicked before). So maybe we should revert to the original title, "Greeting the Player" or change it to "Starting the Game" or "Welcoming the Player" or something. --MF, 5/17/19</div>
        <div class="learn">
            There's always something more you can do to make a program better. <strong>On this page,</strong> you'll improve your game by making Alonzo welcome the player when the green flag (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>) is clicked.
        </div>
        <div class="takeNote">
            <img class="imageLeft" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-green-flag-clicked-full-size.png" alt="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When 'picture of a green flag' is clicked" title="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When 'picture of a green flag' is clicked"/>
            <p>Clicking the green flag (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>) starts all scripts that begin with the <code>when green flag is clicked</code> hat block. You can stop all running scripts by clicking the red stop sign (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="stop button" title="stop button" />) at the top right of the Snap<em>!</em> window.</p>

                <li>If it isn't open already, open your U1L1-ClickAlonzo project.</li>
                <li>
                    Create a second script that makes Alonzo <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-empty.png" alt="say ()" title="say ()" /> a welcome message whenever the green flag is clicked. (Alonzo might say, "Welcome to 'Click Alonzo!' Keep clicking me if you can!")
                    <div class="endnote">You can do this using just 3 blocks including the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-greenflag-clicked.png" alt="when green flag clicked" title="when green flag clicked" /> block at the top of the script.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo.
                    <div class="endnote">The <code>say</code> block with an empty input will make the sprite say nothing.</div>

                    Check that your app does everything you want:
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should say his message.</li>
                        <li>When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage and face the other way.</li>
                        <div class="comment">This third bullet was already checked on previous pages, but I thought it worth adding. Do you? --MF, 5/17/19</div>
                        <li>And from your work on previous pages, every time Alonzo is clicked, he should face the other way and get a little lighter, but he should start to reappear any time he moves without being clicked.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
