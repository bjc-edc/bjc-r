        <h2>Improving Your Game</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            There's always something more you can do to make a program better. <strong>On this page,</strong> you'll improve your game by making Alonzo welcome the player when the green flag (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>) is clicked.
        </div>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
    		<ol>
                <li>If it isn't open already, open your U1L1-ClickAlonzo project.</li>
                <p>
                    Clicking the green flag button in the top right corner of the window (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>) starts all scripts that begin with the <code>when green flag is clicked</code> hat block.<br />
                    <div class="todo">I think this needs a nod back to both the stop button text and the "events" section on page 3. --MF, 8/12/19</div>
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-green-flag-clicked-full-size.png" alt="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When 'picture of a green flag' is clicked" title="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When 'picture of a green flag' is clicked"/>
                </p>
                <li>
                    <div class="todo">
                        <p>I don't like the "say (<img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-empty.png" alt="say ()" title="say ()" />)" format, and we don't do it elsewhere. --MF, 8/12/19</p>
                    </div>
                    Create a second script that makes Alonzo say (<img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-empty.png" alt="say ()" title="say ()" />) a welcome message whenever the green flag is clicked. (Alonzo might say, "Welcome to 'Click Alonzo!' Keep clicking me if you can!")
                 </li>
                <li>
                    Make that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo.
                    <div class="endnote">The <code>say</code> block with an empty text in the white <em><strong>input</strong></em> slot will make the sprite say nothing.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check that your app does everything you want:
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should welcome the player.</li>
                        <li>When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage, face the other way, and get more transparent.</li>
                        <li>Alonzo should start to reappear, and shouldn't face the other way, any time he moves without being clicked.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />
