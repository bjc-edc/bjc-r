		<p>Many professional programmers use a technique called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" title="Wikipedia: Pair programming" target="_blank">pair programming</a>&mdash;writing computer programs in teams of two. One partner controls the computer, and the other helps plan and helps catch errors. <em><strong>They switch roles often.</strong></em></p>
		<p>In this course, you will do that too. Aim for equal time in each role.</p>
