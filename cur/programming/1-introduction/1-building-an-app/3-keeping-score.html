        <div class="learn">
        	<p>
                <strong>On this page,</strong> you'll make your app more like a game. Alonzo will start to move on his own making it harder to click him, and each time the player clicks on Alonzo, he will become a little lighter. The goal of the game is to click on Alonzo until he disappears.<br />
                <div class="comment">We could probably make a better video that looks clearer and makes the app seem more exciting. Also, need a 1 sec pause on both the first and last frames. --MF, 5/17/19</div>

            <ol>
                <li>
                	To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says "do this forever."  And there is a block that does that:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever.png" alt="forever" title="forever" /><br />
                    Modify your Alonzo script so that it keeps going:<br /> 
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alonzo-code-too-fast.png" alt="when I am (clicked) {
    next costume
    forever {
        go to (random position)
    }
}" title="when I am (clicked) {
    next costume
    forever {
        go to (random position)
    }
}" />
                    <div class="endnote">The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you click the red stop sign (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="red stop button" title="red stop button"/>) or stop that script in some other way.</div>
                </li>
                <li>Alonzo moves too fast. Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs" /> block to slow him down. You can increase or reduce the wait time if you like.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeNote">
            <img class="imageLeft" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/hat-block.png" alt="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When" title="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When"/>
            <p>Blocks that look like this can be used to detect an <strong>event</strong> such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>). They tell the script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap<em>!</em> programmers call them "hat blocks." </p>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-I-am-clicked.png" alt="when i am (clicked)" title="when i am (clicked)" />

            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-space-key-pressed.png" alt="when (space) key pressed" title="when (space) key pressed" />
            <p>Find these blocks in the yellow Control palette, and see what other choices are in their drop-down menus.</p>
	    <p>Don't think that <em>every</em> script needs a hat block.  You can also run a script by clicking on it.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
                <li>The command <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghosteffect.png" alt="ghost effect" title="ghost effect" /> controls Alonzo's brightness. Drag the block into the center Scripts area, and experiment with different inputs (clicking it again after each change) to see exactly what it does.</li>    
                <li>Then, modify your script so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little lighter.</li>
                <li>
                    <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
                    Put another block somewhere in your program to <code>change ghost effect by -5</code> any time Alonzo moves <em>without</em> being clicked. How does this change the gameplay?
                </li>
                <li>Play your game a few times. Adjust your code to get a level of difficulty that you like.</li>
                <div class="endnote">You can use the ghost effect and the wait time to make the game easier or harder.</div>
