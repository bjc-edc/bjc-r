        <div class="todo">
        JK: Next year, include more about what bits are using this powerpoint to talk about the explosion more clearly: <a href="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/2015Sp-CS10-L21-DG-Data_amount.pdf">Slides from UC Berkeley</a> (Perhaps go in and edit the powerpoint itself to get rid of, for example, "(Cal)Clicker". Dan provides b/w as well as ppt files as well - perhaps for teachers?)

        <h3>What does Tanya Rider's story have to do with the explosion of bits?</h3>

                    Read <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=19" target="_blank"><em>Blown to Bits</em> pages 1-4</a>. As you read, be prepared to discuss the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>According to the authors, what are some things that have changed as a result of computers?</li>
                        <li>What do the authors mean by "explosion of bits"?</li>

                <li>Police couldn't access Tanya Rider's records because of her right to privacy. Is there a way to make a policy that preserves one's right to privacy and also makes sure a person like Tanya Rider gets rescued? Write down three arguments for each of the following positions.
                <ul>
                  <li>Position A: The right to privacy isn't just an abstract principle. Sometimes, for example, women disappear to hide from abusive husbands. The police can't assume they are getting the whole story when a person is reported missing. They have to follow the rules even if that delays some rescues. Also, maybe it's the police that the person is trying to avoid!</li>
                    <li>Position B: The police should be able to check the location of a phone right away to search for a missing person, perhaps with a rule that they can't use the information for any other purpose, or disclose it to anyone, without permission from a court.</li>
                </ul>
                Is there a third policy that protects <em>everyone's</em> needs?</li>
