            <ul>
                <li>MF: teachers can assign #2 here as journal entry for HW, a book report, or even as 1 or 7 quizzes/pop quizzes throughout the unit; students could produce, poesters, video of skits, or just do quick readings to the class; these could be group discussion prompts, etc... Perhaps we could leave this to the teacher's discretion... (Jane suggests being very specific instead) (BH: give a screenful of reading and then some discussion prompts/questions)</li>
                <li>MF: let's add an example dialogue for one or more of the koans</li>
                <li>MF: we need a structured way to do the reading.</li> 
                <li>As an example: <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/5-search-and-data/big-questions.html">/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/5-search-and-data/big-questions.html</a></li>
