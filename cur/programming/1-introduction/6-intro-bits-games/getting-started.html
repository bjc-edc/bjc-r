            <ol>
                <li>Think about your relationship with technology. Write a short "technology autobiography" describing your relationship. Consider answering some or all of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>How long have you been using technology?</li>
                    <li>How do you currently use technology?</li>
                    <li>What are three adjectives you would use to describe your relationship?</li>
                    <li>What about technology would you like to explore further?</li>
                </ul> <!--How do you interact with computers and digital media? Write a paragraph describing ways you use technology.--> <!--<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oboPDqZ9cNtJ_3fIFVPkfKAPPQkHo7TSKSULbB1CjgA/edit" target="_blank">Google doc</a>--></li>
            </ol>
        </div>
 <div class="takeItFurther"><p>What counts as technology, anyway?</p>
 <ul><li>Is a pencil technology?</li>
 <li>Is food technology?<ul><li>Is a fresh banana technology?</li>
 <li>Is a frozen dinner technology?</li></ul></li></ul>
 <p>People often use the word to mean <em>electronic</em> technology, or <em>digital</em> technology.  Why?  What's special about those?</p>
