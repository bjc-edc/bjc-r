		<h2>Adding an Input</h2>
        <div class="sidenote">
        	You've seen many blocks that take an input variable:<br />

        </div>
        <p>You have just created blocks that draw something (a square, a triangle, a house, etc.) of a certain size by giving your block an <em>input</em> that tells your blocks what size image you want to draw.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>To edit a block, right-click (or two-finger-click) on it (either in the palette or in a script) and select "edit" to open it in the block editor.</p>
                    <img class="indent" title="Editing the 'draw square' block" alt="Editing the 'draw square' block" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/edit-current-block.png" >
                </li>
                <li>   
	                <div class="sidenote">Another common word for <em>input</em> in mathematics and computer science is <em>argument</em>. </div>

                    <p>In the "Block Editor," hover your cursor over the words and plus signs (<b>+</b>) in the hat block.</p>
                    <p>Clicking on a word will let you change that word; clicking on a <b>+</b> will let you add something in that position. You want to add an input after the title, so click on the <b>+</b> at the end.</p>
                    <img class="indent" alt="draw square editor" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/draw-square-block-editor.png" >

                    <p>
                    	You have two choices about what you want to add or modify to the block definition:
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Title text</strong> (grey in this picture) will let you add a word or words to the block's title. (For example, if you wanted to change the name of the block from <code>draw square</code> to <code>draw square picture</code> you'd click on "Title text" and type the word "picture" into the text box.)</li>
                            <li><strong>Input name</strong> (selected in this picture ) will let you add an <i>input</i>. This is what you want now, and it is selected by default any time you open this dialog.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>Give the input a name that makes its meaning clear to any reader: <code>size</code> or <code>sideLength</code> would be good.  Type that name in the input field and click "OK."</p>
                </li></ol></div>
                <div>
                Your block title has changed: there is now a variable named <code>size</code> at the end of the title.<br />

                <div class="forYouToDo"> <ol start="4">
                <li> <div class="sidenote">This is exactly what you did when you used the variable in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-control-commands/4-the-for-block.html">the <code>for</code> block</a>.</div>
            
                    <p><a name="drawsquare" class="anchor"></a>To use the <code>size</code> variable within the <code>draw square</code> block, drag the variable <code>size</code> down into the move block.

					<p>When you click "OK" in the block editor, you'll see that the <code>draw square</code> block in the scripting area now takes an argument. Run this script with a few different inputs to check that it works:</p>

                <li>
                    Create a <code>draw polygon</code> block that takes two inputs:
                    <ul>
                        <li>a number of sides (call the variable <code>sides</code>)</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Be sure to test out your solution with several polygons with different lengths and number of sides.</p>

                	You may wish to review <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-control-commands/4-the-for-block.html">how you nested squares in squares</a>. Create a new procedure called <code>nested polygons</code> with two or three levels of nesting and inputs that tell how many <code>sides</code> and what side <code>length</code> to use. 
               	 <div class="endnote">You might want also to add a third input that tells by what factor to reduce the size of the nested polygons so that you can easily experiment with different reductions.</div>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
