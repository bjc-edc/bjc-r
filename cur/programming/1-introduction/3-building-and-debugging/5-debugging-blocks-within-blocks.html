    	<h2>Debugging Blocks within Blocks</h2>
	    <p>One potential challenge in building custom blocks that use other custom blocks is that a custom block works fine on its own, but when it's used inside another custom block, something goes wrong.</p>
        <p>
        	Here is an example. A programmer intended to draw five squares in a row, like this: <img class="noshaddow" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/5-squares-in-row.png" alt="five squares in a row" title="five squares in a row" />, and built this script:
        	<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/five-squares-in-row.png" alt="repeat (5) (draw square (20), move (20) steps)" title="repeat (5) (draw square (20), move (20) steps)" />
        </p>
        <p>
       	  Of course, it required a <code>draw square</code> block with an input <code>size</code>, so the programmer created this definition:<br />
        	<div class="sidenoteBig">This <code>draw square (size)</code> script makes one square of size 20, as expected, when it is called with 20 as the input.</div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-square-(size).png" alt="draw square (size): move (size) steps, turn right 90 degrees, move (size) steps, turn right 90 degrees, move (size) steps, turn right 90 degrees, move (size) steps" title="draw square (size): move (size) steps, turn right 90 degrees, move (size) steps, turn right 90 degrees, move (size) steps, turn right 90 degrees, move (size) steps" />
        </p>
        
        <p>But instead of getting the desired picture of five squares in a row like <img class="noshaddow" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/5-squares-in-row.png" alt="five squares in a row" title="five squares in a row" />, the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/five-squares-in-row.png" alt="repeat (5) (draw square (20), move (20) steps)" title="repeat (5) (draw square (20), move (20) steps)" /> script draws <img class="noshaddow" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/4-squares-around-square.png" alt="4 squares around a square" title="4 squares around a square" />.</p>
        <!--<p>This is a problem with the composition of blocks. The issue occues because the <code>draw square</code> block designed here is not state independent.</p>-->

                    Right!
