        <h2>Expressions and Operations</h2>
        <div class="todo">
        	From Al, 6/21/16:
            <ul>
            	<li>``In order to calculate the starting place of the sprite that draws the boardgame, you'll need some math, ''</li>
                <li>``you'll need some {\bf mathematics}''.</li>
                <li>Problem 1:  Do we need to say (via a sidenote) that they can check their answers with snap! or will they know that?</li>
                <li>Problem 3:  Mary's OK with the graphic?  :-)</li>
                <li>Problem 4:  It's just too easy to check with snap!.  Maybe ask them to find numbers larger than 100 that are 0 mod 2.  Something like that.  And maybe ask them to experiment with mod 3.  It's all too easy to think that mod reports even and odd.</li>
                <li>Orange box:  ``n is divisible by 2 (meaning n is even) and false if n is odd (not divisible by 2 and so the remainder is not 0)''  The font for ``n'' needs to be in mathematics mode.</li>
                <li>Problem 6:  The instructions ``Experiment to find how to calculate the tile size based on the number of tiles'' don't make sense.  It assumes they  want to fit a board with any number of squares inside the same large square, but there's no way to know this.  You could just eliminate the opening sentence above and start with the first bullet (shouldn't these parts be numbered or lettered?).  But it's still not clear why they'd want to do this (yet).  Why would I want all my boards to be the same overall size?</li>
                <li>ITT:  ``If you like, have the X sprite give some message, like "To play Tic Tac Toe, drag me onto the board."''  isn't this previewed in the demo on page 1?  Maybe say that.</li>
            </ul>
            From Mary, 10.20.16:
            <ul>
            	<li>I think all of the TTT stuff on this page should be Teacher's Choice (i.e., #5-8). It feels like we are making things unnecessarily complicated.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            In order to calculate the starting place of the sprite that draws the boardgame, you'll need some math, but <span class="snap">snap</span> can do the calculations for you. Operations such as 
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/plus.png" alt="addition" title="addition" />
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/minus.png"  alt="subtraction" title="subtraction" />
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/axb.png"  alt="multiplication" title="multiplication" />
            and <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/divide.png"  alt="division" title="division" />
            report the result of their calculations, so they are called <strong>reporter blocks</strong>. You can nest them inside each other to create more complicated expressions:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/(5+4)x3.png" alt="(5 + 4) times 3"> because <span class="katex">(5+4)\cdot 3=9 \cdot 3=27</span><!-- &nbsp;=&nbsp; &nbsp;(5 + 4) &middot; 3 &nbsp;=&nbsp; 9  &middot; 3&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; &nbsp;27-->

                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Experiment with <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/round-a-number.png" alt="round a number"> by giving it inputs like <code>round (3.14)</code> and <code>round (401.9)</code>. </li>

                </li>
                <li>Now <em>predict</em> (without using <span class="snap">snap</span>) what <code>(23) mod (2)</code> will report.</li>
            </ol>
		</div>

		<div class="takeNote">
            <p>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mod.png" alt="() mod ()"/> block <strong>reports the remainder</strong> when the first input is divided by the second. For example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/17-mod-5.png" alt="17 mod 5" title="17 mod 5" /> reports 2 because when 17 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2. When one number divides another evenly, the remainder is 0. So, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/15-mod-5.png" alt="15 mod 5" title="15 mod 5" /> reports 0.</p>
            <p>The Boolean expression <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/n-mod-2=0.png" alt="n mod 2 = 0" title="n mod 2 = 0" /> reports <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true" title="true" /> if <var>n</var> is divisible by 2 (meaning <var>n</var> is even) and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false" title="false" /> if <var>n</var> is odd (not divisible by 2 and so the remainder is not 0).</p>
