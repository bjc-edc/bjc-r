                <li>Police couldn't access Tanya Rider's records because of her right to privacy. <strong>Is there a way to make a policy that preserves one's right to privacy and also makes sure a person like Tanya Rider gets rescued?</strong> Write down three arguments for each of the following positions.
                <ul>
                  <li>Position A: The right to privacy isn't just an abstract principle. Sometimes for example, people disappear to hide from people who might hurt them. When a person is reported missing, the police can't assume that's the whole story; they have to follow the rules even if that delays some rescues. Also, maybe that person is trying to avoid the police!</li>
                    <li>Position B: The police should be able to check the location of a phone right away to search for a missing person, perhaps with a rule that they can't use the information for any other purpose, or disclose it to anyone, without permission from a court.</li>
                </ul>
                Is there a third policy that protects <em>everyone's</em> needs?</li>
