        <p>JK: Next year, include <strong>more about what bits are</strong> using this powerpoint to <strong>talk about the explosion more clearly</strong>: <a href="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/2015Sp-CS10-L21-DG-Data_amount.pdf" target="_blank">Slides from UC Berkeley</a> (Perhaps go in and edit the powerpoint itself to get rid of, for example, &quot;(Cal)Clicker&quot;. Dan provides b/w as well as ppt files as well - perhaps for teachers?)</p>
        <p>I started to do this, and then I decided that it odesn&apos;t belong on this page. --MF, 3/31/17</p>

        	Data is ubiquitous; we work with it all the time. Throughout your life, data about you is collected, stored, copied, shared,  edited, and sometimes deleted. We  measure  data using bits and bytes. Data size impacts storage space and transmission times.
            <ul>
            	<li>1 bit = a zero or a one</li>
                <li>1 byte = 8 bits</li>
                <li>1 kilobyte (KB or KiB) = 1024 bytes (one paragraph of text)</li>
                <li>1 megabyte (MB or MiB)  = 1024 KiB (a four megapixel JPEG-compressed image)</li>
                <li>1 gigabyte (GB or GiB) = 1024 MiB (one hour of SD TV or seven minutes of HDTV)</li>
                <li>1 terabyte (TB or TiB) = 1024 GiB (2,000 hours of uncompressed audio or 17,000 hours of MP3s)</li>
                <li>1 petabyte (PB or PiB) = 1024 TiB (enough space to store the DNA of the entire population of the US three times)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p>Netflix is said to use 1 PB to store the videos for streaming. </p>
            <p>World of Warcraft is stored on 1.3PB to maintain the game. </p>
            <p>Internet Archive: About 10PB </p>
            <p>AT&amp;T transfers about 30PB of data through its networks each day. </p>
            <p>YouTube processes about 40PB of videos a day. </p>
            <p>Multimedia data is the biggest data! </p>

                <li>Police couldn&apos;t access Tanya Rider&apos;s records because of her right to privacy. <strong>Is there a way to make a policy that preserves one&apos;s right to privacy and also makes sure a person like Tanya Rider gets rescued?</strong> Write down three arguments for each of the following positions.
                <ul>
                  <li>Position A: The right to privacy isn&apos;t just an abstract principle. Sometimes for example, people disappear to hide from people who might hurt them. When a person is reported missing, the police can&apos;t assume that&apos;s the whole story; they have to follow the rules even if that delays some rescues. Also, maybe that person is trying to avoid the police!</li>
                    <li>Position B: The police should be able to check the location of a phone right away to search for a missing person, perhaps with a rule that they can&apos;t use the information for any other purpose, or disclose it to anyone, without permission from a court.</li>
                </ul>
                Is there a third policy that protects <em>everyone&apos;s</em> needs?</li>
