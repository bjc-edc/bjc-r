        <h2>Examining Privacy</h2>
        <div class="learn">
	        <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will discuss why privacy is good to protect, identify threats to your privacy, and consider reasons you might choose to give up privacy. </p>

        <p>The search engine you use (probably Google if you haven't thought very hard about privacy) obviously knows what questions you ask it.  Less obviously, it also knows which links you actually click on.  Even less obviously than that, it knows which links you <em>hover your mouse over, and for how long.</em></p>

            <div id="hint-Google" class="collapse">
                <p>Have you ever had to click inside a circle "to prove you're a human being"?  The way it works is by recording how you move the mouse around the page, not just as you're reaching for that circle to click, but the entire time you're visiting the page.  Each person has a different habitual mouse style.  Google, which owns the company that offers the service to web sites, keeps records for each person about how they move the mouse, as a sort of digital-era fingerprint.  Of course, if you have a Gmail account, then Google reads your email, too.  (They are quick to point out that no <em>people</em> at Google read your mail; it's just computer programs.  Still, that information is part of your digital dossier, so Google knows whom you love, and what you say to each other.)  Google also provides cloud storage of your contacts and your calendar, if you have an Android phone.  (If you have an iPhone, then it's Apple that collects your contacts and calendar.)</p>

        <div class="comment">IOC-2.A.6</div>
        <p>What does Google do with the information it collects about you?  The most obvious thing is that they use it for targeted advertising.  Less obvious, and even worse, is that they use it to decide which search results to show you. </p>
        <div class="endnote">They do this mainly so that you'll appreciate how easy it is to find the results you want.  For example, if you always buy books online from Amazon, but I always use Powell's Books, then when we search for the same book, you'll get Amazon as the first link but I'll get Powell's.  That's not a big problem, but this is:  If I get my news from the liberal New York Times, and you get your news from the conservative Fox News, then over time, I'll see only the ideas I already agree with, and you'll see the ones you already agree with, very different from mine.  This situation is called a <em>search bubble.</em>  We're stuck in two different bubbles, not because Google wants to prevent us seeing each other's ideas, but because the same algorithms that give each of us our favorite bookstore also gives each of us our favorite news source.</div>
	
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>As a class, choose a politically controversial topic. Then, not in class but on the computer you usually use outside of school (so that your Google dossier is connected with that computer), do a search for that topic. Save the results you get, and at next class meeting see if everyone got the same results.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="comment">IOC-2.A.8</div>
        <p>Both the targeted advertising and the search bubbling can be viewed as being in your interest.  If you're going to see advertising, isn't it better for you to see advertising that's likely to be relevant to you?  You might actually want to buy what's on offer.  Similarly, if Google knows where you are right now, it can suggest restaurants you like, or restaurants that are <em>similar</em> to ones you like and that are near here (and ones that pay Google for promoting them).  The same reasoning applies to other big tech companies. Don't you want Netflix to recommend things you might like to watch?</p>
        <p>Many people find targeting useful up to a point and beyond that point call it "creepy."  People draw the line at different places, but, for example, some people are happy with "Hey, it's lunch time and you're near Caf√© Gratitude, where you've eaten before.  Should I call them and order your usual?" but find "... and your friend Paul is there right now" creepy.</p>

        <p>Many people find it convenient that sites that sell things, such as Amazon, remember your credit card number so you don't have to type it in every time. Similarly, most people are happy for their browser to remember their password for each web site. But credit card numbers and passwords are among the PII that you most want to keep protected against thieves.  You're relying on the seller or the company that makes your browser not to have any security bugs, and you're also relying on them not to misuse your PII themselves.</p>

        <p>Your cell phone carrier is the biggest threat to your online privacy because it sees <em>everything</em> you do on your phone.  You can choose to use a different search engine, but you don't have many choices of cell phone carrier; it's probably ATT, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.  A particularly important kind of information that your phone knows is your physical location.  You can turn off the sharing of your location with other companies, but you can't block your carrier from knowing your location because your carrier has to know which cell tower you're using and where that tower is. And the information collected isn't just your location <em>right now,</em> but the entire history of where you've been since you got that phone.</p>

        <p>You may think that Facebook doesn't know anything about you because you don't have a Facebook account, but Facebook keeps dossiers even on non-users.  It finds out about you because a friend on Facebook has you as a contact in their phone, or because your friend posted a photo that includes you, perhaps from an email that you intended for that person alone. (Facebook doesn't even need your name with the photo, because it has a massive database of photographed faces and names.)  And once the information is on the net, many people may keep or redistribute copies (e.g., "retweeting").   Of course, every website records who visited it, but if the site has a "Like" button, Facebook also knows who visited it&mdash;even if they don't click the button. And the special danger of social media sites like Facebook is that <em>anyone</em> can read the information shown, not just the big tech companies.</p>

                    Identify one area in your life in which you purposely give up privacy. What are the risks? Why have <em>you</em> decided that the benefits outweigh the risks?

        <p>In the early days of the Internet, the hackers who designed it didn't trust the government, so they tried to make sure that the police couldn't get your browsing history without a warrant signed by a judge. That all changed on 9/11/2001, when the World Trade Center was destroyed by hijacked airplanes crashing into its towers.  Congress quickly passed the "Patriot Act," a huge collection of permissions for police and other government agencies to collect data about you.  These days, many experts believe that the Patriot Act went too far in weakening privacy, but it's very hard to change it because politicians are afraid their opponents will say they're weak on terrorism if they vote to remove some of the privacy holes in the law.</p>
        <div class="comment">IOC-2.A.10</div>
        <p>Another big change in our understanding of the government's interest in the Internet came in 2013, when Edward Snowden, working for a contractor with the National Security Agency (NSA), leaked a large collection of NSA internal documents showing how the NSA and other agencies "listen in" on your digital conversations and actions, often illegally even under the loose Patriot Act rules.  This led to widespread disapproval of the U.S. government spying on Americans (instead of spying on other countries, which is their job) and also raised concerns in other countries. This is economically important because people outside the U.S. don't want to do business with companies that store data in the U.S.</p>
