            <p>PG: For comments on social implications, see generic comment at end of Unit 8: All social implications:  I have not commented on any, mostly because I like them as is (but with text editing) and felt I had nothing (important) to add. In general, they're not overly wordy, and the content is thought-provoking and good for discussion, so the real management is in the teacher's hand (and TG) not requiring much more curriculum edits from us. Of course, they deserve a careful re-read to clean up the text and to tighten some of the longer ones. As for the controversies (e.g., on 5.5.2, computers and war), I've stayed silent, but my own position (for what it is worth) is that our job is—as I've argued in the programming labs, too—to be educative/informational and think about what is to be learned, not just about what we want to "teach." I don't think we should  be scared of a topic because it raises controversy, but I do think we need to find a way that doesn't saddle a teacher with situations they can't handle. Consistent with my comments on programming labs that it is not our job to show how smart we are but to show how smart kids can be, I also think that WE should be careful with the language we use so that it does not implicitly suggest our point of view. (It is impossible to be "neutral"—I'm not recommending that—but we must work hard to be informationally correct without being propagandistic. To me, some of the language we've used and the claims we make feel expressive of our own orientation, not just correct information.) </p>

        <h3>What Information is Out There about You?</h3>
		<div class="comment">IOC-1.F.11 bullet 3, IOC-2.A.5</div>
        <p>If you post a picture of you and your friends to a website, you are making information public about where you were and what you were doing. This may violate both your own privacy and that of your friends. Also, if your phone is lost or stolen, someone else might get access to pictures or messages you thought were private. That's why data on cell phones is normally <em>encrypted</em> so that it can't be recovered without your password. Having to type your password is a trade-off between convenience and security.  But some recent research has shown that cell phone apps are often written to collect information about you and your contacts and location without your knowledge, mostly to sell targeted advertising.</p>

        <p>There are some benefits to PII being shared online. For example, it can be used to enhance your online experiences (such as to show you personalized movie recommendations), and it can also simplify online purchasing (such as by suggesting things you are likely to buy based on previous purchases).

            <p><strong>Personally identifiable information</strong> (PII) is information that might make it possible for someone to figure out who you are, when you're trying not to allow that, such as your Social Security number, age, race, phone number(s), medical information, financial information, or biometric data (such as your thumbprint or face scan).</p>

        <p>One reason you are asked to choose a <em>username</em> when you get a Snap<em>!</em> account is to give you the freedom to talk about political issues or emotional issues for you, without tying those conversations to your actual identity.</p>

            <div id="hint-laws" class="collapse">
                <p>In the United States, the law says that web sites must have a <em>privacy policy</em> that spells out what the site will do with the information you give them.  This is a pretty weak protection; the privacy policies are typically really long, and written by lawyers, so it's hard to find out what information they collect and what they do with it.  In Europe, there is now a <em>General Data Protection Regulation</em> (GDPR) that spells out what counts as PII, and says that web sites can't do certain things, regardless of what they put in their privacy policies, without your <em>affirmative</em> permission (you have to say yes, not merely not say no), and that they can't deny otherwise free services to you because of your refusal to permit the use they want you to agree to.</p>
	            <p>The GDPR is new enough that its implications are still being worked out.  For example, to get a Snap<em>!</em> account, you have to provide an email address, your own or your parent's depending on your age.  That's the only thing Snap<em>!</em> knows about you: not your name, not your home address, just your email address.  Is that PII?  Some lawyers think it is.  Other lawyers think that your email <em>alone</em> isn't PII, but it is when combined with certain other information.  If it's PII, then Snap<em>!</em> has to ask if you're in Europe; if so, it has to collect <em>more</em> information about you, such as your name, age, and address, to be able to satisfy some of the GDPR requirements.  Your age matters, clearly, because the rules are different for children and adults.  (In Europe, the cutoff age is 16, whereas in the US, we have to ask for your parent's email if you're below 13.)  The rest of the PII we have to know is to satisfy the requirement that if you ask to have your account deleted, we must do so <em>at once.</em>  So we have to be able to make sure that it's really you, or your parent, asking, not some friend wanting to delete your account as a prank.</p>

	<p>But <em>any</em> information you put online can be used against you.  Imagine you send an email to your best friend saying "I really hate my computer science teacher."  Your friend puts your message on their own Facebook page, where your teacher sees it.  That could be embarassing.  And once you've sent it, you can't be sure to erase every copy of it.</p>

                If you're like most people, when you are on a computer you use a web browser (such as Chrome, Safari, Edge) to connect to all websites you visit.  But on your phone, you may have a separate app installed for some sites (such as Instagram or Facebook). From a privacy point of view, using a browser is <em>much</em> better.
                <ul>
                    <li>In a browser, you can install privacy extensions (such as AdBlockPlus, Ghostery, or NoScript) that restrict the ability of web sites to gather your information.  With a site-specific app, there's no mechanism to let you change how it works.</li>
                    <li>On a computer, when you exit from a browser, it stops running.  (This doesn't <em>have</em> to be true, but when a browser company tries to get around that rule, someone catches them at it, and people stop using that browser for a while.)  But almost all phone apps keep running even when you're not using them, and many of them are constantly accessing your contacts, messages, and other data and sending that information over the Internet to the company that made the app.  That company may even be in a country with very weak privacy protection.</li>
                    <li>On a computer, the standard thing is to store your information on the computer's own hard drive.  On a phone, the standard thing is to store your information in "the cloud," i.e., on computers belonging to your cell phone carrier (Verizon, ATT, etc.) or the phone manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, Google, etc.).</li>

        <div class="sidenoteBig">There are even companies whose sole business is to collect information about you from other companies, large or small, that you use online.  But the biggest data gatherers are Google, cell phone carriers, Facebook, and the US government.</div>
        <p>"What does organization X know about you?" is kind of a trick question because many of these companies and institutions <em>share the information they collect about you</em>. The sharing of data among different companies is important&mdash;and problematic&mdash;because different kinds of information, while each unimportant separately, can turn into a serious privacy problem when combined. For example, your cell phone carrier knows everyplace you go while Google knows what people or businesses live at every address; in combination, these two kinds of information can reveal whether you've visiting a divorce lawyer, an AIDS doctor, or other possibilities that could be embarrassing (or worse) if revealed.</p>

        <div class="comment">IOC-2.A.2</div>
        <p>The search engine you use (probably Google if you haven't thought very hard about privacy) obviously knows what questions you ask it.  Less obviously, it also knows which links you actually click on.  Even less obviously than that, it knows which links you <em>hover your mouse over, and for how long.</em></p>

                <p>Have you ever had to click inside a circle "to prove you're a human being"?  The way it works is by recording how you move the mouse around the page, not just as you're reaching for that circle to click, but the entire time you're visiting the page.  Each person has a different habitual mouse style.  Google, which owns the company that offers the service to web sites, keeps records for each person about how they move the mouse, as a sort of digital-era fingerprint.  Of course, if you have a Gmail account, then Google reads your email, too.  (They are quick to point out that no <em>people</em> at Google read your mail; it's just computer programs.  Still, that information is part of your digital dossier, so Google knows whom you love, and what you say to each other.)  Google also provides cloud storage of your contacts and your calendar, if you have an Android phone.  (If you have an iPhone, then it's Apple that collects your contacts and calendar.)</p>

        <p>What does Google do with the information it collects about you?  The most obvious thing is that they use it for targeted advertising.  Less obvious, and even worse, is that they use it to decide which search results to show you. </p>
        <div class="endnote">They do this mainly so that you'll appreciate how easy it is to find the results you want.  For example, if you always buy books online from Amazon, but I always use Powell's Books, then when we search for the same book, you'll get Amazon as the first link but I'll get Powell's.  That's not a big problem, but this is:  If I get my news from the liberal New York Times, and you get your news from the conservative Fox News, then over time, I'll see only the ideas I already agree with, and you'll see the ones you already agree with, very different from mine.  This situation is called a <em>search bubble.</em>  We're stuck in two different bubbles, not because Google wants to prevent us seeing each other's ideas, but because the same algorithms that give each of us our favorite bookstore also gives each of us our favorite news source.</div>
	
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="4">
                <li>Try this: Not in class, but on the computer you usually use outside of school (so that your Google dossier is connected with that computer) do a search for some politically controversial topic, such as "Donald Trump."  Save the results you get, and next class meeting see if everyone got the same results.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
	<div class="comment">IOC-2.A.8</div>
	<p>Both the targeted advertising and the search bubbling can be viewed as being in your interest.  If you're going to see advertising, isn't it better for you to see advertising that's likely to be relevant to you?  You might actually want to buy what's on offer.  Similarly, if Google knows where you are right now, it can suggest restaurants you like, or restaurants that are <em>similar</em> to ones you like and that are near here (and that pay Google for promoting them).  The same reasoning applies to other big tech companies.  Don't you want Amazon to show you things like the things you've bought, or looked at, before?</p>
	<p>Many people find targeting useful up to a point, and beyond that point call it "creepy."  People draw the line at different places, but, for example, some people are happy with "Hey, it's lunch time and you're near Yet Wah, where you've eaten before.  Should I call them and order your usual?" but find "... and your friend Paul is there right now" creepy.</p>
	<div class="comment">IOC-2.A.9,10</div>
	<p>One use of PII that almost everyone finds much too convenient to give up is that sites that sell things, such as Amazon, remember your credit card number so you don't have to type it in every time.  A similar example is that most people are happy for their browser to remember their password for each web site.  And yet credit card numbers and passwords are among the PII that you most want to keep protected against thieves.  You're relying on the seller or the company that makes your browser not to have any security bugs, and you're also relying on them not to misuse your PII themselves.</p>
	<div class="comment">IOC-2.A.4,14</div>
	<p>Your carrier is the biggest threat to your online privacy, because it sees <em>everything</em> you do on your phone.  You can choose to use a different search engine, but you don't have many choices of cell phone carrier; it's probably ATT, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile.  A particularly important kind of information that your phone knows is your physical location.  You can turn off the sharing of your location with other companies, but you can't turn off the collection of location information because your phone finds a cell tower near you, and your carrier has to know which tower you're using, and where that tower is; and because you have to be able to call 911 and they have to know where to come rescue you.  Don't forget that what's online isn't just your location <em>right now,</em> but the entire history of where you've been since you got a cell phone.  Programs know how long you spent at a particular place, and maybe how you got there and back.</p>
	<div class="comment">IOC-2.A.3,15</div>
	<p>You may think that Facebook doesn't know anything about you, because you don't have a Facebook account.  Alas, that's not good enough, because Facebook keeps dossiers even on non-users.  It finds out about you because a friend on Facebook has you as a contact, or because your friend posted a photo that includes you, captioned with your name.  (Lately, it doesn't even need the name, because it has a massive database of photographed faces.)  Facebook also knows if you click a "Like" button on any web site -- or even if you don't click the button, because when you loaded the page with the button, Facebook was notified.  The special danger of social media sites like Facebook is that <em>anyone</em> can read the information shown, not just the big tech companies.</p>
	<p>As for the government, in the early days of the Internet, the (mostly young, white, male) hackers who designed it didn't trust the government, so they tried to make sure, for example, that the police can't get your browsing history without a warrant signed by a judge.  That all changed on 9/11/2001, when the World Trade Center was destroyed by hijacked airplanes crashing into its towers.  Congress quickly passed the "Patriot Act," a huge collection of permissions for police and other government agencies to collect data about you.  These days, many experts believe that the Patriot Act went too far in weakening privacy, but it's very hard to change it, because politicians are afraid their opponents in an election will say they're weak in anti-terrorism if they vote to remove some of the privacy holes in the law.</p>
	<p>Another big change in our understanding of the government's interest in the Internet came in 2013, when Edward Snowden, working for a contractor with the National Security Agency, leaked a large collection of NSA internal documents showing how the NSA and other agencies "listen in" on your digital conversations and actions, often illegally, even under the loose Patriot Act rules.  This led to widespread disapproval of government spying on Americans (instead of spying on other countries, which is their job), and also raising concerns in other countries.  For example, the world's main providers of cloud computing are Google, Amazon, and Microsoft -- all located in the US, and all spied on by the NSA.  So new cloud service companies have grown in other countries, promising that they don't have any of their servers in the US, to attract clients worried about US government spying.</p>
