<h2> Daisy Design</h2>

<p>In this project you are going to use Snap! to create a geometric pattern called the “Daisy Design” and explore its variations.</p>

<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
            <li>Discuss how do you think this design was created.  What are the fundamental building blocks?  What kind of geometric transformations are employed?</li>
            <li>The entire design is made up of circles.  So the first thing to do is to write code that will create a circle. Create a custom block to do this, via the “Variables” menu “Make A Block” option.<br>
 <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Daisy_img/drawCircle.png" width="213"  alt=""/><br>
The sprite moves 1 step, turns 1 degree and repeats this 360 times to make a full cycle and draw a circle.  The <code>warp</code> block (from the Control blocks Menu) is there to make sure that the entire enclosed code is executed at once without a screen refresh.  In the absence of the <code>warp</code> block the circle will draw slowly step by step instead of all at once.
</li>
<li>
Now that you can draw a circle, generate the “Daisy Design” by rotating a bit at the end of each circle drawn.  In the design given there are 24 circles, which means we turn by 360/24= 15 degrees each time.<br>

Here is a custom block that will draw the “Daisy” pattern.<br>

</li>
<li>Now put it all together:<br>
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Daisy_img/GreenFlag.png" width="191"  alt=""/><br>
This code clears the screen of any previous drawings, sets the pen color, brings the pen to the center of the screen and draws the daisy.  The <code>hide</code> block hides the arrow sprite so only the drawing is seen.
</li>
 </ol>
            
  <div class="takeItFurther">
  <ol>
  <li>Extend your code so that you can create the following patterns.<br>

  <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Daisy_img/SixDaisy.png" width="240"  alt=""/>
  </li>
 <li>Consider the following variations on the pen color and thickness of the “Daisy Design”.  Study the codes and explore your own such variations.<br>
