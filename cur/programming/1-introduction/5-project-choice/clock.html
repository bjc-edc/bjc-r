<h2> Build Your Own Clock</h2>
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Clock_img/Clock.png" width="250"  alt=""/>
<body>
<p>In this project you are going to use Snap<em>!</em> to model and build a simple clock that displays the actual time.  You will write code that will make the second hand, minute hand and the hour hand of the clock to rotate properly and keep track of time.</p>

<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
            <li>Study the Snap<em>!</em> file linked here to get a feel for the type of simple clock we are building in this project.</li>
            


	<li>Discuss and discover the mathematics behind the mechanism of a clock.  How many degrees are there between each tick mark on the clock?  How many degrees must the second hand of the clock rotate every second as it moves between the tick marks?  How should the minute hand rotate every minute? How about the hour hand, every hour?</li>

<li>Study the Snap<em>!</em> student file linked here.  Notice that three sprites with costumes for the second, minute and hour hands of the clock have already been created for you.  There is also a sound file for “clock ticking” included with the second hand sprite.</li>

<div class="endnote">
You can use the Sensing Menu’s current time sensors to set up your clock to show the actual current time.   For example when the current time is <strong>10:45:20</strong> the following blocks will report:<br>
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Clock_img/currentHour.png"  height="45" alt=""/><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Clock_img/currentMin.png"  height="45" alt=""/><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Clock_img/currentSec.png"  height="45" alt=""/>
   
</div>
 <li>Try to model and build the clock on your own writing code for each sprite.  Look at the hints on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/5-project-choice/clock-hints.html" target="_blank">this page</a> only if you are really stuck.</li>

</ol>
</div>
<div class="takeItFurther">
  <ol>
  <li>Check the accuracy of the clock you have built.  For example, check it against the digital watch of a mobile phone.</li>
  <li>Does the clock you built show the hour hand moving continuously or jumping all at once at the end of every hour?  The hour hand shown below moves continuously and is pointing between 12 and 1 when  the time is <strong>12:26:36</strong>.  Can you adjust your code for the hour hand to implement this more realistic effect?<br>

  </li>
  <li>Design and build your own clock from scratch.  Find your own style and build a designer’s clock/watch putting different costumes together for the shape and the hands of the clock.  Note that you may want to use an image editing software such as Adobe Photoshop to edit and properly orient the images you will use.  Also make sure that the hands of the clock are anchored properly in Snap<em>!</em> by setting the rotation center at the appropriate location as shown below.<br>

</li>
<li>Create an alarm clock.  It should take some input from the user and then start beeping/ringing when the time is up.</li>
 <li>Build a “Grandfather Clock” that utilizes a swinging pendulum in its mechanism.  Or a “Cuckoo Clock” that has an animated bird that shows up at regular intervals. </li>
