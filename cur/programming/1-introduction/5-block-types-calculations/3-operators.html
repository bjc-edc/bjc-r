        <h2>Operators</h2>
        <p>
        	Math operations such as 
        	<img src="/bjc-r/img/python/plus.png" alt="_ + _"/>
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/minus.png" alt="_ - _"/>
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/axb.png" alt="_ * _"/>
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/divide.png" alt="_ / _"/>
            and
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mod.png" alt="_ mod _"/>
            are <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/5-block-types-calculations/1-commands-and-reporters.html">reporters</a>. Operations nested inside each other are just like parentheses in expressions in algebra:</p>
        <p class="center">
        	<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/5+(4x3).png" alt="5 + (4 &middot; 3)" title="5 + (4 &middot; 3)" /> = 5 + (4 &middot; 3) = 5 + 12
        </p>
        <p>The order of operations depends on how the blocks are embeded. Here, <span class="snap">snap</span> will first evaluate the innermost block, 4 &middot; 3, which equals 12, and then evaluate 5 + 12.  If you want to change the order of operations for an expression, rebuild the expression with the multiplication block on the outside.</p>

             		Determine what each of these scripts will report:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>

        <h3>The <code>Mod</code> Block</h3>
	
            <p>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mod.png" alt="() mod ()"/> block  <em>reports the remainder</em> when the first positive integer input is divided by the second. For example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/17-mod-5-reporting-2.png"  alt="17 mod 5 reports 2" title="17 mod 5 reports 2" /> because  when 17 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2. </p>
            <div class="sidenoteBig">In mathematics, we write <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/17-mod-5-reporting-2.png"  alt="17 mod 5 reports 2"> as 17&nbsp;(mod&nbsp;5)&nbsp;&#x2261&nbsp;2 and we write <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/15-mod-5-reporting-0.png" alt="15-mod-5-reporting-0"> as 15&nbsp;(mod&nbsp;5)&nbsp;&#x2261&nbsp;0.</div>
            <p>When one number divides another evenly, the remainder is 0: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/15-mod-5-reporting-0.png" alt="15 mod 5 reports 0" title="15 mod 5 reports 0" />.  So, the predicate <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/n mod 2 = 0, 138 × 23 pixels.png" alt="n mod 2 = 0"/> reports <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true" title="true" /> if <em>n</em> is divisible by 2 (so if <code><em>n</em></code> is even) and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false" title="false" /> if <code><em>n</em></code> is odd (not divisible with 2 and so the remainder is 1).</p>
