		<h2>Sprite Position and Direction</h2>
        <div class="todo">
        	<ol>
            	<li>Need to support students in learning geometry of angles and diagonals somewhere</li>
                <li>Paul, whatever you keep here, consider if they should be saving at the end. --MF</li>
                <li>Also, there was a GH comment suggesting that we "introduce the students to animation... This would be beneficial for their create task (ap exam final project)."</li>
                <li>MF: Consider including something like the python tutorial L, T, and checkmark problems...</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
		<p>This lab will summarize, clarify, and extend the ideas you have been studying in Unit 1.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
			<ol>
				<li>
					Change the stage's background to xy-grid  so that you see the coordinate plane grid and axes. The instructions and video below will remind you how.
					<ol type="a">
						<li>In the <a class="anchor" href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-introduction/2-sprites-having-conversation.html#window">Sprite Corral</a> (just below the screen), click the Stage button.</li>
						<div class="sidenote">There are also other backgrounds built into Snap<em>!</em> that you can use for other projects, or you can drag your own pictures in.</div>
                        <li>Then, choose "Backgrounds" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button"/> .</li>
                        <li>Choose "xy-grid.gif" to show the grid.</li>
					</ol>
					<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Change-Background-to-x-y-grid.gif" alt="video reminder of how to change stage background"></p>
				</li>
				<li>
                 	In the blue Motion palette, check the gray check-box next to the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/x-position.png" alt="x position" title="x position" />, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/y-position.png" alt="y position" title="y position" />, and <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/direction.png" alt="direction"> blocks. That creates &quot;watchers&quot; on the stage, boxes that show the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates of your sprite and the direction it is pointing.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/palette-checkbox.png" alt="X Position block's checkbox"/>&nbsp;
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/topic1/watcher.png" alt="X Position stage watcher"/>
				</li>
                <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" />
				<li>Drag the sprite around with your mouse. Also use <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> to control the sprite. Notice which actions change which values.</li>
				<li>Experiment to determine which <em>part</em> of the sprite the coordinates are describing. (Head? Tail? Center?)</li>
			</ol>

	        <p>Your stage should look like this with axes, a grid, the origin, and 3 watchers: <em>x</em> position, <em>y</em> position, and direction.</p>
            
		<div class="sidenote">
			<p>Some programming languages treat the top left corner of the screen as the origin: coordinates get bigger as you move <em>down</em> and right, with no negative coordinates. Snap<em>!</em> uses the same coordinates you use in algebra.</p>
        </div>
        
   	 	<p class="center"><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/snap-coord-grid.png" alt="Coordinate Grid"/></p>

        	<p>Snap<em>!</em> 's <em>coordinates</em> work the way you've learned in mathematics. <em>Direction</em> in Snap<em>!</em> works differently. Snap<em>!</em> uses 0 to mean "pointing North" (up) and 90 to mean "pointing East," (right) and so on. This is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_of_the_compass" title="Wikipedia compass directions" target="new"> compass directions</a> are expressed.</p>
            <p>(Mathematics uses a different convention: 0° for pointing in the positive direction along the <em>x</em>-axis, that is, toward the right, increasing as we turn counter-clockwise toward the north (90°) and beyond.)</p>
