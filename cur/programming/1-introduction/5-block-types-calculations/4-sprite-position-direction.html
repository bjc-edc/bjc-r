                    Change the stage's background to xy-grid  so that you see the coordinate plane grid and axes.  
                      <p>The video and instructions will remind you how.</p>

                        <li>In the <a class="anchor" href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-introduction/2-sprites-having-conversation.html#window">Sprite Corral</a> (just below the screen), click the Stage button.</li>
                        <li>Then, choose "Backgrounds" from the <span class="snap">snap</span> File menu, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button"/> .</li>
                        <li>Choose "xy-grid.gif" to show the grid.</li>

                 <li>
                            In the blue Motion palette, check the gray checkbox next to the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/x-position.png" alt="x position" title="x position" />, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/y-position.png" alt="y position" title="y position" />, and <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/direction.png" alt="direction"> blocks. That creates &quot;watchers&quot; on the stage, boxes that show the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates of your sprite and the direction it is pointing.

				<li>Drag the sprite around with your mouse. Also use <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> to control the sprite. Notice which actions change which values.</li>
              <li>Experiment to determine <em> part</em> of the sprite the coordinates are describing. (Head? Tail? Center?)</li>
            </ol>
</div>
	
	        <p>Your stage should look like this with axes, a grid, the origin, and 3 watchers: <em>x</em> position, <em>y</em> position, and direction.</p>
	<div class="sidenote">
        <p>Some programming languages treat the top left corner of the screen as the origin: coordinates get bigger as you move <em>down</em> and right, with no negative coordinates. <span class="snap">snap</span> uses the same coordinates you use in algebra.</p>
        </div>
   	 	<p class="center"><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/snap-coord-grid.png" alt="Coordinate Grid"/></p>
		
    	<div class="takeNote"><span class="snap">snap</span>'s <em>coordinates</em> work the way you've learned in mathematics. <strong>Direction</strong> in <span class="snap">snap</span> works differently. <span class="snap">snap</span> uses 0 to mean "pointing 'North'" and 90 to mean "pointing 'East,'" and so on. This is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_of_the_compass" title="Wikipedia compass directions" target="new"> compass directions</a> are expressed. Mathematics uses a different convention: 0° for pointing in the positive direction along the <em>x</em>-axis (that is, toward the right), increasing as we turn counter-clockwise toward the north (90°) and beyond.
