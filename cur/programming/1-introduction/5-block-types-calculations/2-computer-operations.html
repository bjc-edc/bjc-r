                            <div class="commentBig">I find pseudocode in Snap<em>!</em> blocks to be very disturbing. It disrupts my trust in the blocks to be what I'm learning them to be. I had to stop and read this image over and over again to parse it with a comment masked as a reporter. We see overwhelming reports of similar issues with the "tiny number of" script pic elsewhere in this unit. (I'll post new GH comments after U3 is done, but I've peeked and there are more about that one image.) I think we should have a design principle to <em>not</em> do this kind of Snap<em>!</em> pseudocode. I liked the regular pseudocode we had at some point, but not this. Let's talk about it. :) --MF </div>

                            <div class="endnote">There are many ways to write <code>which row?</code> and <code>which column?</code> You can, of course, use lots of <code>if</code> statements, but since the number of rows can change, it's hard to know how many to use. One convenient way is to divide the total size of the game board by the size of each cell. To use that result, you need to round down. <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/round-a-number.png" alt="round a number"> can do it, but it rounds to the <em>nearest</em> integer, up <em>or</em> down. The function <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/floor of number.png" alt="floor of number"> always rounds <em>down</em>, making it easier to use.
