		<h2>Gossip and Simple Sentences</h2>
        	<div class="takeNote">
   			  <p><strong>What you will do:</strong> In this lab, you will program your computer so that two sprites gossip with each other, generating the gossip randomly from words and ideas you specify. <br /> Keep it friendly!</p>
              <p><strong>What you will learn:</strong> You will learn to <em>create your own blocks</em> that you can use just like the blocks that Snap<em>!</em> provides. You will  learn how to <em>create lists of data</em>, <em>select data</em> from those lists, and <em>combine data</em> in new ways. In this project, the data will be words and phrases that you supply.</p>
              <p><strong>On your own:</strong> You can, if you like, give the sprites costumes you choose, or make them gossip only when you click on them. Later, you will use <code>gossip</code>-like programs in other projects.</p>
			</div>
             <div class="comment">Teacher note: edit the project, insert your name, three or four students' names, and some famous name the students all know; keep "my cat," and something else silly</div>

        <h3>Editing blocks in a working program</h3>
        You can improve this program by editing <code>who</code> and <code>does what</code> to give them more (or different) language.
		<div class="forYouToDo">
         	<ol start="11">
            	<li>Here's how to edit <code>who</code> to give it more names.<br />
                <strong>TO EDIT <em>ANY</em>&nbsp; BLOCK,</strong>
                  <ul>
           	      <li><strong>Control-click</strong> (or right-click) on that block and choose "edit..." <br />
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In <em>this</em> case, control-click on <code>who</code>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Make your changes</strong>.  <br />
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In <em>this</em> case, you'll find  instructions inside the block.</li>
                        <li><strong>Click OK</strong> when you're satisfied. (Or click "Cancel" if you don't want to make changes). </li>
                    </ul>	
				</li>
                <li>Now edit <code>does what</code>. Be creative and funny (but thoughtful)!</li>
                <li>Edit <code>who2</code> (in Sprite(2)'s script) to make it better.</li>
