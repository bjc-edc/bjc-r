		<h2>Making a Computer Gossip</h2>
        <div class="todo">
        	<p><strong>What you will do:</strong> In this lab, you will program your computer so that two sprites gossip with each other, picking randomly from words and ideas that you specify. Keep it friendly!</p>
            <p><strong>What you will learn:</strong> You will learn to <em>create your own blocks</em> that you can use just like the blocks that Snap<em>!</em> provides. You will  learn how to <em>create lists of data</em>, <em>select data</em> from those lists, and <em>combine data</em> in new ways. In this project, the data will be words and phrases that you supply.</p>

            <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will program two sprites to gossip with each other, each picking randomly from words and ideas that you specify. Keep it friendly!</p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will experiment with an existing program and edit custom blocks used by each sprite.</p>
