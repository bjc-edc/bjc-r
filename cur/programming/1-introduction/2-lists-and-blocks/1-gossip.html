		<h2>Gossip and Simple Sentences</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>What you will do:</strong> In this lab, you will program your computer so that two sprites gossip with each other, picking randomly from words and ideas that you specify. <br /> Keep it friendly!</p>
            <p><strong>What you will learn:</strong> You will learn to <em>create your own blocks</em> that you can use just like the blocks that Snap<em>!</em> provides. You will  learn how to <em>create lists of data</em>, <em>select data</em> from those lists, and <em>combine data</em> in new ways. In this project, the data will be words and phrases that you supply.</p>
            <p><strong>On your own:</strong> You can, if you like, give the sprites costumes you choose, or make them gossip only when you click on them. Later, you will use <code>gossip</code>-like programs in other projects.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="comment">Teacher note: edit the project, insert your name, three or four students' names, and some famous name the students all know; keep "my cat," and something else silly</div>
        
        <h3>Experimenting with a working program</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">  
            <ol>
            	<li><em>Make sure you're logged in</em>. Then <a href="/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/U1L2-gossip.xml" class="run">load this file</a>. Perform each experiment enough times to understand what each block does.</li>

            <ol start="2">
            	<li>In the <strong>sprite corral</strong>, not on the stage,
            click on the <strong>green sprite </strong>,  named sprite(2), to see the script that controls it. Again, perform each experiment enough times to understand each block's behaviors.</li>

        <h3>Editing blocks in a working program</h3>
        You can improve this program by editing <code>who</code> and <code>does what</code> to give them more (or different) language.
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="3">
                <li>Now go back to your first sprite. (Remember to click  in the sprite corral, not on the stage.)</li>
                <li>
                    Here's how to edit <code>who</code> to give it more names.<br />
                    <strong>TO EDIT <em>ANY</em>&nbsp; BLOCK,</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Control-click</strong> (or right-click) on that block and choose "edit..." <br />
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In  this case, control-click on <code>who</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Make your changes</strong>.  <br />
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In  this  case, you'll find  instructions inside the block.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Click OK</strong> when you're satisfied. (Or click "Cancel" if you don't want to make changes). </li>
                    </ul>	
                </li>
                <li>Now edit <code>does what</code>. Be creative and funny (but thoughtful)!</li>
                <li>Edit <code>who2</code> (in Sprite(2)'s script) to make it better.</li>
