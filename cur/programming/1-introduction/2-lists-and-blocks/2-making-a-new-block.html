		<h2>Improving Gossip by Making a New Block</h2>
		<div class="learn">
			<p> <strong>What you will do: </strong> <code>gossip2</code> always starts with  "Oh, but...." That can get boring. That starter-phrase could change, just the way the people and action change. </p>
			<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will improve <code>gossip2</code>. You will learn to <strong>build and name a completely new block</strong> that randomly chooses phrases like "Oh, but" or "Did you hear?" or &quot;Who cares!&quot; (or...), and you will learn how to use your new block to replace a part in an already existing block.</p>
		</div>
        
        <h3>Making a New Block</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">  
            <ol>
                <li> Open your saved project, U1L2-Gossip (if it's not already open).</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>TO MAKE A NEW BLOCK,</strong>
                    <ol style="a">
                        <div class="comment">Create video for this. We need the clarity of screencastOmatic's tracking of the mouse.</div>
                        <li><strong>Control-click</strong> (or right-click) on any empty spot on the scripting area, and choose "make a block..." </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Type a title for your block.</strong> <br /> 
                            &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; For  this   block, use the title <code>gossip starter</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Select a shape.</strong>  <br />
                            &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; For  this block, choose the oval <em>Reporter</em> shape. (You'll learn why later.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Click OK.</strong></li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Drag in the blocks you need and build the script.</strong> <br />
                            &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; For  this  block, you need <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/list.png" alt="the list block"> and  <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/item.png" alt="the item block">.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Assemble the blocks.</strong><br />
                            &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; In  this  case, the structure  will look just like  <code>who</code> or <code>does what</code>. 
                            <div class="sidenote">If you forget what's inside <code>who</code>, you can edit it and just leave the editor open for you to see as you work on your new block.  </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Fill any inputs</strong> that need to be filled.<br />
                            &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; For  this  project, click &quot;1&quot; in <code>item</code> and select <em>random</em> to get a random choice. <br /> 
                            &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; (In other projects, you will specify which item to use.) <br />
                            &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Then fill <code>list</code> with whatever you want.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Click OK</strong> when you're satisfied. </li>
                    </ol>	
                </li>
                <div class="endnote">Every block needs a <strong>title</strong>, a <strong>nature</strong> (shown by the block's shape), and a <strong>script</strong> that defines its behavior. It also needs a place to "live" (a <strong>palette</strong>, shown by the color). You can choose any palette/color that makes sense to you, or leave it gray. For now, these gray "Other" blocks live in the "Variables" palette.</div>
                <li>Click on your new <code>gossip starter</code> block several times to check it. It should work just like the <code>who</code> and <code>does what</code> blocks.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Using Your New Block</h3>
        <p>It's a good idea to save often.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="4">
            	<li>Now edit <code>gossip2</code> and slide your new <code>gossip starter</code> block in, to replace the text "Oh, but...."</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>Checking and debugging</h3>
        <p>
            Whenever you program, give your programs a workout, testing to see if they do what you want. <br />
            Generally, you should first test <em>parts</em> that you've just built or changed. <br />
            Then, if the <em>parts</em> work, test the <em>whole</em> program.
        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="5">
                <li>Check it out! Click <code>gossip2</code> a few times to see if you like how it works. Fix whatever still needs work.</li>
                <li>Now switch back to the gray sprite and click on its script to check the whole program. </li>
                <div class="saveAs"><span class="text">"U1L2-Gossip"</span><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-this-as.png" alt="Save your work as U1L2-Gossip" title="Save your work as U1L2-Gossip" /></div>
