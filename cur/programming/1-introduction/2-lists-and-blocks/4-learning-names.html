		<h2>Learning a New Name</h2>
        <h2>Project:  Meet and Greet</h2>
        	<p>Imagine a <em>greeter</em> at the door of a restaurant. The greeter asks each new guest, "what's your name?"   If Mario comes in and the greeter   recognizes the name, she says "Nice to see you again, Mario."  If the greeter doesn't recognize the name, she says, "Nice to meet you, Mario," and  remembers Mario's name for next time. The goal of this project is to build a script that acts like the greeter.</p>
            	<h3>Getting Started</h3>

      <p>There are two parts that will make this work:
       	<ol>
          <li>Create a list to store the names of people the greeter knows. </li>
          <img src="../../../../img/1-introduction/knownpeople.png"  alt="known people">
            
            
            
          <li>Create a script that gives the right greeting to each customer. First, the greeter asks the guest for his or her name.  Then the greeter has to make a decision:  is the guest in the list of  <code>people I know</code>  or not?
          <ol>  
          	<li><strong>if</strong> <code>people I know</code> contains the guest's name, <code>say</code> "nice to see you again, <em>guest name</em>."  </li>
            <li><strong>esle</strong> <code> say</code> "nice meet you, <em>guest name</em>," and add the guest's name to the list of known people. </li>
          </ol>
               
          </li>
            <p>The decision making block is made with <code>if-else</code>

          <p>The workspace below has most of the pieces you need to make the script.  Your job is to snap the peices together to get the project working correctly.</p>
