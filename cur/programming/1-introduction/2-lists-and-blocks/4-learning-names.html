		<h2>Learning a New Name</h2>
        <h2>Project:  Meet and Greet</h2>
        	<p>Imagine a <em>greeter</em> at the door of a restaurant. The greeter asks each new guest, "what's your name?"   If Mario comes in and the greeter   recognizes the name, she says "Nice to see you again, Mario."  If the greeter doesn't recognize the name, she says, "Nice to meet you, Mario," and  remembers Mario's for next time. The goal of this project is to build a script that acts like the greeter.</p>
