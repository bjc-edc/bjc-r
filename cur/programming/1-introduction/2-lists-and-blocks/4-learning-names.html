		<h2>Learning a New Name</h2>
        <h2>Project:  Meet and Greet</h2>
        	<p>Imagine a <em>greeter</em> at the door of a restaurant. The greeter asks each new guest, "what's your name?"   If Mario comes in and the greeter   recognizes the name, she says "Nice to see you again, Mario."  If the greeter doesn't recognize the name, she says, "Nice to meet you, Mario" and  remembers Mario's name for next time. The goal of this project is to build a script that acts like the greeter.</p>
            	<h3>Getting Started</h3>
          
	
	<div class="forYouToDo" id="first"> 
      <p>There are two parts that will make this work:
       	<ol>
          <li>Create a list to store the names of people the greeter knows. <div class="sidenote"><code>people I know</code> starts out as an empty list.  The script will add names to it as new guests arrive.  </div>   </li>
          <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/knownpeople.png"  alt="known people">
            
            
            
          <li>Create a script that gives the right greeting to each customer. First, the greeter asks the guest for his or her name.  Then the greeter has to make a decision:  is the guest in the list of  <code>people I know</code>  or not?
          <ol>  
          	<li><strong>if</strong> <code>people I know</code> contains the guest's name, <code>say</code> "nice to see you again, <em>guest name</em>."  </li>
            <li><strong>else</strong> <code> say</code> "nice meet you, <em>guest name</em>," and add the guest's name to the list of known people. </li>
          </ol>
               
          </li>
            <p>The decision making block is made with <code>if-else</code>

          <p>If you <a href="/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/meet-and-greet-template.xml" class="run">load this file</a>, you'll get  most of the pieces<div class="sidenote">Make sure the script works the way you want it to.</div> you need to make the script.  Your job is to snap the peices together to get the project working correctly.  <div class="comment">AC:  I miss my iframes.</div></p>
          
       
        <li>Stop the script (click the red stop-sign button). Then start the script again. Does it still remember you?</li>
        <li>Click the <code> SET</code> block. Then run the greeting script again. Explain what the <code> SET</code> block did.</li>
       
    </ol>
</div>
        
  
  <div class="takeItFurther">  
  <p>Add some enhancements to your script.  For example, </p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>If the guest is new, have the greeter ask ``Do you have any pets?'' and store the answer along with the guest's name. <div class="sidenote">Each entry to <code>people I know</code> can be a list of <em>name</em> and <em>kind of pet</em> for each guest. </div></li>
        <li>If the guest is known to the greeter and has a pet, have the greeter say "How's your <em>dog, cat, bird, ...</em>? getting the kind of pet from the <code>people I know</code> list.</li>
    
    </ol>
</div>
