        <h2>Polygonal Racetracks</h2>
        
        <div class="learn">
            <strong>In this project,</strong> you are going to explore the turning angles needed to trace or draw regular polygons.<br>

<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/PolygonalRacetracks_img/PolygonalRacetracks.gif" width="300" alt="Pentagonal Racetrack" title="Pentagonal Racetrack"/>

        </div>
        <div class="sidenote">A <em>regular</em> polygon is a geometric figure in which all the sides and angles are equal.</div>

<p>Imagine that you have a racecar that needs to travel on a racetrack in the shape of a regular polygon.  Every time the car reaches a corner, it needs to make a turn in order to stay on track.  But, how much is this turn? And exactly how does it depend on the number of sides of the polygon?</p>


<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li> Use this <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/5b-polygonal-racetracks-interactive1.html" title="Polygonal Racetracks Interactive 1" target="_blank">interactive program</a> to see demonstrations of how the racecar would travel in such a track.</li>
</ol>
</div>
Notice in the movie below that (unlike what intuition might say) the turning is done not inside but outside of the polygon.<br>

<p>Now you will discover what the turning angle must be for each of the polygons below:</p>
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/PolygonalRacetracks_img/3.png"  height="120" alt="Triangle with turning angles" title="Triangle with turning angles"/>
<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/PolygonalRacetracks_img/4.png"  height="120" alt="Square with turning angles" title="Square with turning angles"/>
<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/PolygonalRacetracks_img/5.png"  height="120" alt="Pentagon with turning angles" title="Pentagon with turning angles"/>
<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/PolygonalRacetracks_img/6.png"  height="120" alt="Hexagon with turning angles" title="Hexagon with turning angles"/>

<p>An easy way to do this is to notice that if you start from a corner and keep traveling along the polygon making a turn at each corner until you come back to where you started, you have made a full cycle of 360&deg;.  A bird’s-eye view of the tracks shown on the right, from high enough up that the racetrack looks like a single dot, might make this clearer.</p>

</div>
                              
<p>Thus, the <strong><em>sum</em></strong> of all the turning angles must be 360&deg;.  </p>

<li>What does this imply for <strong><em>each</em></strong> turning angle of<br>
<ul> 
<li>An equilateral triangle?</li>
 
<li>A square?</li>
 
<li>A regular pentagon?</li>
 
<li>A regular hexagon?</li>
 
<li>A regular polygon with N sides?</li>

</li>

<li>Now you know everything you need to create custom made Polygon block that will take the number of sides and side length as input and will draw the desired regular polygon.
Fill in all the blanks below.  Build and test your code.<br>
