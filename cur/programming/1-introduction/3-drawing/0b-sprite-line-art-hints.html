<p>Here is a possible initialization code:</p>
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/EtchASketch_img/Initialize.png" width="215" alt=""/>
<p>Here is a way to give functionality to the space bar:</p>
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/EtchASketch_img/clear.png" width="246"  alt=""/>
<p>Here are two ways to give functionality to the right arrow key.  Note that the second option prevents the sprite moving outside the stage dimensions (x between -240 to 240 and y between -180 to 180.)</p>
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/EtchASketch_img/Right.png" width="276"  alt=""/>
<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/EtchASketch_img/Restricted_Right.png" width="276" alt=""/><br>
<p>Now write the code to give functionality to up, down, left arrow keys on your own.</p>
