		<h2>Modify Your Pinwheel</h2>
		<div class="learn">
        	<strong>On this page,</strong> you will modify your existing <code>pinwheel</code> block so that you can use it to draw a variety of shapes.<br />

        <h3>Multiple Inputs</h3>
        <p>Recall how you first <em>generalized</em> your original pinwheel script: you added an input variable called <var>branches</var> that controlled the turning angle of the sprite. By adding <em>more</em> input variables, you can generalize other aspects of your program...</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">

				<li>If it isn't already open, open your U1L3-Angles project.</li>
                <li>
                    Experiment with the input for the <em>second</em> <code>move</code> block inside your <code>pinwheel</code> block as shown below.
                    <ol>
                    	<li>

                        	First predict. What do you think will happen?
                        </li>
                        <li>Then try several inputs between -100 and 0.</li>

                            What happened? How does it compare to what you predicted? How does this input value impact the sprite's behavior? How does it impact the resulting image on the stage?

                	Add a <em>second</em> input variable to control the amount of "backing up" that the sprite does before each turn through the full 360&deg;.
                	<ol>
                        <li>Then, go to the Settings menu (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/settings_button.png" alt="Settings menu icon" title="Settings menu icon" />), and make sure that "Plain prototype labels" are <em>un-checked</em>.</li>
                        <li>Now, edit your <code>pinwheel</code> block, click the "+" sign at the <em>end</em> to add another input to this procedure, and call the new variable <var>backup</var>.</li>
                        <li>Drag in the <var>backup</var> variable, and place it where it belongs in the <code>pinwheel</code> code.</li>
                        <li>Check that the new input slot in the <code>pinwheel</code >block behaves like the changes in your experimentation above.</li>

				<li>The goal is use abstraction to hide details by using a general-purpose tool in specialized ways.</li>
				<li>The’ve just created a general-purpose block (pinwheel) that can be used inside other blocks to create special-purpose blocks to do a particular job. Like
                <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/" alt="" title="" /><br />
                of
                <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/" alt="" title="" /><br />
                This habit of designing a general-purpose machine and that can be used in many different
special-purpose ways is an extremely useful practice in all kinds of fields, and we should celebrate
it with the kids. “Hiding complexity. . . .”</li>
				<li>They use what they have learned to create designs: flags, abstract designs, and triangles with<br>
				  children (leading to recursivly blocks).</li>
