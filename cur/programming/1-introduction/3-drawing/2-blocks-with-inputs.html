		<h2>Blocks with Inputs</h2>
        <div class="takeNote">
    		  <p><strong>What you will do:</strong> Turn the scripts you have built into a single block, with an input, that draws squares, triangles, and circles. You will give it a second input to control the size. You'll make a variation that draws stars. On the next page, you'll combine these to do flags or artwork.</p>

              <p><strong>What you will learn:</strong> Abstraction—giving blocks <em>inputs</em> to let them do a wider variety of jobs.</p>

    A 360° turn is a full turn. Half of that (180°) was a half turn.  A fourth of that <img src="../../../../img/1-introduction/360-divided-by-4-with-result-90.png" alt="360-divided-by-4-with-result-90"> was a quarter turn. You don't have to do the division yourself. Snap<em>!</em> can compute  for you. You can use <img src="../../../../img/1-introduction/turn-360-divided-by-7-degrees.png" alt="turn-360-divided-by-7-degrees"> or <img src="../../../../img/1-introduction/turn-360-divided-by-3-degrees.png" alt="width=&quot;219&quot; height=&quot;34&quot; "> to get a seventh of a turn or a third of a turn.

    A <strong>script</strong> is a sequence of instructions that tells a computer what to do. A <strong>program</strong> is a set of scripts. In some programming languages, like <span class="snap">snap</span>, you program by dragging blocks (individual instructions) and snapping them together. In other languages, you <em>type</em> the instructions. The idea is the same.
