            <div class="ap-standard">AAP-2.A.1, AAP-2.A.2, AAP-2.A.3</div>
            <p>An <strong>algorithm</strong> is a sequence of steps that are usually performed by a computer. The algorithm doesn't have to be written in any particular programming language or even in a programming language at all; you can write your algorithm in English or any other human language. Some people call an algorithm written in human language <strong>pseudocode</strong>. Once you know the steps that the computer will take, you can code your algorithm in the programming language of your choice.</p>
            <div class="endnote">What's the purpose of "pseudocode"? Why write an algorithm vaguely in English when you could write it precisely in Snap<em>!</em>? If you were programming in a punctuation-heavy language, designing your program in pseudocode would help you focus on the important ideas instead of on details like quotation marks and semicolons. But pseudocode isn't as necessary with a language like Snap<em>!</em>, and pseudocode can make it easy for you to fall into wishful thinking about what the computer is capable of (such as writing "Pick tomorrow's winning lottery numbers" or "Here's the melody; write the harmony").</div>

                    <p>Snap<em>!</em> has a tool called <strong>Visible Stepping</strong> that allows you to control how quickly Snap<em>!</em> steps through the blocks of your code. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Click the Visible Stepping button (<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/visible-stepping.png" alt="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" title="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" />), and adjust the slider to control the stepping speed. When you run your code, the sprite will slowly execute each step of the code and highlight it in <span style="color: black; background-color:cyan">cyan</span>.
                            <div class="endnote">

                            You can slow the stepping to do only one step at a time and wait until you tell Snap<em>!</em> to go on to the next one. Move the slider all the way to the left, and then you can press the Run/Pause button (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/play-pause-button.png" alt="pause button with play/pause icon" title="pause button with play/pause icon" />) to  see what happens at each step of your code.

                    In the Pen menu you'll find the <code>set pen to crayon</code> block.  Computers can display billions of colors, but unless you have to match the paint on your wall very precisely, finding your way through all those colors may be more trouble than it's worth.  The crayon library, just like a box of crayons, gives you a small set of vibrant colors, arranged in families.  So if you want a lot of browns in your picture, you could pick a random number between 30 and 39.<br />

                    At the right is a painting by Theo van Doesburg.  It has some things in common with the Malevich picture, mainly the use of rectangles as the design elements.  But there are no 45-degree rectangles; instead, the constraint is that rectangles may not overlap, so if you want to place a random rectangle in the picture, each end may have to be shortened to avoid collisions.  You can use <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/blackp.png" alt="((brightness) at (myself)) = 0" title="((brightness) at (myself)) = 0" /> to find out if the point behind the sprite's rotation center is black.
