        <div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Algorithm</strong>
            <p>An <strong>algorithm</strong> is a sequence of steps that are usually performed by a computer. In some programming languages, like Snap<em>!</em>, you program algorithms by dragging blocks (individual instructions) and snapping them together. In other languages, you <em>type</em> the instructions. The idea is the same.</p>
            <p>An algorithm <em>isn't</em> a computer program (it isn't the code) but rather a <em>general description of the steps</em> the computer should follow. The algorithm isn't specific to a particular programming language; once you know the steps that the computer will take (that is, once you have your algorithm), you can write the code in the language of your choice. </p>
