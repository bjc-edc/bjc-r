            <p>PG: We imply a promise we only sort-of keep. I'd mostly keep this page, but change the pink box. I'd also bring back the Albers algorithm (currently optional project page 5) somewhere. That one doesn't even require angle and gives a rich variety of solid-color shapes—rectangles, triangles, circles, hot-dogs—as well as opportunities for varying color. USE, MODIFY, be creative. </p>
            <p>BH: I would eliminate all the WAIT blocks throughout.  I'm saying KEEP if that's the only problem.</p>

		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Algorithm</strong> and <strong>Pseudocode</strong>
            <p>An <strong>algorithm</strong> is a sequence of steps that are usually performed by a computer. The algorithm doesn't have to be written in any particular programming language or even in a programming language at all; you can write your algorithm in English or any other human language. Some people call an algorithm written in human language <strong>pseudocode</strong>. Once you know the steps that the computer will take, you can code your algorithm in the programming language of your choice.</p>
