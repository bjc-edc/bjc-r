        <div class="learn"><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn how keeping a programming journal can help your programming.</div>

        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/write-in-journal.png" alt="Write In Your Journal" title="Write In Your Journal" />
		Every day in your journal, keep notes like the following:
		<ul>
			<li>Any concept about programming that you had trouble understanding.</li>
			<li>Questions that you want to remember to ask.</li>
			<li>Ideas for projects that you want to work on or improvements to an existing project that you want to make.</li>
			<li>
				Problems with your code:
				<ul>
					<li>What was the symptom?</li>
					<li>What did the cause turn out to be?</li>
					<li>What change did you make to fix the problem?</li>
					<li>What techniques did you use to investigate the problem?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				How did you organize your code?
				<ul>
					<li>Did you define new procedures?
						<ul>
							<li>Do they take inputs? If so, what type of inputs do they require? (That is, what is their <em>domain</em>?)</li>
							<li>Do they take report a value? If so, what type of value do they report? (That is, what is their <em>range</em>?)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Could you have defined a procedure somewhere instead of copying and pasting code?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>When appropriate, you might want to include pictures of the stage or of important scripts in your code.</li>
		</ul>

	<p><div class="sidenoteBig">You don't need to copy things out of the curriculum into your journal; you can always look those up in the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/summaries/vocab-index.html?course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="curriculum index">index</a>.</div><strong>The journal is for you, not for your teacher.</strong> You won't be graded on what you do or don't put in it.  The journal isn't graded because it's a record of the things only you experience in the class, not a record of the ideas in the curriculum.   Everyone's journal will be different.</p>
