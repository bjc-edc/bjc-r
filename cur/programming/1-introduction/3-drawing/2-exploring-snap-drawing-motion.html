        <h2>Angles and Turning</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p>
                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn about sprite turning angles, which are needed for drawing polygons. For starters, you'll  draw various asterisks, like these: <br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Three-spikes.png" height="68" alt="three-spikes" title="three-spikes" />
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Five-spikes.png" height="82" alt="five-spikes" title="five-spikes" />
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Eight-spikes.png" height="89" alt="eight spikes" title="eight spikes" />
            </p> 
        </div>

	<p>On the previous page, when you were trying to draw an equilateral triangle, did you try this code:
	<br /><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/half-hex-code.png">
	and get this picture?
	<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/half-hex-pic.png"><br />
	If so, it's probably because of a geometry lesson in which you were taught that the angles in an equilateral triangle are all 60 degrees.</p>

	<p>You've probably worked out by experiment that the turning angle has to be 120 degrees, but you may not yet understand why, not well enough to be able to draw a five-sided or eleven-sided polygon.  This is an important thing to understand, so this page and the next will be devoted to it.</p>

        <div class="takeNote">A 360° turn is a full turn. Half of that (180°) is a half turn.

		<p>At the beginning of this page, you knew that to make a triangle you need 120° turns, but maybe you weren't sure why.  Now you know why a <em>three-spoke asterisk</em> takes 120° turns, but what does that have to do with triangles?</p>

        	<ol start="6"> 
                <li>Try different input values for the <code>move</code> <var>-100</var> <code>steps</code> block (first -90, then -50, then -10), and do some of the turning experiments (above) with each value. Does this change the values needed for the <code>repeat</code> or <code>turn</code> blocks?  These pictures are called "pinwheels."</li>

				<li>Find the <code>pinwheel, ( ) spokes</code> block, and try a three-spoke pinwheel with it.  Are the colored angles the same as for the three-spoke asterisk?</li>
