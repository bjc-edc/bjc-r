        <h2>Angles and Turning</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p>
                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn about sprite turning angles, which are needed for drawing polygons. For starters, you'll  draw various asterisks, like these: <br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Three-spikes.png" height="68" alt="three-spikes" title="three-spikes" />
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Five-spikes.png" height="82" alt="five-spikes" title="five-spikes" />
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Eight-spikes.png" height="89" alt="eight spikes" title="eight spikes" />
            </p> 
        </div>

        <p>
            When you were trying to draw an equilateral triangle on the previous page, you might have tried code like this:<br />
            <div class="comment">Brian, these images need alt/title text. --MF, 9/1/19</div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/half-hex-code.png" alt="" title="" />
            and seen a result like this:
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/half-hex-pic.png" alt="" title="" /><br />
            It's common to try this if you've learned that the angles in an equilateral triangle are all 60 degrees. However, the angle that the <em>sprite</em> needs to turn to make a triangle is actually 120 degrees, and it's important to understand why that is and how to find the correct angle for other polygons (five-sided, eleven-sided, etc.).
        </p>

                        <li>Then, try the experiment.</li>

		<p>At the beginning of this page, you knew that to make a triangle you need 120° turns, but maybe you weren't sure why.  Now you know why a <em>three-spoke asterisk</em> takes 120° turns, but what does that have to do with triangles?</p>

                <li>Try different negative input values for the <code>move</code> <var>-100</var> <code>steps</code> block (first -90, then -50, then -10), and do some of the turning experiments (above) with each value.

					    <strong>It's your art.  Take liberties.</strong>
						<p>I tried to think of a way to begin by laying out streets and then positioning brown houses beside them.  But I couldn't figure out how.  Then I thought, Thomas's picture is more brown than white.  What if I start with a solid brown background and then lay down white roads?</p>
						<p>The way to get a solid color background is to tell the stage to use that color:
						<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/tell-stage.png"><br />
						(It's a little strange because the stage doesn't <em>have</em> a pen, but it interprets that command to mean that it should color the entire background that color.)</p>
						<p>Then it's just a matter of plotting some meandering white roads, by turning a smallish random number of degrees after each move.</p>
						<p>Thomas's original map has what looks like the center of town, with the town hall and so on, at the right edge of the picture.  Having failed at a faithful reproduction of the obvious map-ness of her work, I wanted to get some of the details similar, so when one of my meandering roads started near the right end of the stage, I used a thicker white pen to paint it.</p>
						<p>But don't follow my plan any more rigidly than you would hers.  Do whatever appeals to you.</p>

					But then Snap<i>!</i> 5.0 came out, and it has a map feature:<br />
					<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/map.png"><br />
					(Load the "World Map" library in Snap<i>!</i> to use this.)  The library even has different modes of presentation of the map data, one of which is "Watercolor":<br />
					<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/water.png"><br />
					With this as a starting point, I was able to go over the map point by point and adjust the colors:<br />
