        <h2>Angles and Turning</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p>
                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn about sprite turning angles, which are needed for drawing polygons. For starters, you'll  draw various asterisks, like these: <br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Three-spokes.png" alt="asterisk with three spokes" title="three spokes" />
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Five-spokes.png" alt="asterisk with five spokes" title="asterisk with five spokes" />
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Eight-spokes.png" alt="asterisk with eight spokes" title="asterisk with eight spokes" />
            </p> 
        </div>

        <p>
            When you were trying to draw an equilateral triangle on the previous page, you might have tried code like this:<br />
            <div class="comment">Brian, these images need alt/title text. --MF, 9/1/19</div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/half-hex-code.png" alt="" title="" />
            and seen a result like this:
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/half-hex-pic.png" alt="" title="" /><br />
            It's common to try this if you've learned that the angles in an equilateral triangle are all 60 degrees. However, the angle that the <em>sprite</em> needs to turn to make a triangle is actually 120 degrees, and it's important to understand why that is and how to find the correct angle for other polygons (five-sided, eleven-sided, etc.).
        </p>

                            Experiment with a <em>quarter</em> turn (<code>turn</code> 90 degrees instead of 180). Adjust the number of repetitions (the number you give to <code>repeat</code>) until you get the sprite to finish facing the same way it started.<br />

                        <li><em>Without trying it on the computer,</em> figure out what turning angle to use for a five-spoke asterisk.  Make sure your partner agrees.</li>
                        <li>Then, try the experiment.</li>
                    </ol>

		<p>At the beginning of this page, you knew that to make a triangle you need 120° turns, but maybe you weren't sure why.  Now you know why a <em>three-spoke asterisk</em> takes 120° turns, but what does that have to do with triangles?</p>
