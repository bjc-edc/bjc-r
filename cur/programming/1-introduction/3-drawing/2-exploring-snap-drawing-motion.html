			<p><strong>On this page:</strong>  These art works are by Josef Albers, Vassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg, and Kazimir Malevich. The styles are very different, but all of them are based on <em>polygons</em> or <em>circles.</em> First, you'll learn how to draw the various polygons: </p>
