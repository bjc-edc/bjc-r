                    Play Note Bug?? We've gotten several messages about this, but I have not been able to recreate this error on my machine, so I think the file is fine. I have however seen the bug on NYC school computers (shown below). I have reported this on <a href="https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks/issues/985" target="_blank">the Snap<em>!</em> repo</a>. --MF<br /><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/bugs/play-note-ctx-error.JPG" height="200" alt="" title="" />

        	You have already used three ways to repeat a set of actions.
        	<ol>
				<li>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png" alt="the forever block" title="the forever block" /> block tells the computer to repeat the same action <em>forever</em>.</li>
                <li>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="the repeat block" title="the repeat block" /> block lets you repeat an action <em>a specific number of times</em>.</li>
				<li>The <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat-until.png"  alt="repeat until"> block lets you repeat an action <em>until some special condition occurs</em>.</li>
            </ol>
            On this page, you will learn a fourth useful way.
        	<ol start="4">
				<li>The <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/for.png" class="imageCenter" alt="for"> block lets you name a variable (here, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png" alt="i" title="i" />) that says which repetition you are on. You can use the variable in the script you are repeating. </li>

        	The <code>for</code> block lets you simplify long scripts like:<br /> 
            <div class="sideHOMbig">Each time the <code>for</code> block  runs your script, it changes the value of the variable <!--<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png" alt="i" title="i" />-->by 1, counting from the first input number to the second. You can <em>use</em> that variable in your script.<!-- The animation shows how. If you like, you can also change the name of that variable by clicking on it. --></div>
