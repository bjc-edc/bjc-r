        <h3>Adding Multiple Inputs</h3>
        <p>Recall how you first <em>generalized</em> your original pinwheel script: you added an input called <var>number of branches</var> that controlled the turning angle of the sprite. By adding <em>more</em> inputs, you can generalize other aspects of your program.</p>

                            What happened? How does it compare to what you predicted? How does this input value impact the sprite's behavior? How does it impact the resulting image on the stage? What number input number gives an asterisk? What input number gives a polygon?<br />

                    <p>From Dan's work at San Mateo: U1.3.4.5 I really like how pinwheel is the generic block but you then ask them to make specific versions of "polygon" and "asterisk" based on inputs to pinwheel. Out of 15 groups, I probably saw 6 of them who, when asked to show their pinwheel block, had not "connected" all three inputs to their code below. That is, they hadn't dragged the input variables down, so the pinwheel was only responding to "number of turns". So there's something wrong there in that the task asks them to add "size" but nothing asks them to test it. <s>These kids also didn't connect "backup" so that means they must have skipped U1.3.4.7.</s> --MF, 9/5/17</p>
                    <p>Brian, I believe I have addressed this with the endnotes on problem 4 and problem 6. Please have a look (carefully reading the alt text and making sure that I've not confused myself characterizing the differences). If you agree that this resolves Dan's concerns, you can remove this red box. Thanks! --MF, 1/4/21</p>

            <p>
                One way to avoid having bugs in your program in the first place is to keep your code organized by deleting any unused scripts.  You can use the <strong>clean up</strong> option by right-clicking (or control-clicking on a Mac) in the scripting area to organize your blocks.  You can <strong>remove a block or script</strong> either by dragging it out of the scripting area and back to the palettes on the left or by choosing the "delete" option from the drop-down menu. <a href="#hint-organizing" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click here for a video of cleaning up the scripting area and removing blocks.">Click here for a video</a>. (Note that this is different from the "delete block definition" option which will permanently delete a custom block and all its instances from your entire project.)<br />

The four pictures above were inspired by it, but the sizes and placement of the circles in the original were carefully chosen, whereas the ones above are random.  Also, Kandinsky's solid circles aren't quite uniform in color.  For example, the green circle near the top right of the picture has a light green outer border, a somewhat darker green inside, a blue-green inner border, and black inside that.
				<div class="narrowpurple">When two solid circles overlap, you can see both colors, or rather, a color in between the two.  To achieve that effect in Snap<em>!</em>, before drawing the second circle, use the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/set-transparency.png" alt="" title="" /> block.  A transparency of 0 means you see only the new color; a transparency of 100 means you see only the old color.  In-between values determine which color is stronger in the overlapping area.

				Most of Kandinsky's circles are solid, but a few aren't. most notably the large white "halo" near the middle of the painting.  His hollow circles don't have a constant width; if you want yours to look like his, change the pen size a little as you're drawing.  But of course you don't have to make your art look exactly like his, nor exactly like the examples above.  Use them for inspiration, but you're the artist.

                    Make a picture that looks more like a real pinwheel:<br />

                    <p>It doesn't have to look exactly like the photo.  But each arm of a pinwheel is essentially two triangles.  You may find the <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/fill.png" alt="fill block" title="fill block" /> block helpful.</p>
