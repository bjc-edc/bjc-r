		<h2>Modify Your Pinwheel</h2>
		<div class="learn">
        	<strong>On this page,</strong> you will modify your existing <code>pinwheel</code> block so that you can use it to draw a variety of shapes.<br />

        <h3>Adding Multiple Inputs</h3>
        <p>Recall how you first <em>generalized</em> your original pinwheel script: you added an input variable called <var>branches</var> that controlled the turning angle of the sprite. By adding <em>more</em> input variables, you can generalize other aspects of your program...</p>

                    Experiment with the input for the <em>second</em> <code>move</code> block inside your <code>pinwheel</code> block as shown below.<br />

                            What happened? How does it compare to what you predicted? How does this input value impact the sprite's behavior? How does it impact the resulting image on the stage?

						<!--<li>First, go to the Settings menu (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/settings_button.png" alt="Settings menu icon" title="Settings menu icon" />), and make sure that "Plain prototype labels" are <em>un-checked</em>.
