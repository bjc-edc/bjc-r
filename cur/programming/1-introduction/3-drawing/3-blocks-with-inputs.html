        2.2.1 Develop an abstraction when writing a program or creating other computational artifacts. [P2]<br />
        2.2.1A The process of developing an abstraction involves removing detail and generalizing functionality.<br />
        2.2.1B An abstraction extracts common features from specific examples in order to generalize concepts. <br />
        2.2.1C An abstraction generalizes functionality with input parameters that allow software reuse.<br />
        5.3.1D Procedures have names and may have parameters and return values.<br />
        5.4.1G Examples of intended behavior on specific inputs help people understand what a program is supposed to do. <br />

		<p>The scripts are essentially all the same; only the <em>input values</em> change. Instead of having many separate scripts, you can make one more general script that will draw all such designs. Your <code>pinwheel</code> block will need an input to specify how many branches you want, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pinwheel-block.png" height="40" alt="pinwheel, branches:()" title="pinwheel, branches:()"> just as the <code>go to</code> block has inputs to specify x and y values <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/go-to-empty-inputs.png" height="40" alt="go to x:() y:()" title="go to x:() y:()">.</p>

            <h4><strong>Debugging Tip: Commenting Your Code</strong></h4>
            <div class="todo">
                <p>I made some edits to this text, including removing the word "organization" from "increasing the overall clarity and <em>organization</em>" because it's not clear to me how documentation helps with organization (I mean, it might <em>inspire</em> better organization, but it doesn't do that directly). --MF, 3/20/18</p>
                <p>Regarding the placement of this content on the page, could it go just before FTYD #2 so they have a chance to use comments on the page? Then we could add something to the FYTD #2 encouraging them to comment this code. I want this to be integrated with their work rather than a standalone idea. --MF, 3/20/18</p>
                <p>In the animation, can you please type out the comments rather than pasting them in? You don't have to include every frame of the typing, but the paste-in looks mysterious. Also, can you make the animation linger on the first and last frame by changing the display time for those frames? Actually, it would be nice to linger on the frame where you open up the <code>pinwheel</code> context menu and hover over "help" too so that it's clear how one would get there; that goes by too quickly. --MF, 3/20/18</p>
            </div>
            <p>Adding comments to your code helps you remember what your code does, helps other people reading your code to understand it, and can help you avoid bugs by increasing the clarity of your program.  This animation shows how to add comments to your Snap<em>!</em> code by right-clicking (or control-clicking the stage and choosing "add comment."</p>
            <p>Notice that a comment attached to the hat block in the block editor becomes the help message for a custom block.</p>
