        <p>The scripts are essentially all the same; only some of the <em>input values</em> change. Instead of having many separate scripts, you can make one general block <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pinwheel-block.png" height="40" alt="pinwheel, branches:()" title="pinwheel, branches:()"> that will draw <em>all</em> such designs.

                        <p>But the hat block comment in the movie isn't very good documentation.  It should say "Draws a REGULAR five-sided polygon, with SIDE LENGTH set by the input."  (Not really capitalized; I just did that to emphasize to you what's missing.)</p>

                        Adding comments to your code may help you remember what your code does, helps other people reading your code to understand it, and can help you avoid bugs by increasing the clarity of your program.  But it won't do any of those things if you comment every line of code, so each comment just says how a block inside your script works.

					<p>Part of the reason some people emphasize the importance of detailed comments is that they are programming in text languages, which discourage long variable and procedure names.  (Typically, you can't include spaces in the names, and you have to type the entire name every time you use that variable or procedure.)  So you see names like <code>substLcUc</code> instead of <code>substitute lower case letters for capital letters in string</code>.  If a program is full of drastically abbreviated names for procedures and variables, it's no surprise if the code needs documentation.  In Snap<em>!,</em> the names in the program can be self-documenting.</p>

		<h3>More About Program Documentation</h3>

		<div class="comment">CRD-2.G.1, CRD-2.G.5</div>
		<p>Commenting is only one form of documentation.  It's not the <em>best</em> form, because attaching a comment to a particular place in the program documents only that one procedure or code segment, and doesn't explain how different sections of the program interact.  But commenting is an easy way to document small details.</p>
		<p>Documentation can be <em>external</em> (written for users of the program) or <em>internal</em> (written for yourself or other developers of the program).  Both kinds are important, if it's a program people other than the author are going to use.  Usually they should be separate documents&mdash;another reason why comments aren't the best form of documentation.</p>
		<div class="comment">CRD-2.G.4</div>
		<p>If you're writing a program by yourself, internal documentation may seem silly.  "I know how my own program works."  But if the program will still be in use a year later, it will probably need maintenance, and you may well have forgotten the details of its implementation.  In a programming class like this one, most of the programs you write are very small, and you can understand them at a glance.  But real programs are generally much bigger than lab exercises designed to take less than an hour of work.</p>
		<div class="comment">CRD-2.G.3</div>
		<p>It's best if the first attempt at documentation is made even before starting to code.  The documentation will specify the desired program behavior (external) and the intended program structure (internal).  These documents can be used in testing the code to ensure that it behaves as planned.</p>
