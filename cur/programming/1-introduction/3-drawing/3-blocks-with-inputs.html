		<p>The scripts are essentially all the same; only the <em>input values</em> change. Instead of having many separate scripts, you can make one more general script that will draw all such designs. Your <code>pinwheel</code> block will need an input to specify how many branches you want, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pinwheel-block.png" height="40" alt="pinwheel, branches:()" title="pinwheel, branches:()"> just as the <code>go to</code> block has inputs to specify x and y values <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/go-to-empty-inputs.png" height="40" alt="go to x:() y:()" title="go to x:() y:()">.</p>

                <h4><em><strong>Brian</strong></em> will fix the video to address his concerns:</h4>
                <p>Oh, about the orange box on 1.3.3, I think the comment on the hat block is okay, but the comment on the turn is exactly the sort of thing I wouldn't do.  In fact I might make a point of saying that when you're /teaching/ someone, you (we) put in comments that you wouldn't use if you were just programming for yourself.</p>
                <p>But the hat block comment in the movie isn't very good documentation.  It should say "Draws a REGULAR five-sided polygon, with SIDE LENGTH set by the input."  (Not really capitalized; I just did that to emphasize to you what's missing.)</p>
                <p>Really it's hard to give an example of useful commenting that doesn't look stupid unless you have a big project.  Then, for example, when some global variable is used without being set, you might want to attach a comment "FOO is set in procedure BAR that's called in the initialization."</p>
            </div>
		
            <p>Adding comments to your code helps you remember what your code does, helps other people reading your code to understand it, and can help you avoid bugs by increasing the clarity of your program.  This animation shows how to add comments to your Snap<em>!</em> code by right-clicking (or control-clicking) in the Scripts area and choosing "add comment."</p>
            <p>Notice that a comment attached to the hat block in the Block Editor becomes the help message for a custom block.</p>
