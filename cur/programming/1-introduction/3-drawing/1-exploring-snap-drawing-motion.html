		<h2>Drawing and Motion</h2>
        <div class="learn">
    		  <p><strong>What you will do:</strong>  Create blocks that let you draw circles, stars, and polygons and explore art and graphic design.</p>

              <p><strong>What you will learn:</strong> <em>loops to repeat processes</em>, using Snap<em>!</em> to <em>automate calculations</em>, giving blocks <em>inputs</em> to let them do a wider variety of jobs, <em>reporting and setting locations on the stage</em> and <em>controlling sprite movement and direction</em>, and using and controlling <em>color and other pen attributes</em>.</p>
              <p><strong>Possible projects this lab will prepare you for:</strong> You might draw  national flags, model the work of artists like Josef Albers,Vassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian,Theo van Doesburg, or Kazimir Malevich, or create new art in your own style.</p>

    A 360° turn is a full turn. Half of that (180°) was a half turn.  A fourth of that <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/360-divided-by-4-with-result-90.png" alt="360-divided-by-4-with-result-90"> was a quarter turn. You don't have to do the division yourself. Snap<em>!</em> can compute  for you. You can use <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/turn-360-divided-by-7-degrees.png" alt="turn-360-divided-by-7-degrees"> or <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/turn-360-divided-by-3-degrees.png" alt="width=&quot;219&quot; height=&quot;34&quot; "> to get a seventh of a turn or a third of a turn.

    A <strong>script</strong> is a sequence of instructions that tells a computer what to do. A <strong>program</strong> is a set of scripts. In some programming languages, like <span class="snap">snap</span>, you program by dragging blocks (individual instructions) and snapping them together. In other languages, you <em>type</em> the instructions. The idea is the same.</div>
