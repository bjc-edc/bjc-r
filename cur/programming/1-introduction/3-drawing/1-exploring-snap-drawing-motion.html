		<p> A <strong>script</strong> is a sequence of instructions that tells a computer what to do. A <strong>program</strong> is a set of scripts. In some programming languages, like <span class="snap">snap</span>, you program by dragging blocks (individual instructions) and snapping them together. In other languages, you <em>type</em> the instructions. The idea is the same.		</p>

    A 360° turn is a full turn. Half of that (180°) was a half turn.  A fourth of that <img src="../../../../img/1-introduction/360-divided-by-4-with-result-90.png" alt="360-divided-by-4-with-result-90"> was a quarter turn. You don't have to do the division yourself. Snap<em>!</em> can compute  for you. You can use <img src="../../../../img/1-introduction/turn-360-divided-by-7-degrees.png" alt="turn-360-divided-by-7-degrees"> or <img src="../../../../img/1-introduction/turn-360-divided-by-3-degrees.png" alt="width=&quot;219&quot; height=&quot;34&quot; "> to get a seventh of a turn or a third of a turn.
