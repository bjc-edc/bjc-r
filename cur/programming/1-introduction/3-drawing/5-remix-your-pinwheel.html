                <li>I don’t get the title “remix your pinwheel”.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>I'm not sure what the problem is. Can you elaborate and/or suggest an alternative? They are changing their previous work on the pinwheel, so they are "remixing" it. --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>
                <li>The grey box is much more than vocabulary—it’s really important.</li>
                <ul><li>I agree that it's really important, but I don't think that means it can't be in a vocab box. We shouldn't write vocab boxes that we don't think are important. I'd leave this as is. --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>
                <li>Delete # 4. Sometimes extraneous stuff is needed to ensure generality. And <strong>Polygonal Racetrack</strong> isn’t live, is it?</li>
                <ul><li>I like it, but I'd be ok for it to be an ITIT problem. I'm not sure what is meant by your Polygonal Racetrack comment, but I do want to hear from Brian and/or Paul about whether that page really addresses the matter and isn't just superfluous. --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>
                <li># 5: What does the “size” of a circle mean? Maybe this can go.</li>
                <ul><li>I'd expect this was left vague so they can decide what they are taking as input (I recall that taking radius makes for a not-straightforward calculation. I'm not against cutting the problem though--maybe that's the thing to do... --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>
                <li>Delete the TiF. It seems only remotely connected to the ideas on the page.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>I'm ok with this on the principle that we can't just keep things because we like them. They have to fit into the story of the course. --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>

            <p>Using a block you've already written to help write another block is an example of <strong>abstraction</strong>. Abstraction is arguably the most important idea in computer science, but it doesn't have a simple definition. Here, abstraction means using a more general block (<code>pinwheel</code>) to create two more specific blocks (<code>asterisk</code> and <code>polygon</code>). There are other kinds of abstraction too, and we'll point them out as they come up.</p>
            <div class="comment">AAP-3.B.5</div>
            <p>In the meantime, if you find yourself wanting to copy code from one place to another, consider <em>abstracting</em> by writing a general block to use in both places instead. This makes your code easier to write and to read.</p>
