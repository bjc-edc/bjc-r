            <ul>
                <li>The gray box is much more than vocabulary—it’s really important.</li>
                <ul><li>I agree that it's really important, but I don't think that means it can't be in a vocab box. We shouldn't write vocab boxes that we don't think are important. I'd leave this as is. --MF, 5/16/18</li><li>BH, any reason not to delete this comment? --MF, 5/14/19</li><li style="color: orange">All the other abstraction-related boxes are orange. -bh</li><li>That is not true. See 1.2.2, as a quick example. --MF, 9/2/19</li><li>You're right!  We should be consistent.  I vote orange, but we can talk about it later. -bh</li></ul>
                <li>Delete # 4. Sometimes extraneous stuff is needed to ensure generality. And <strong>Polygonal Racetrack</strong> isn’t live, is it?</li>
                <ul><li>I like it, but I'd be ok for it to be an ITIT problem. I'm not sure what is meant by your Polygonal Racetrack comment, but I do want to hear from Brian and/or Paul about whether that page really addresses the matter and isn't just superfluous. --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>
                <li># 5: What does the “size” of a circle mean? Maybe this can go.</li>
                <ul><li>I'd expect this was left vague so they can decide what they are taking as input (I recall that taking radius makes for a not-straightforward calculation. I'm not against cutting the problem though--maybe that's the thing to do... --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>

            <p>Teacher feedback from 2017-2018: one teacher: "On page 5 the picture of the asterisk does not look like what their output should be, it should be all one color and all equally spaced. This really confused all students. On page 7 the rectangle block. My students were able to do this but most of them did not use loops here. This would be a great opportunity for them to get a better understand of the importance of loops and see if we can challenge them to write a loop or have them trace a rectangle on paper and see how many times they repeat. This is what I did with my students. Students had a lot of problems understanding parameters I did a mini lesson on this. This might be something we might want to go into more examples and explanations of. The quick blurb about the definition did not get them the understanding they needed." --MF, 3/6/19</p>

            <p>Here is another kind of <em>abstraction</em>: noticing that <code>asterisk</code> and <code>polygon</code> are both kinds of pinwheels, and writing one, more general, <code>pinwheel</code> block that uses an input so that the block can be used to make asterisks, polygons, or other interesting designs.</p>
            <div class="comment">AAP-3.B.5</div>            
            <p>This is an example of <strong>abstraction by generalization</strong>: looking at chunks of code that are <em>almost the same</em> and writing a single block by <em>using an input</em> to distinguish among the different cases.</p>

                <li>If you look inside of <code>pinwheel</code> and see how you're using it in <code>polygon</code>, you'll see that there are steps that you don't really need for the case of a polygon.

                    As long as your <code>polygon</code> block draws the right picture, it doesn't matter to the rest of the project what's inside it.
