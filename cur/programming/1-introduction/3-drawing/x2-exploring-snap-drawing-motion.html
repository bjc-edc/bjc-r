						<p>I tried to think of a way to begin by laying out streets and then positioning brown houses beside them.  But I couldn't figure out how.  Then I thought, Thomas's picture is more brown than white.  What if I start with a solid brown background and then lay down white roads?</p>
						<p>The way to get a solid color background is to tell the stage to use that color:
						<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/tell-stage.png"><br />
						(It's a little strange because the stage doesn't <em>have</em> a pen, but it interprets that command to mean that it should color the entire background that color.)</p>
						<p>Then it's just a matter of plotting some meandering white roads, by turning a smallish random number of degrees after each move.</p>
						<p>Thomas's original map has what looks like the center of town, with the town hall and so on, at the right edge of the picture.  Having failed at a faithful reproduction of the obvious map-ness of her work, I wanted to get some of the details similar, so when one of my meandering roads started near the right end of the stage, I used a thicker white pen to paint it.</p>
						<p>But don't follow my plan any more rigidly than you would hers.  Do whatever appeals to you.</p>

					But then Snap<i>!</i> 5.0 came out, and it has a map feature:<br />
					<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/map.png"><br />
					(Load the "World Map" library in Snap<i>!</i> to use this.)  The library even has different modes of presentation of the map data, one of which is "Watercolor":<br />
					<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/water.png"><br />
					With this as a starting point, I was able to go over the map point by point and adjust the colors:<br />
