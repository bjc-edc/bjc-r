            <p>PG: We imply a promise we only sort-of keep. I'd mostly keep this page, but change the pink box. I'd also bring back the Albers algorithm (currently optional project page 5) somewhere. That one doesn't even require angle and gives a rich variety of solid-color shapes—rectangles, triangles, circles, hot-dogs—as well as opportunities for varying color. USE, MODIFY, be creative. </p>
            <p>BH: I would eliminate all the WAIT blocks throughout.  I'm saying KEEP if that's the only problem.</p>

        <pre>p.1  Square.  Art: several squares one inside another but not concentric.

2.  Draw an equilateral triangle.  Discuss w/ another pair.  WRITE DOWN everything you try.

Here's a way to think about turning angles: Asterisks.  What's the turning angle for a 3-way asterisk?

Art: snowflake art.

3.  Connection between asterisk angle and polygon angle: Invent pinwheel.
Abstraction: generalize a pattern.

Art: Albers.  (Thick pen.)

4. More generalization. Circles/Kandinsky

5. Name poly/aster as specific cases of pinwheel.

6. FOR.  Albers again?  Squiral.

            <p>An <strong>algorithm</strong> is a finite sequence of steps that are usually performed by a computer. The algorithm doesn't have to be written in any particular programming language or even in a programming language at all; you can write your algorithm in English or any other human language or using a diagram. Some people call an algorithm written in human language <strong>pseudocode</strong>. Once you know the steps that the computer will take, you can code your algorithm in the programming language of your choice.</p>
            <div class="endnote">
                Pseudocode can make wishful thinking too easy. You can write <em>anything</em> as a line of pseudocode: "Pick the winning lottery numbers" or "Modify Facebook to make 1,000 people like my post." Pseudocode only works if you have a clear understanding of what the computer can really do. And the only way to be sure of that is to code in the language you will be using. Pseudocode for a Snap<em>!</em> program will look different from pseudocode for a Java program.</div>

                    <p>Snap<em>!</em> has a tool called <strong>Visible Stepping</strong> that allows you to control how quickly Snap<em>!</em> steps through the blocks of your code. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Click the Visible Stepping button (<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/visible-stepping.png" alt="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" title="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" />), and adjust the slider to control the stepping speed. The sprite slowly executes each step of the code while it is highlighted in <span style="color: black; background-color:cyan">cyan</span>.

                            You can slow the stepping to one just step at a time. Move the slider to the slowest setting (all the way to the left), and the shape of the yellow Run/Pause button will change (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/play-pause-button.png" alt="pause button with play/pause icon" title="pause button with play/pause icon" />). Now, you can press Run/Pause button to <em>single step</em> through your code and see what happens at each step.

        <p>One way visible stepping is useful is to help you read someone else's code, by watching it unfold at human speed instead of computer speed. That's what you're doing here. Visible stepping is also useful in fixing problems with (debugging) your own code when it's doing something wrong and it's hard to see what.</p>
