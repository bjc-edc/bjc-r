                <li>This could turn into a project of the kind Brian talks about. Just give them the bones and turn them loose. It’s about bringing together what they know, not about learning new ideas.</li>
                <ul><li>I agree. This page feels overdone. I'd drop #1 and #2 (or put them in yellow if we really need them), keep the orange, drop #3, move #4 up to the top as #1 (but drop the second sentence), drop #5, keep TIF A, drop TIF B, keep something like TIF C but don't give the answer just the idea, drop D, and merge E with C but trim it down. --MF, 5/16/18</li></ul>

            <p>PG: I, too, agree with Al.  Almost no new content here, but new ideas for using that content. Suggest some new ideas and let the kids go.  Remember to include Albers algorithm first.</p>
            <p>BH: I really don't like the manual filling of regions here.  Either we program it or we do something different.</p>
            <p>MF: consider making OP per comments OR at least more open ended</p>

                    If you have not done so already, build a block to draw a regular polygon of a given number of sides and a given side length.<br />

                    <p>You can use <code>say for</code> to get information about the state of your program while it's running. This animation shows how to use <code>say for</code> to understand the problem in buggy code for drawing a rectangle. Notice how this makes the program pause and give you information to help you identify the source of error.</p>

                    In the scripting area, set out a collection of the tools and blocks that may be handy in creating your art work.  You can adjust the input values for these blocks as needed as you create your art.  This video shows how to create some overlapping regions and then fill some of them with color.<br />

                    Below are some other ideas that use randomness, color and other artistic elements. Create your own art that incorporates randomness in some way.<br />

                        Here is one way you can add randomness to your art: <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/GraphicArt_img/randomArtCode.png" height="75" alt="polygon, sides:(pick random (3) to (12)) side length:(pick random (10) to (50))" title="polygon, sides:(pick random (3) to (12)) side length:(pick random (10) to (50))"/>
