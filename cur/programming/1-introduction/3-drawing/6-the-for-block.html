                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will use <code>for</code> loops not only to repeat, but also to count the repetitions and then use that counter to draw shapes with repeated patterns:<br />

        	You've seen these ways to repeat a set of commands:
                <div class="sidenoteBig">The <code>forever</code> block generates an <em>infinite loop</em> that goes on forever.  An infinite loop can sometimes be the result of a bug, but in some interactive programs, you <em>want</em> the program to keep running until stopped by the user.</div>

				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png" alt="the forever block" title="the forever block" />  repeats the same commands <em>forever</em>.

        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Iteration</strong>
            <div class="ap-standard">AAP-2.J.1</div>
            <p>Computer scientists describe a repeating program structure as <em>looping</em>, <em>repetition</em>, or <strong>iteration</strong>.</p>
            <div class="ap-standard">AAP-2.K.1</div>
            <p>
                The code can be repeated <code>forever</code>, a specific number of times (such as when using <code>repeat</code>), or until something specific happens (such as when using <code>repeat until</code> as you'll see in Lab 5). <br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/repeat-4(move-100-turn-right-90).png" alt="repeat (4) (move (100), turn clockwise (90))" title="repeat (4) (move (100), turn clockwise (90))" />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-tiny-no-hat.png" alt="repeat until (touching (Leader)?)
{
    point towards (Leader)
    move (1) steps
}" title="repeat until (touching (Leader)?)
{
    point towards (Leader)

}" />
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Sometimes the script inside a loop needs to know which time through the loop it's in (first, second, etc.).
            You can use <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/for.png" class="imageCenter" alt="for(i)=(1) to (10){}" title="for(i)=(1) to (10){}" /> to keep track, and you can use its counter (the default name is <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png" alt="i" title="i" />) in the repeated script. For example, the <code>for</code> block lets you simplify long scripts like: <br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/for-loop-equivalent.png" alt="say (1) for (2) secs, say (2) for (2) secs, say (3) for (2) secs... say (10) for (2) secs" title="say (1) for (2) secs, say (2) for (2) secs, say (3) for (2) secs... say (10) for (2) secs" />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to
            <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/for-loop-drag-i.gif" height= 180 alt="for (i)= (1) to (10) {say (i) for (2) secs}" title="for (i)= (1) to (10) {say (i) for (2) secs}" />
		</p>
        <p>Each time the <code>for</code> block  runs the script inside, it changes the value of the counter by 1, beginning with the first input number and ending after the second.</p>

        <div class="takeNote">The <code>for</code> block's default counter name, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png" alt="i" title="i" /> stands for "index." You can change this name by clicking it. To use the counter, drag it into the script.</div>

                        <strong>Randomness:</strong> The four examples above are
                        different from the actual Albers picture in that they include
                        occasional colors that aren't from the same family.  This can
                        make the pictures more interesting to someone who doesn't
                        share Albers's interest in subtle differences in color.  (Albers himself, in fact, had more color variation in other pictures of this type.)
                        <em>Too much</em> randomness, though, can make the picture
                        <em>less</em> interesting.  Compare the last two examples
                        above; the left one of those two is clearly based on the orange family, with rainbow-neighbors red and yellow, but

                        times, or once out of 14 times.  Other random choices you can
                        make are the number of squares, how much to shrink the size
                        from one square to the next, and how much to move the corner of
                        the next square horizontally and vertically (the picture is more
                        interesting if those two numbers are different, so the smallest
                        square isn't exactly in the center).
