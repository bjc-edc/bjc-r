                <strong>On this page,</strong> you will use <code>for</code> loops to repeat <em>and count the repetitions</em> so you can use that counter to draw shapes with repeated patterns:<br />

            <div class="comment">AAP-2.J.1</div>
            <p>Computer scientists describe a repeating program structure as <em>looping</em>, <em>repetition</em>, or <strong>iteration</strong>.</p>
            <div class="comment">AAP-2.K.1</div>
            <p>
                The code can be repeated <code>forever</code>, a specific number of times (such as when using <code>repeat</code>), or until something specific happens (such as when using <code>repeat until</code> as you'll see in Lab 5). <br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/repeat-4(move-100-turn-right-90).png" alt="repeat (4) (move (100), turn clockwise (90))" title="repeat (4) (move (100), turn clockwise (90))" />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-tiny-no-hat.png" alt="repeat until (touching (Leader)?)

    point towards (Leader)

    point towards (Leader)

        </div>

        <p>
            Sometimes the script inside a loop needs to know which time through the loop it's in (first, second, etc.).
            You can use <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/for.png" class="imageCenter" alt="for(i)=(1) to (10){}" title="for(i)=(1) to (10){}" /> to keep track, and you can use its counter (the default name is <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png" alt="i" title="i" />) in the repeated script. For example, the <code>for</code> block lets you simplify long scripts like: <br /> 
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/for-loop-equivalent.png" alt="say (1) for (2) secs, say (2) for (2) secs, say (3) for (2) secs... say (10) for (2) secs" title="say (1) for (2) secs, say (2) for (2) secs, say (3) for (2) secs... say (10) for (2) secs" />  
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to  
            <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/for-loop-drag-i.gif" alt="for (i)= (1) to (10) {say (i) for (2) secs}" title="for (i)= (1) to (10) {say (i) for (2) secs}" /> 
		</p>
        <p>Each time the <code>for</code> block  runs the script inside, it changes the value of the counter by 1, beginning with the first input number and ending after the second.</p>   
    
        <div class="takeNote">The <code>for</code> block's default counter name, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png" alt="i" title="i" /> stands for "index." You can change this name by clicking it. To use the counter, drag it into the script.</div>

				<strong>Randomness:</strong> The four examples above are

				share Albers's interest in subtle differences in color.  (Albers himself, in fact, had more color variation in other pictures of this type.) 
				<em>Too much</em> randomness, though, can make the picture
				<em>less</em> interesting.  Compare the last two examples

				from one square to the next, and how much to move the corner of
				the next square horizontally and vertically (the picture is more
				interesting if those two numbers are different, so the smallest
