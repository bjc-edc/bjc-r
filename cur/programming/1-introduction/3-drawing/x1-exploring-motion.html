				<li>At the right is a painting by Kazimir Malevich.  Its elements are rectangles, either horizontal or at a 45-degree angle, plus or minus a few degrees.  You can position rectangles randomly.  Don't feel that your picture has to look exactly like his!
					<div class="narrowpurple">
					    <strong>Filled rectangles.</strong>  Make and run this script:<br />
			            <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/flat.png"><br />
						The light blue <code>set</code> block is in the Sensing palette, where it looks like <code>set video capture to</code>.  Just click once in the hexagonal slot to get True (the green check box).  If you're not sure what difference the "flat line ends" makes, try clicking the hexagonal slot again to run the script with that option False.  And of course you can change all the numbers, or have your program pick random numbers.
					</div>
					I thought the thick horizontal almost-black bar in Malevich's original added a lot to the power of the piece, so in my program I made sure to have one of those.  Also, I wanted a few tiny squares, and to make sure they weren't overlayed with thick bars I made the thick ones first and the dots last.  But, again, your taste may be completely different.  You don't even <em>have</em> to use <code>flat line ends</code>:<br />
