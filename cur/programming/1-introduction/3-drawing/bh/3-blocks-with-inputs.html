                Teacher feedback from 2017-2018: 
                <ul>
                    <li>there were specific components that were challenging for students. A handful of teachers expressed the desire for more examples or variations, especially in relation to loops, including having students write their own loop, as well as the relationship between script variables and values of code. A few teachers mentioned that either their students had trouble with the directions or weren’t reading the text carefully enough. Specific areas of struggle included loops, blocks with inputs, designing three inputs, always dragging an input inside each new custom block, feeling comfortable being creative and making mistakes, and building interest in creating scripts and utility scripts. </li>
                    <li>one teacher: "Page 3 Blocks with Inputs was especially challenging for the kids. They had a hard time understanding the relationship between the script variables and the values the user passed as parameters to the code. Perhaps before launching into this page where they have to understand the repeats and angle relationships, create some VERY basic examples. That being said, the kids LOVED making colorful designs. They were very proud of their creations. They spent a great deal of time exploring angle relationships and the images that were created. Page 6: The for loop needs more attention. There should be a number of examples showing how this works before students are asked to use it. The one say examle was not enough to make them comfortable. They did enjoy making the spiral and squiral."</li>

		<p>The scripts are essentially all the same; only some of the <em>input values</em> change.

			<h4>Abstraction by generalizing a pattern</h4>
			<p>You've seen several kinds of abstraction.  For example, any time you make a block, you are using the abstraction of <em>giving something a name.</em>  What you're doing on this page is a much more powerful kind of abstraction: finding a pattern (such as the similarities among the five pinwheel scripts in the first problem above) and <em>generalizing</em> it by <em>using an input</em> to represent the <em>differences</em> among the scripts.</p>
			<p>Whenever you're tempted to copy and paste a chunk of code, that's a big hint that you should instead create a block that contains the copied script.  Then you can replace each copy with a single block.</p>

                    <li>
                        A <strong>parameter</strong> (or <em>formal parameter</em>) is the input <em>name,</em> such as <var>number of branches</var>. The input name is set in the block definition. It never changes.<br />

                    <li>
                        An <strong>argument</strong> (or <em>actual argument</em>) is the input <em>value,</em> such as 6 for a hexagonal pinwheel. The input value is given each time the block is run; it can be a different value each time.<br />

                        <p>Oh, about the orange box on 1.3.3, I think the comment on the hat block is okay, but the comment on the turn is exactly the sort of thing I wouldn't do.  In fact I might make a point of saying that when you're /teaching/ someone, you (we) put in comments that you wouldn't use if you were just programming for yourself.</p>
                        <p>But the hat block comment in the movie isn't very good documentation.  It should say "Draws a REGULAR five-sided polygon, with SIDE LENGTH set by the input."  (Not really capitalized; I just did that to emphasize to you what's missing.)</p>
                        <p>Really it's hard to give an example of useful commenting that doesn't look stupid unless you have a big project.  Then, for example, when some global variable is used without being set, you might want to attach a comment "FOO is set in procedure BAR that's called in the initialization."</p>

                        Adding comments to your code may help you remember what your code does, helps other people reading your code to understand it, and can help you avoid bugs by increasing the clarity of your program.  But it won't do any of those things if you comment every line of code, so each comment just says how a block inside your script works.  You can add comments to your Snap<em>!</em> code by right-clicking (or control-clicking) in the Scripts area and choosing "add comment." <a href="#hint-comments" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an animation that shows how to add comments.">Click for an animation that shows how.</a>
