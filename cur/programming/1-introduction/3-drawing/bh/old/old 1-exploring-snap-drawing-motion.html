		<h2>Drawing and Motion</h2>
        <div class="todo">From Observation Notes Analysis: U2L1 (now seemingly moved here): "One of the boys at Innovation mentioned that there was an error in Snap’s arithmetic because Snap seems to think that triangles have 360° when we all know that they have only 180°.  I didn’t mention exterior angles, but did sketch a map of a road with a second one meeting it at a "sharp" angle. On the map, the angle is small, but what we experience when we bike and turn the sharp angle onto that road is a very large turn. On the polygon, only the interior angle is visible and the program deals only with the exterior angle.  We should probably have an image of a map—brief, no fancy language, maybe not even the terminology (because that’ll become a focus and take away from the understanding—in the curriculum with just the kind of informal comment the boy and I discussed. On the map both angles are visible: one is the tiny angle we tend to see; the other is the enormous angle we experience as we move."</div>

		<p> A <strong>script</strong> is a sequence of instructions that tells a computer what to do. A <strong>program</strong> is a set of scripts. In some programming languages, like <span class="snap">snap</span>, you program by dragging blocks (individual instructions) and snapping them together. In other languages, you <em>type</em> the instructions. The idea is the same.</p>
<p>For now, you're using blocks that <span class="snap">snap</span> provides. Soon, you'll invent and create your own blocks.</p>
