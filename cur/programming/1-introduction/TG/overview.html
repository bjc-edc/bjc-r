    	<h3 id="purpose" class="anchor">Purpose</h3>
    		<div>Students dive right into using <span class="snap">snap</span> by exploring its features and creating visual projects using important programming ideas such as loops, randomness, and building blocks. As much as possible, students should be encouraged to experiment with <span class="snap">snap</span>, playing with input parameters, using blocks before they have been formally introduced, and modifying and extending the assigned tasks. Creativity is not only a Big Idea of AP CS Principles, but also essential to students' experience of the course. In Unit 1, students will also discuss social implications of computing, including issues such as cyberbullying, the prevalence of social media, and the ethics of illegally downloading music. Students are likely to be familiar with these issues, and grappling with them at the beginning of the course helps students understand the relevance and necessity of understanding the world of computing.

    	<h3 id="compThinking" class="anchor">Highlighting Computational Thinking</h3>
        	<div><div class="sidenote">AP CS Principles identifies six Computational Thinking Practices:<!--<ul style="list-style-type:none"><li>P1: Connecting Computing</li><li>P2: Creating Computational Artifacts</li><li>P3: Abstracting</li><li>P4: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts</li><li>P5: Communicating</li><li>P6: Collaborating</li></ul>--><br><strong>P1</strong> Connecting Computing<br><strong>P2</strong> Creating Computational Artifacts<br><strong>P3</strong> Abstracting<br><strong>P4</strong> Analyzing Problems and Artifacts<br><strong>P5</strong> Communicating<br><strong>P6</strong> Collaborating</div></div>
            
            <div>One way students develop their computational thinking skills is through direct experience with <span class="snap">snap</span>. For example, students are frequently asked to predict what they think will result from a given <span class="snap">snap</span> script. Making such predictions requires students to make sense of the sequential nature of the code. Students are introduced to the idea of abstraction, and will experience this way of thinking as they learn what details they can manipulate or safely overlook in a script as they explore it, and as they are introduced to functions as a way to generalize processes. The emphasis on Pair Programming in Unit 1 is meant to help students communicate and collaborate in problem solving. Finally, students engage with the broader world of computing in exploring topics related to its impacts. As students write about and debate important social issues, they develop the thinking skills required to analyze complex issues.

    	<div class="sidenote"><div>The unit overview also suggests around 2 homework assignments per week. Depending on your class, it might make sense to give more or less homework. Many of the Opener or Research activities can be used for homework assignments as well.</div></div>
        <div><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/TG/lesson-list.html">Lesson List</a></div>
        <div>In the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H8cMxfDI_G4UWvISzv11G9hmQOiJivUvRk3d0tD2YPY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">unit overview</a>, one lesson is approximately 45 minutes. To get a sense of what a class period might look like for different lengths of time, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DYPzo2OS-tf0c_O2W23JCjETnh21Lp8pE8YIx_hjFmw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">click here</a>. Class time generally falls into one of five categories, plus homework:
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/TG/openers.html"><strong>Opener</strong></a>, a 5-minute activity to start the class.</li>
            <li><strong>Research</strong>, 10-15 minutes in which students learn about a topic by reading an article or looking up information online</li>
            <li><strong>Sharing Student Work</strong>, a 10-15 minute class discussion in which students see the posted work of others to talk about different problem-solving approaches and common pitfalls, or just to showcase students' creativity</li>
            <li><strong>Discussion</strong>, a 25-30 minute activity in which students might have a discussion or debate about a Social Implication or Big Idea of Computing</li>
            <li><strong>Lab</strong>, 25-40 minutes during which students generally work in pairs through online lab materials on the <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/1-intro-loops.topic">student pages</a></li>
            <li><strong>Homework</strong></li>
