        <h3>Computing in the News</h3>
            <div>This is the opener for Lessons 1, 2, 6, 10, 16, and 20. In general, teachers should find appropriate news articles to share with the class. Choose a mix of news stories, some which show the promise of technology and others which expose negative aspects. Some news sources and example news stories are given below.</div>

        <h3>Snap Judgment</h3>
        	<div>
            <dl>
            <dt>Lesson 4: What is cyberbullying?</dt>
            <dd>Students have likely heard of or even experienced some form of cyberbullying. In Blown to Bits, they will later read a story (page 16) about a student who committed suicide after hurtful comments were aimed at her online. While students generally agree that such tragedies should not occur, they likely differ about their definition of what should be considered cyberbullying. Later, they will engage in a class discussion about possible ways to address cyberbullying. This Snap Judgment is meant to help students clarify for themselves what they mean when they think of "cyberbullying."</dd>
            <dt>Lesson 13: Is technology good or bad?</dt>
            <dd>Technology is not all good or all bad. In this Snap Judgment assignment, look for ways that students use evidence to support claims they make about positive advancements or negative implications of technology. This is not meant to be a polished piece of writing, but should result in students thinking of examples to support their position. In class, they will read pages 13-17 of Blown to Bits which addresses both sides. [Also include link to BDL]</dd>
            <dt>Lesson 17: Do you think everyone who illegally downloads music or movies deserves to be prosecuted?</dt>
            <dd>Students have likely encountered this issue directly in their lives. In this Snap Judgment assignment, students begin to form an argument to support a position. Later in the class, students will receive more information about the issue and engage in a short debate.</dd>
            <dt>Lesson 19: Should violent video games be sold to minors?</dt>
            <dd>This question is the subject of an article that students will read today in class. Students again must construct an argument to support a position. Emphasize the importance of providing reasons and considering counterarguments that might be made by the other side.</dd>
