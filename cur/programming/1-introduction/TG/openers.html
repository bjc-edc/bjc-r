    <div>There are four kinds of Openers:
    <ul>
    	<li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/TG/openers/computing-in-the-news.html"><strong>Computing in the News</strong></a><br>  Students are presented with and discuss a current news story about computing. Students gain a greater sense of the relevance of computing in society, are exposed to complex social issues, and learn to read news stories with an informed and critial eye.</li>
        <li><strong>Make a Prediction:</strong> Students predict the result of a piece of code. Students reason through the logic of code. Teachers might use these to introduce a new concept or address a common misconception.</li>
        <li><strong>Aww, Snap!:</strong> Students are presented with code containing an error and must debug it. Students gain experience with debugging and must make sense of code. Teachers might use these to point to a common pitfall or teach a debugging strategy.</li>
        <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/TG/openers/snap-judgment.html"><strong>Snap Judgment</strong></a><br> Students write down their view in response to a prompt about a Social Implications topic. This is not meant to be polished writing, or even take a view that students firmly believe. The purpose is to engage students and support written communication skills. Throughout the year, students should develop their ability to state a position and provide evidence to support it.</li>

        	<div>
            <dl>
            <dt>Lesson 4: What is cyberbullying?</dt>
            <dd>Students have likely heard of or even experienced some form of cyberbullying. In Blown to Bits, they will later read a story (page 16) about a student who committed suicide after hurtful comments were aimed at her online. While students generally agree that such tragedies should not occur, they likely differ about their definition of what should be considered cyberbullying. Later, they will engage in a class discussion about possible ways to address cyberbullying. This Snap Judgment is meant to help students clarify for themselves what they mean when they think of "cyberbullying."</dd>
            <dt>Lesson 13: Is technology good or bad?</dt>
            <dd>Technology is not all good or all bad. In this Snap Judgment assignment, look for ways that students use evidence to support claims they make about positive advancements or negative implications of technology. This is not meant to be a polished piece of writing, but should result in students thinking of examples to support their position. In class, they will read pages 13-17 of Blown to Bits which addresses both sides. [Also include link to BDL]</dd>
            <dt>Lesson 17: Do you think everyone who illegally downloads music or movies deserves to be prosecuted?</dt>
            <dd>Students have likely encountered this issue directly in their lives. In this Snap Judgment assignment, students begin to form an argument to support a position. Later in the class, students will receive more information about the issue and engage in a short debate.</dd>
            <dt>Lesson 19: Should violent video games be sold to minors?</dt>
            <dd>This question is the subject of an article that students will read today in class. Students again must construct an argument to support a position. Emphasize the importance of providing reasons and considering counterarguments that might be made by the other side.</dd>
