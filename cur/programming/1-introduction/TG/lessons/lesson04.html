            <div>Snap Judgment: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bQVpIWKUlYonoGchEU1nfeIGtUek8h3amzg9JbVeASU/edit?usp=sharing"><strong>What is cyberbullying?</strong></a><br>
		Students have likely heard of or even experienced some form of cyberbullying. In <em>Blown to Bits</em>, they will later read a story (page 16) about a student who committed suicide after hurtful comments were aimed at her online. While students generally agree that such tragedies should not occur, they likely differ about their definition of what should be considered cyberbullying. Later, they will engage in a class discussion about possible ways to address cyberbullying. This Snap Judgment is meant to help students clarify for themselves what they mean when they think of "cyberbullying."</div>
