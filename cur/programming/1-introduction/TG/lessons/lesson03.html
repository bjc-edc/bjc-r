        <h3>Research</h3>

        <strong>Guiding Question</strong>: What does Tanya Rider's story have to do with the explosion of bits?</p>
        <p>Much of <em>Blown to Bits</em> has to do with the balance between the abundance of digital information and our attempts for retaining privacy and ownership of our own information. Have students read the selection with the guiding question in mind, then discuss briefly. Students may also be interested in looking up news stories or videos about Tanya Rider. Examples:
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/10247516.html">Sheriff apologizes to husband of trapped woman (Komo News)</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/09/experience-trapped-in-ravine">Experience: I was trapped in a ravine for eight days (The Guardian)</a></li></ul> </p>

        	<li>There are many options for students to access <em>Blown to Bits</em>. They can read it as an <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter1.pdf">online PDF</a> or you may choose to purchase hard copies of the book. You may also photocopy the book for students so that they can make annotations as they read.</li>
            <li>As students finish making their Kaleidoscope program, they should save their work and upload a link to the Google classroom feed or some other platform. Make sure students know how to use this feature. Giving students the opportunity to showcase their work can inspire greater creativity and more ownership of their learning.</li>
