        <h3>Students will:</h3>
        
        <div class="sidenote"><div><strong>Looking ahead</strong></div>
        	<div><ul>
            	<li>...</li>
        	</ul></div></div>
        <div>
        <ul>
        	<li>Practice pair programming</li>
            <li>Incorporate x- and y-positions in their scripts</li>
            <li>Explore and use <code>forever</code></li>

        <h3>During this lab, look for:</h3>
            <ul>
            	<li>Students may notice that when you drag a block into another block of the same category, the coloring changes to alternate between light and dark versions of the block color (aka "zebra coloring").</li>
                <li>After students make a Kaleidoscope, there is a section called "Take It Further." These sections (in purple) are <em>optional</em> for students, in that they can proceed to future labs without having completed these problems. "Take It Further" problems are interesting extensions on problems students have seen; some have an increased level of difficulty, while others do not. These problems offer some differentiation support, in that students who finish the required elements earlier have additional problems to try. However, these problems are not provided merely to be "more stuff to do" but to convey to students that there are many creative ways to apply what they're learning, and they are certainly encouraged to continue exploring beyond any given assignment.</li>
