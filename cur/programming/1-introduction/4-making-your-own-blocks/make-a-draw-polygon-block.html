    	<h2>Make a <code>Draw Polygon</code> Block</h2>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
	        <ol>
            	<li>Now, create a <code>draw polygon</code> block that takes two inputs:
	            <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/polyblock.png" alt="draw polygon () sides of length ()">
                <ul>
                    <li>a number of sides and</li>
					<li>the length of each side.</li>
                </ul>
    	  		<div class="sidenote">You learned how to draw a regular polygon in a <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-repeating-commands/the-repeat-block.html">previous lesson</a>. How many degrees altogether? How many turns?</div>
  				<p> In the block, call these inputs <code>sides</code> and <code>length</code>. This exercise should be done with a partner, so introduce yourself to your neighbor and get started on the exercise together. </p>
      	  		<p>Be sure to test out your solution with several polygons, with different lengths and number of sides.</p>
