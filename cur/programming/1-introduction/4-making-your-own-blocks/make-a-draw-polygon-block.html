    	<h2>Make a <code>Draw Polygon</code> Block</h2>
        <p>This is the kind of project where pair programming can be especially useful.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
	        <ol>
            	<li>Now, create a <code>draw polygon</code> block that takes two inputs:
	            <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/polyblock.png" alt="draw polygon () sides of length ()">
                <ul>
                    <li>a number of sides and</li>
					<li>the length of each side.</li>
                </ul>
    	  		<div class="sidenote">You learned how to draw a regular polygon in a <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-repeating-commands/the-repeat-block.html">previous lesson</a>. How many degrees altogether? How many turns?</div>
  				<p> In the block, call these inputs <code>sides</code> and <code>length</code>. </p>
      	  		<p>Be sure to test out your solution with several polygons, with different lengths and number of sides.</p>
               	</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <ol><li>
             <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-repeating-commands/the-repeat-block.html">Look back,</a> if you like, to see how you nested squares in squares. Figure out how to create a new procedure <code>nested polygons</code> with two or three levels of nesting, and inputs that tell how many <code>sides</code> and what side <code>length</code> to use.
