    	<h2>Developing and Editing Blocks</h2>
        <p>These projects are the kind where pair programming can be especially useful.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
	        <ol>
            	<li>Create a <code>draw polygon</code> block that takes two inputs:
	            <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/polyblock.png" alt="draw polygon () sides of length ()">
                <ul>
                    <li>a number of sides and</li>
					<li>the length of each side.</li>
                </ul>
    	  		<div class="sidenote">You learned how to draw a regular polygon in a <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-repeating-commands/the-repeat-block.html">previous lesson</a>. How many degrees altogether? How many turns?</div>
  				<p> In the block, call these inputs <code>sides</code> and <code>length</code>. </p>
      	  		<p>Be sure to test out your solution with several polygons, with different lengths and number of sides.</p>
               	</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <div>
                <ol start="2">
                    <li>
                        <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-repeating-commands/the-repeat-block.html">Look back,</a> if you like, to see how you nested squares in squares. Figure out how to create a new procedure <code>nested polygons</code> with two or three levels of nesting, and inputs that tell how many <code>sides</code> and what side <code>length</code> to use. You might want also to add a third input that tells by what factor to reduce the size of the nested polygons so that you can easily experiment with different reductions.
                  </li>
                    <li>This whimsical project&mdash;making a creature dance&mdash;is about <em>editing someone else's blocks</em> to see how the program works, so that you can learn from the ideas and invent versions of your own.
                      <ol>
                        <div class="sidenote">This project uses some blocks that you have not experimented with before. It also uses a new idea, the idea that you can change the look of a sprite by changing its <em>costume</em> At the top of the Scripting Area are three tabs: Scripts, Costumes, and Sounds. You can click on these to see wha's in them. </div> 
                         <li>Load this <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/building-blocks/bug-dance-starter-with-sound.xml"><span class="snap">snap</span> project</a>. (Or, <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/building-blocks/bug-dance-starter.xml">this</a> is the same thing without the big sound file). We've made some starter custom blocks for you, in the "Looks" palette.</li>
                         <li>Edit them to see what we've done.</li>
                         <li>We've included a few examples of how to put them together for a dance.  Try them out.</li>
                         <li>Make custom blocks to do complicated steps, or to repeat sets of steps in ways that you'll do over and over.</li>
                         <li>Add inputs to your custom blocks to change your steps in interesting ways.</li>
                         <li>We've included several costumes in the project that you should use in new steps&mdash;look at how we used the costumes in the custom blocks we already created.</li>
                         <li>You could import your own sounds if you would like.  Go to the "Sounds" tab above the scripting area and drag a sound from your computer.</li>
                  <li>After you and your pair programmer have worked out some ideas of your own,  look at what other programmers have done and chat.  If you see something nice, spend some time trying to incorporate that design into your program.</li> </ol> </li>
