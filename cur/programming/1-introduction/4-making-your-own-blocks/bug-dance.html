            Every good programmer goes through this at some point, and we think that you are ready.
            <br>
            <br>
            You need to make a bug dance.

(Or, <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/building-blocks/bug-dance-starter.xml">this</a> is the same thing without the big sound file). We've made some starter custom blocks for you, in the "Looks" palette.</li>
                <li>Edit them to see what we've done.</li>
                <li>We've included a few examples of how to put them together for a dance.  Try them out.</li>
                <li>Make custom blocks to do complicated steps, or to repeat sets of steps in ways that you'll do over and over.</li>
                <li>Add inputs to your custom blocks to change your steps in interesting ways.</li>
                <li>We've included several costumes in the project that you should use in new steps&mdash;look at how we used the costumes in the custom blocks we already created.</li>
                <li>You could import your own sounds if you would like.  Go to the "Sounds" tab above the scripting area and drag a sound from your computer.</li>
                <li>After you've worked on this for a bit, take a moment to look at what other students have done and chat.  If you see something nice, spend some time trying to incorporate that design into your program.</li>
