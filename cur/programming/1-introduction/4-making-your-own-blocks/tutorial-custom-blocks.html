        <h2>Your First Custom Block</h2>
        <p>Up until now, you used blocks that already existed. You will now learn how to build your own blocks. As an example, you will start by making a block that draws a square and you will name this new block <code>draw square</code>. Here's how:</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>
					<img alt="'make a block'" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/make-a-block.png" class="imageRight" />
                    At the bottom of the "Variables" palette, click on "Make a block."  (As a short-cut, you can right-click or control-click on the scripting area background and choose "Make a block").    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>This  opens up the "Make a block" dialog box. You get to choose which tab you want your new block to go into. You can put it anywhere you like, but drawing a square is so much like drawing a line that it makes sense to put it in "Motion". (If you forget this step, your block will become a gray "Other" block to be found in the Variables tab.)</p>
                    <img  alt="'make a block' dialog box" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/make-a-block-BYOB.png" >
                </li>
    
                <li> Now you have four choices to make.
                <ol>
                   <li> Then give your block a name. Type "draw square" as shown here.</li><br />
                    <img  alt="Make a command block" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/make-draw-square-block.png" >
                 <li>This block is a Command, like <code>move</code>, not a Reporter. (You will learn about "Predicate" later.) The "Command" icon is already selected, and this is the one you want, so you don't change it. </li>
                  <li>In this course, you will almost always want to keep "for all sprites" selected, so you can ignore that choice for now.</li>
                  <li>Click "OK".</li></ol>
                <li>
                    <p>After you click "OK", a dialog titled "Block Editor" will appear.</p>
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/empty-draw-square-BYOB.png" alt="Block Editor for 'draw square'" >
                    <p>Inside the you will see a specially shaped block with the title of the custom block that you are creating. This kind of block is called a "hat" block, and it indicates a starting place for the <code>draw square</code> script.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can treat this dialog like you do the scripting area of the main <span class="snap">snap</span> window.  Drag blocks here from the palette to define the script that will run when your custom block is used.
                    </p>
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <p>Use the blocks from the "Control" and "Motion" palettes to create a script that draws a square, as shown below.</p>
                    <img  alt="Script to draw a square" src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/draw-square-no-arguments.png" >
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <p>When you click "OK", you should be able to use this block as if it were a regular block. Since you created the block as a "Motion" block, it will end up at the bottom of the "Motion" tab.</p>
                    <img alt="Using the 'draw square' block" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/draw-square-block-BYOB.gif" />
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>Congratulations! You have just created your first custom block.</p>
