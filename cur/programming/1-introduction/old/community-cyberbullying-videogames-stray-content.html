		<h2>Communication and Community, Cyberbullying, VIDEO GAMES, etc.</h2>
		        <h1>PRE-EXPLORE</h1>
                <li>Review the <a href="https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=79" target="_blank">CSP Explore task</a> specification. Its requirements are pretty narrow (e.g., students must discuss how a chosen innovation uses data, and must prepare both a paper and a multimedia presentation). We certainly want to prepare students for this requirement, but our aims are broader; we want them to develop the intellectual tools to understand technology and society more deeply.</li>
		<h1>MOVE TO U2 SI LAB (PREP)</h1>
                <li>Continue to think about how your classroom space is set up. If it is possible to move away from computers and even arrange chairs in a circle, this will help establish a discussion space.</li>
                
             
        
				<li>40-60 minutes (1-2 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/4-privacy/old/4-ways-we-communicate.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Communication and Community</a></li>
				<li>40-60 minutes (1-2 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/4-privacy/old/5-cyberbullying.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Cyberbullying</a></li>
                <h1>PURPOSE</h1>
            <h2>communication</h2>
            <p>Students then examine communications technology and discuss ways in which computing affects our ability to build community. </p>
            <h2>cyberbullying</h2>
            <p>Finally, students end by learning about cyberbullying: why people bully, how computing affects the nature and seriousness of bullying, and how social decisions about technology (such as sites devoted to anonymous posting) affect the issue.</p>
            <h2>cyberbullying</h2>
            <p>Discussing cyberbullying also gets students to think about how the Internet can bring out the worst in people. This is a serious discussion about a potentially personal and sensitive topic, and is an opportunity to reinforce your classroom as a safe space to pursue these topics.</p>
            <h2>communication</h2>
            <p>Different modes of communication is a topic on the AP exam. They will only begin learning about how these technologies work in this Lab. What they learn now will make more sense as they learn more about how the Internet works.</p>
            <h2>VIDEO GAMES</h2>
        debating the hot topic of how violent video games might (or might not) relate to youth violence
		
        
        <h1>PREPARE</h1>
        <li>Several activities in this lab ask students to make videos. Be sure to know your school's policy on publication of images of students; you may have to warn students not to post their videos on social media, or alternatively to make videos in which they do not appear onscreen.</li>
                <li>If you haven't yet, make sure you use <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-teaching-guide.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016_teacher.html&novideo&noassignment">Computing in the News</a> as an opener this week.</li>
                <h2>VIDEO GAMES</h2>
                <li>Review all lab activities, especially the debate activities included with Do violent video games contribute to youth violence? (<a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Skill-5-Counterargument-DRMO-One-Pager.docx" target="_blank">making counterarguments</a>) and Is technology good or bad? (<a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Brainstorm-Game-Narrative.pdf" target="_blank">brainstorm game</a>).</li>
                
                
        <h1>GOALS</h1>
        <li>Find out how some communications technologies work.</li>
                <li>Think about how computing affects our sense of community.</li>
                <li>Learn about cyberbullying and think of ways to address this issue.</li>

        <h1>AS A CLASS</h1>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 4: Communication and Community</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Problem 2 asks students to conduct online research. As students work, make sure they visit more than one site to get their information.</li>
                        <li>The Take It Further video is not meant to be elaborate, but is a way to help students process what they learned in their online research. By having to explain it, they may come to understand what they read more clearly.</li>
                        <li>Problem 3 introduces two new topics. The statements "Computers are isolating" and "Computers are democratizing" will likely need to be explained to students. This <a href="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/isolating-democratizing.pptx" target="_blank">PowerPoint about community</a> is a resource for you (you may share it with students if you wish) that gives examples of why/why not computers are isolating and why/why not computers are democratizing. Student discussions will be much better if you present at least some of these examples before they take positions.</li>
                        <li>This <a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Four-Corners-Narrative.pdf" target="_blank">Four Corners activity description</a> is taken from the Boston Debate League.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>There's only one socially acceptable position on bullying, but clearly not everyone agrees with it, or there wouldn't be any bullies. So this is a discussion in which you'll have to be especially careful to protect students' right to disagree. You're unlikely to hear a blanket defense of bullying, but, for example, some students may feel that retaliatory bullying (bullying the bully) is okay. Others may feel that if the First Amendment protects Nazi and KKK rallies, it should also protect cyberbullying. Bend over backward to make room for these opinions in the discussion.</li>
                        <li>Have students work in small groups for 10-15 minutes researching the issue of cyberbullying online.</li>

                        <li>
                            Students will engage in a 25-30 minute discussion. There are three parts to this discussion:
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>
                                    Share some of the findings from the online research on the question: <em>What are some different forms that cyberbullying can take?</em> Students can share stories they found or different definitions of cyberbullying.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Possible follow-up question: Did anyone find themselves re-thinking their Snap Judgment response from the beginning of class?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Next, discuss: <em>What are some possible ways to effectively address this issue?</em> Students may choose to focus on what they can do individually, what they should think should happen in schools, or what should be done at a societal level.</li>
                                <li>Finally, discuss: <em>What are the challenges to addressing cyberbullying?</em> For example, students may raise First Amendment rights, privacy issues regarding their communication, or the ability to assume other identities or operate anonymously online.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Snap Judgment:</strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bQVpIWKUlYonoGchEU1nfeIGtUek8h3amzg9JbVeASU/edit?usp=sharing"><strong>What is cyberbullying?</strong></a><br />
                            Students have likely heard of or even experienced some form of cyberbullying. In <em>Blown to Bits</em>, they will later read a story (page 16) about a student who committed suicide after hurtful comments were aimed at her online. While students generally agree that such tragedies should not occur, they likely differ about their definition of what should be considered cyberbullying. Later, they will engage in a class discussion about possible ways to address cyberbullying. This Snap Judgment is meant to help students clarify for themselves what they mean when they think of "cyberbullying."
