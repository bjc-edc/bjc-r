        <h2>Saving Your Work</h2> 
        <p>From time to time, save your work.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
        	<ol>
            	<li>
                	You must first have an account. If you do not already have one, make one now. At the top left corner of the Snap<em>!</em> browser window, find the cloud-shaped button in the toolbar:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-cloud-with-context.png" alt="cloud icon"/>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<p>Click it, select the "sign up" option in the menu, and follow the instructions. After creating your account, check your email  to get your initial password.</p>
                	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/dialog-cloud-signup.png" alt="signing up for the cloud"/>
                	<p>You may change your password at any time, using the cloud-button <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="Cloud button"/>. Always choose passwords that you will easily remember but that are hard for others to figure out.</p>
        		</li>
                <li>
                	<p>That didn't save your work. It just created a space for <em>your</em> work. Now, use the File button <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button"/> in the tool bar to save your work so far. <em>Give it a name that will help you remember what the project is.</em> </p>
        			<p>Any time you want that work back, you will use the same button and select "Open..." to see a list of your files.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
