        <h2>Reporters</h2>

        	<ul>
            	<li>JK: Teachers at the EDC BJC day had trouble with them. They suggested an animated gif to show this process rather than the two images here. They also didn't read the problem so they really didn't understand (these teachers kept not reading. But if teachers don't read, then students won't read.). I think they were confused because the first sentence explains what the watcher is, so they expected to have already known what the watcher is - maybe this is a matter of just switching the order of the sentences so that the first sentence is last.</li>

              	<li>Click on the sprite on the stage, and drag it a bit to the right of the center of the stage.</li>
            	<li> Drag an <code>x position</code> block into the scripting area and click on it.  You should see a  speech balloon next to the block:<br />
                	<img src="/bjc-r-2017-18/img/topic1/xpos-bubble.png" alt="X Position speech balloon"/>
                </li>
              	<li>Now, drag the sprite to some new location on the stage and click on the <code>x position</code> block again.</li>
              	<li> You can create a <strong>watcher</strong> that sits on the stage and constantly displays the <em>x</em>-position of the sprite. In the palette, click on the gray box to the left of the <code>x position</code> block. Now drag the sprite around and see what that watcher says.

                </li>
            	<li>Create watchers for <code>y position</code> and <code>direction</code>. Move the sprite around, using commands or just by dragging it with your mouse. Notice which values change and  which values <em>don't</em>.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
                <p>The three oval-shaped blocks at the bottom of the Motion palette are called <strong>reporters</strong>.  Unlike the jigsaw-puzzle-shaped <strong>command</strong> blocks, reporters don't carry out an action (such as moving the sprite  or displaying a speech balloon).  Instead, they <em>report a value</em>, usually for use in another block's input slot.</p>
        <p>The <img src="/bjc-r-2017-18/img/topic1/topic1_xposition.png" alt="X Position Reporter" class="block"/> and <img src="/bjc-r-2017-18/img/topic1/topic1_yposition.png" alt="Y Position Reporter" class="block"/> reporters tell you where the sprite is on the stage.  As in algebra, <em>x</em> means left-to-right position, and <em>y</em> means bottom-to-top position.</p>
