        	In this lab, you'll code a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-gameboard-with-3-tiles.png" alt="draw gamboard with (3) tiles per row" title="draw gamboard with (3) tiles per row" /> block that can be used for Tic Tac Toe and other games, and you'll build a simple Tic&nbsp;Tac&nbsp;Toe game, like this:<br />
            <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Simpler-TicTacToe-video.gif" width="312" alt="Tic Tac Toe video">
        </p>
        <p>So far, you've only used blocks that already existed in Snap<em>!</em>. Now, you'll learn to build your own blocks and use them to make other blocks.</p>
        <p>
            To build the Tic Tac Toe gameboard, you'll start by defining a <code>draw square</code> block with a familiar script:  <!--Then, you'll define <code>draw triangle</code>, then <code>draw house</code>, and finally <code>draw row of houses</code>.--><br />
            <!--<img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/row-houses.png" alt="Row of 4 Houses" title="Row of 4 Houses" />-->

        <div class="takeNote">Creating a block gives a <em>name</em> to a script that can be called in multiple places across a program.

	        <h4><strong>Optional Details on Making a Custom Block</strong></h4>
            Every block needs a place to "live" (a <strong>palette</strong>, shown by the color), a <strong>title</strong>, a <strong>category</strong> (shown by the shape of the block), and a <strong>script</strong> that defines its behavior.
			<ul>
				<li> 
                    <div class="sideHOMbig">You can put the new block in any palette that makes sense to you. If you don't choose a palette/color, your block will be a gray "Other" block and will be sorted into the "Variables" palette.</div> 
                    <strong>Palette:</strong> Choose a palette for your new block. (You might choose "Motion" or "Pen" for the <code>draw square</code> block.)<br />

                <li> 
                    <strong>Title:</strong> Give your block a name. For this block, type "draw square" as shown here.<br />

                </li>
                <li><strong>Category:</strong> Leave "Command" selected since this block  performs an action (drawing a square) rather than reporting a value.</li>
				<div class="takeNote">In this course, you will almost always want to keep "for all sprites" selected, so you can ignore that choice for now, and <strong>click "OK."</strong></div>
                <li>
                    <strong>Define the behavior of the <code>draw square</code> script:</strong> When the "Block Editor"  appears, drag blocks from the palette into the editor to define the script for your new block just as you have done before. <!--<a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-drawing-interaction/1-exploring-snap-drawing-motion.html#building">Drag blocks from the palette to define the script that will run when your custom block is used. -->When finished, click "OK" or "Apply".<br />
