                <li>POSTPONE THIS PAGE AND THE NEXT UNTIL AFTER MAKING BLOCKS FOR <strong>SQUARE</strong>, <strong>ROW</strong>, AND <strong>ARRAY</strong></li>
                <li>
                	"Draw in red" block unclear: We've gotten several comments about this. I made the sidenote more clear, but there is a bigger issue, namely that <strong>we haven't taught students how to create custom blocks yet</strong>. --MF
                    <ul>
                        <li>GH Feedback 9/20/15: You're asking the students to write a block "draw in red" before they have learned how to create blocks.</li>
                        <li>GH Feedback 9/22/15: My students were confused about the "draw in red" block. Did I miss a lesson where they were taught to create blocks on their own by using other blocks?</li>
                        <li>GH Feedback 9/27/15: What does "you write draw in red mean"? I don't understand.</li>
                        <li>GH Feedback 9/28/15: I dont understand what to do in step 4. It is not clear.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
				<li>GH Feedback 9/22/15: I love question 1, but my kids blew right by the questions asked and instead just created the scripts in Snap and ran them all at the same time in the same sprite! More scaffolding would be great.</li>

                    <strong>Analyze and predict:</strong> How are the behaviors of these four scripts the same? How are they different? <br />

                <li>Give Sprite a script that, when the green flag is clicked, draws a blue square, drawing each line at some medium speed.</li>
                <div class="endnote">When you are finished, double-check that your script does exactly what you mean for it to. This is always a good idea when coding because if you move on with part of the program still not working, you will only compound your problems.</div>

                	Create a second sprite with a script that does this:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r-2017-18/img/1-introduction/draw-in-red-script.png" alt="when flag clicked, draw in red, forever (point toward Sprite, move 5 steps)"><br />
                <!--    <div class="sideHOMbig">One "line" of pseudo-code may require more than one line of code in the language you are using. For example, "draw in red" requires two <span class="snap">snap</span> commands, one so that the sprite draws when it moves, and one to set the pen's color.</div>	  -->

                </li>
                <li>Test your program. Make sure that it starts both sprites at the same time.</li>


				<li>Experiment with the speeds of each sprite. 
                    <ol>
                        <li>What happens if Sprite(2) moves 20 steps instead of 5 steps each time it goes through the forever-loop?</li>
                        <li>What if Sprite(2) moves only 2 steps?</li>
                        <li>What if Sprite draws its square more quickly? </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r-2017-18/img/icons/write-out-thoughts.png" alt="Write Out Your Thoughts" title="Write Out Your Thoughts" /> Describe the results of your experiments. Include pictures of the screen to show what happened. Try to explain <em>why</em> each picture came out as it did.</li>
          </ol>
		</div>
	
    	<div class="takeItFurther">
            <p>Sprite doesn't need to move in a square. Try one or more of the following experiments.</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Change Sprite's turn to 144 degrees.</li>
                <li> Change Sprite's turn so that it makes an equilateral triangle. </li>
                <li>Change Sprite's turn to 10 degrees and make the distance it moves in each step much smaller than 100.</li>
