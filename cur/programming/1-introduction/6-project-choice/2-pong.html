        	<strong>In this project,</strong> you are going to model a simple game called Pong, first developed by Atari in 1972.  You will write the code for the paddle which will allow it to move up and down based on user keyboard input and also write the code for the ball which will allow it to bounce every time it hits a wall or the paddle.<br />

            <ol>
                <li>Play with the Snap<em>!</em> file <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=bjcsolutions&ProjectName=U1L5Pong_Teacher&hideControls" target="_blank"> linked here </a>to get a feel how the game works.  Use the up and down arrow keys to move the paddle.  The initial angle at which the ball starts is random, so if it is not to your liking, you can reload the page for a different initial angle.</li>

                    Discuss with your partner the mathematics behind the ball bouncing off the paddle.  How does the angle at which the ball hits the paddle relate to the angle at which the ball bounces off the paddle?  The following diagrams may help. <br />

                </li>
                <li>Create the paddle and the ball sprites by drawing the costumes on your own and then try to write the code for the paddle and the ball by yourself.  If you get stuck, look at <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/6-project-choice/2b-pong-hints.html" target="_blank">this page </a>for hints on how to proceed.</li>

            <ol type="A">
                <li>Add scoring to your game.  Every time the paddles bounces off the ball the player should earn a point and every time the ball hits the right wall the player should lose a point.</li>
                <li>Create a second paddle to allow the game to become multiplayer game.  Adjust your code to accommodate keyboard input from two users.</li>

                <li> 
                    Create a second paddle and let this paddle be driven automatically by the computer.  <br />
                    Hint: You can fully automate the second paddle by using the following block from the Sensing menu:<br />

                </li>
                <li> You may notice that sometimes when the ball hits the paddle at a steep angle, the ball gets “trapped”.  Why do you think this is so?  Which part of your code is responsible for this?  Can you improve your code so that this does not happen?</li>
