        <h2>Robot in A Simple Maze (Teacher's Choice)</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">ST-Put the correct links to Snap files</div>

        <div class="learn">
            <strong>In this project,</strong> you are given a Snap<em>!</em> file <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/U1L5-robot-in-simple-maze-student.xml" target="_blank">linked here</a> with some custom made Motion blocks that allow a Robot to navigate in a simple maze. Five mazes have been created for you.  Your job is to write code for the Robot that will allow it to escape each maze.  The code should be as simple, concise and elegant as possible.<br />

        </div>

        <p>
            The custom made Motion blocks for the Robot, already written for you, are:<br />

        <p>
            Here are some steps to write the code for escaping from the first maze.  Maze#1 and Robot’s escape path are shown below.  Robot is represented by the Arrow sprite:<br />

            <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Robot_img/1b_Maze1Path.png"  height="300" alt=""/>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can start by expressing the task at hand in English to create a simple pseudocode.<br />
            <div class="indent"><em>
                Robot must first turn left,<br />
                Then move forward 7 steps, <br />
                Then turn right, <br />
                Then move another 7 steps.<br />
            </em></div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, you can write the following code for the <code>escapeMaze1</code> custom block in the Robot sprite:        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Robot_img/RobotinaMazeTitle.png" width="300"  alt=""/>

            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Robot_img/1c_escapeMaze1Code1.png" width="173"  alt=""/>
        </p>
        <p>
            You may notice that the <code>repeat (7)</code>. block appears twice so the following nested repeat blocks may save us a step.  This works, because once the Robot reaches the destination, we don’t worry about the direction it is facing.<br />

                <li>
                    For each of the following mazes created for you (see the <code>Board</code> sprite), write the <b>shortest</b> and <b>most elegant</b> code possible for the relevant <code>escapeMaze</code> block that will allow the Robot to escape that particular maze.  Compare solutions as a class.<br />

                    Create your own maze and your own Robot escape code for that maze.  Study and edit the <code>drawYourMaze</code> code in the <code>Board</code> sprite. If you change some of the 0’s to 1’s you will notice that you will be creating a path for the Robot to travel in the maze.  It is important to understand that the <code>boardMatrix</code> is a list of lists and each list of 0’s and 1’s will correspond to a row of gray and white squares in the maze.  Play around with the <code>boardMatrix</code> until you get a maze you like, then write the <code>escapeYourMaze</code> code for the Robot.<br />

                <li>Can you create intelligent code that will allow the Robot to escape any given <em>simple</em> maze?  By "<em>simple</em>" we can understand it to mean that there is a <u>single path</u> from start to finish and that there are <u>no paths</u> that lead to nowhere.  This challenge is in the realm of the study of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</li>
