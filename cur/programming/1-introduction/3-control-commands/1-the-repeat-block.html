        <p style="width:50%;float:left;">  makes this script shorter and simpler to construct. Also, the structure (the logic of the script) is clearer when we see this: -->
        
        	It is, of course, much easier to create this script...<br />
        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/repeat-4(move-50-turn-right-90).png" alt="repeat 4 (move 50 steps, turn right 90 degrees)" title="repeat 4 (move 50 steps, turn right 90 degrees)" /><br />
        	...than to create this one:
        </p>
<p>
        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-50-turn-right-90-(4-times).png" alt="move 50 steps, turn right 90 degrees, move 50 steps, turn right 90 degrees, move 50 steps, turn right 90 degrees, move 50 steps, turn right 90 degrees" title="move 50 steps, turn right 90 degrees, move 50 steps, turn right 90 degrees, move 50 steps, turn right 90 degrees, move 50 steps, turn right 90 degrees" />
        </p>
        <br clear="all" />
        <p>Even more important than ease, using <code>repeat</code> makes the <em>structure</em> of the program clearer. </p>
        <p> That is essential to good coding. Clearly structured code is easier to understand and easier to debug (to catch and fix errors).</p>
        <p>In that longer script (without <code>repeat</code>), we'd have to count the parts to see if it's right. It would be very easy to make a mistake if we were drawing a 20-sided figure instead of a 4-sided one!</p>

      <li>For each picture, write pseudo-code that describes how to draw it. <br /> You don't need to say how long each side is or how many degrees to turn. <br /> You do need to show what repeats and how many times it repeats.</li>

                <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Create <span class="snap">snap</span> scripts from your pseudo-code and experiment with the number of degrees to make your pictures match the ones here. (Don't worry about matching the size exactly.)</li>

            	<div class="todo">JK: Comment from EDC BJC PD day: Some teachers didn't understand the point of going through a triangle, then a square, then pentagon, etc. They said that wanted some sort of indication like "Look for the pattern" to alert them to the fact that they should be thinking that way. I'm not sure I agree 100%, but it's something to think about.</div>
	            <div class="todo">MF: Need more support for angles?<ul>                        <li>MF and PG: Include an animation of a script like (repeat 90: move 1 step, turn 1 degree, wait .01 secs) and use it to explain the exterior/interior angle thing. </li>
	              <li>BH: But without saying anything about interior angles! Just say that a small turn keeps the sprite going almost in the same direction, and a bigger turn is a bigger change of direction. And then later teach the TTTT.</li>
