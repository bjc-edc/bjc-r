		<h3><code>for</code> and <code>repeat</code> dialoges</h3>
        
        <div class="dialogue"><!--dialogues shouuld either be 2 or 4 people since kids will be in pairs or talking to another pair, right?-->
            <div><span>1:</span> Well, the computer does <em>something</em> when you press the up key.</div>
            <div><span>2:</span> Yeah, and then it does that "for <em>n</em> equals 40 to 70" thing... whatever that is...</div>
            <div><span>1:</span> And the next block "says" the letter <em>n</em>... out loud?</div>
            <div><span>2:</span> Oh, and then it plays the note <em>n</em> for a quarter of  beat! That "point two five beats" is a quarter note!</div>
            <div class="stagedir">2 points to the last block in the script.</div>
            <!--Charcter 2 knows music-->
            <div><span>1:</span> Cool! So, if it's playing notes out loud, then maybe for "say <em>n</em>" it just says <em>n</em> on the screen...</div>
            <div><span>2:</span> The program decides what <em>n</em> is in that C-shaped, "for" thing.</div>
            <div><span>1:</span> What does it mean "for <em>n</em> equals 40 to 70"?</div>
            <!--I deliberately have each charcter reading the 'for' loop out loud. -Mary-->
            <div><span>2:</span> Maybe it's like how if I were to plan a vacation "for August 8 to 13." It means all those days...</div>
            <div><span>1:</span> So the computer "says" and "plays" all those numbers?</div>
        </div>
                    
		<div class="dialogue">
            <div><span>1:</span> So, the computer does something "when you press the space bar."</div>
            <div><span>1:</span> It "clears" something... like the screen?</div>
            <div><span>1:</span> Then, it puts the "pen down".</div>
            <div><span>1:</span> And then it does "repeat 4." So, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4... Or maybe repeats 4 times?</div>
            <div><span>1:</span> Well, there is stuff inside of that "repeat 4". It says turn 90 degrees and move 50 steps.</div>
            <div><span>1:</span> Oh, it's a drawing program! It's telling the computer to put the pen down and follow these instructions.</div>
            <div><span>1:</span> What do think it does?</div>
         </div>
