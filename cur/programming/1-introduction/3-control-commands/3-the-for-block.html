		<h2>The <code>For</code> Block</h2>
        
        <p>Programs often require repeating a set of actions. You have already used three ways and will learn a fourth in this lab session.
<ul>
                <li>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png" alt="the forever block" title="the forever block" /> block is appropriate when you want to repeat the same thing <em>forever</em>.</li>
                <li>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="the repeat block" title="the repeat block" /> block is appropriate when you want to repeat the same thing <em>a specific number of times</em>.</li>
                <li>The <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat-until.png"  alt="repeat until"> block is appropriate when you want to repeat the same thing until some special condition occurs.</li>
            	<li>The <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/for.png" class="imageCenter" alt="for"> block is appropriate when you want to repeat <em>almost</em> the same thing with a change in each step.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        	The <code>for</code> block lets you simplify long scripts like:<br />    
    	    <div class="sidenoteBig">
                <p class="center"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" /></p>
                In the current version of <span class="snap">snap</span>, the <code>for</code> block isn't installed automatically. Click on the File <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-file-menu.png" class="inline" style="height:1.7em;" alt="File menu icon" title="File menu icon" /> menu at the top of the <span class="snap">snap</span> window and select "Import Tools." You'll need to import tools once into each new <span class="snap">snap</span> project where you need <code>for</code>. 
            </div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/for-loop-equivalent.png" alt="say (1) for (2) secs, say (2) for (2) secs, say (3) for (2) secs... say (10) for (2) secs" title="say (1) for (2) secs, say (2) for (2) secs, say (3) for (2) secs... say (10) for (2) secs" /><br />
	        to:  <br />
            <div class="sidenoteBig">The <code>for</code> block counts by 1 from the first number to the last number, running the script inside it. As the <code>for</code> block counts, it keeps track of the changing number with the variable <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png" alt="i" title="i" />. You can <em>use</em> the  number in that script. The animation shows how.</div>

            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>The example above shows a script that counts from 1 to 10. Build it and modify it so that it counts 0, 2, 4, 6, 8... up to 30.</li>

                		This design got the nickname "squiral" because it looks like a square spiral.

					<li>Try switching the order of the 100 and the 1 in the <code>for</code> block in the squiral script. What is the result?</li>
                    <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Try changing the turning angle in the squiral script to other numbers such as 92, 126, etc.</li>
                    <li>
                        Change the turn angle and the move steps to get as close as you can get to a smooth spiral:<br />
