                <li>MF: add building this script:<br /> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/count-to-10.png" alt="for i = 1 to 10 (say i for 1 secs)" title="for i = 1 to 10 (say i for 1 secs)" /></li>

        <p>Repeating parts of your program is a very common practice in programming.  There are many ways to do it. You have already used two of them:
        	<ul>
                <li>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png"> block is appropriate when you want to repeat the same behavior <em>forever</em>.</li>
                <li>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png"> block is appropriate when you want to repeat the same behavior <em>a specific number of times</em>.</li>
            	<li>The <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/for.png" class="imageCenter" alt="for"> block (see <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools-mini.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" /> at right) is appropriate when you want to repeat <em>almost</em> the same behavior with a change in each step.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <div class="sidenoteBig">
            <p class="center"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" /></p>
            In the current version of <span class="snap">snap</span>, the <code>for</code> block isn't installed automatically. Click on the File <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-file-menu.png" class="inline" style="height:1.7em;" alt="File menu icon" title="File menu icon" /> menu at the top of the <span class="snap">snap</span> window and select "Import Tools." You'll need to import tools once into each new <span class="snap">snap</span> project where you need <code>for</code> or other tool blocks. 
        </div>

        <div class="sidenoteBig">The numbers in the <code>for</code> block work as you might expect: the <code>for</code> block counts by 1 from the first number to the last number, running the script inside the C-shape with the new number each time.   
        As the <code>for</code> block counts, it keeps track of the changing number with a variable, the orange oval set to <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png" alt="i" title="i" /> by default, which you can drag into the blocks inside the <code>for</code> loop.
		</div>
                    
        <p>
        	With <code>for</code>, long scripts like:<br />    
    	        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/for-loop-equivalent.png"><br />
	            can be simplfied to:<br />    
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/for-loop-drag-i.gif"><br />
