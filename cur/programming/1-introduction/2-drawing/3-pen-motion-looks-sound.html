            <div class="sidenote">You can build scripts by dragging blocks out from the palette on the left and snapping them together, or just by duplicating an existing script (using two-finger-click or left-click).</div>

                	Guess what this code does. Do not build it yet. Discuss with your partner and perhaps another pair.<br />

        <p>These problems go beyond the basic ideas of the course and may include topics from other subjects. They are often are challenging. Try them if you have extra time or just if you want to.</p>

        	<ol start="13">
                <li>Code a script that says and plays the notes from 40 to 70 and then from 70 to 40.</li>
            	<li>Code a similar script with just 3 blocks that counts from 1 to 10 (with no sound&mdash;just on the screen).</li>
            	<li>Code a script rotates the arrowhead-shaped sprite 5 degrees 10 times.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    
    <p>Blocks in a script run in a specific order, from the top of the script to the bottom. Generally, <span class="snap">snap</span> waits until one block has finished its job before continuing on to the block below it. (One common exception is blocks that play sounds: a block's job can be to <em>start</em> the sound, which means the block below it will execute while the sound is still playing.)</p>
