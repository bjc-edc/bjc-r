                    Play Note Bug?? We've gotten several messages about this, but I have not been able to recreate this error on my machine, so I think the file is fine. I have however seen the bug on NYC school computers (shown below). I have reported this on <a href="https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks/issues/985" target="_blank">the Snap<em>!</em> repo</a>. --MF<br /><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/bugs/play-note-ctx-error.JPG" height="200" alt="" title="" />

        <p>You have already used three ways to repeat a set of actions. 
In this lab, you will learn a fourth  useful way.
<ul>
<li>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png" alt="the forever block" title="the forever block" /> block tells the computer to repeat the same action <em>forever</em>.</li>
                <li>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="the repeat block" title="the repeat block" /> block lets you repeat an action <em>a specific number of times</em>.</li>
                <li>The <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat-until.png"  alt="repeat until"> block lets you repeat an action until some special condition occurs.</li>
            	</ul>
                <p>The <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/for.png" class="imageCenter" alt="for"> block  gives you a variable <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png" alt="i" title="i" />  that says which repetition you are on. You can use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png" alt="i" title="i" /> in the script you are repeating. </p>
            
        </p>
        <p>
        	The <code>for</code> block lets you simplify long scripts like:<br /> <div class="sidenoteBig">Each time the <code>for</code> block  runs your script it changes the value of the variable <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/variable-i.png" alt="i" title="i" />, counting by 1 from the first input number to the second. You can <em>use</em> that variable in your script.<!-- The animation shows how. If you like, you can also change the name of that variable by clicking on it. --></div>

                <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Try changing the turning angle in the squiral script to other numbers such as 92, 126, etc.</li>

                    Here are two scripts to build and explore. When you have figured out how they work, build a script that spells <em>your name backwards</em>.

                </li>
                <li>Here is a block that lets you input any word or phrase and have the sprite spell it out. 
                <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/spell-script.png" alt="definition of spell block: spell(word) ; for i = 1 to (length of word), say (letter i of word) for 0.5 secs)"></p>
