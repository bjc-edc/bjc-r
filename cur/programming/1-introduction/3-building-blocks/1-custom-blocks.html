          Thanks to <a href="http://code.org">code.org</a> for this video!

        <p>So far, you've used blocks that already existed. Now, you'll learn to build your own blocks and use them to make other blocks.</p>
        <p>

            You'll start by defining a <code>draw square</code> block with a familiar script (shown right). Then, you'll define <code>draw triangle</code>, then <code>draw house</code>, and finally <code>draw row of houses</code>.<br />

        <div class="takeNote">Creating a block gives a <em>name</em> to a script that can be called inside another block. This is a form of <strong>abstraction</strong>, tucking away the details of your code to make the overall structure clearer and easier to debug. Soon, you'll learn how to <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-building-blocks/2-adding-an-input.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">give your script an input variable</a>, just as <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-50.png" height="36" alt="move 50 steps" title="move 50 steps"> takes an input to tell the sprite how far to move.</div>

        <div class="endnote">
            Every block needs a place to "live" (a <strong>palette</strong>, shown by the color), a <strong>title</strong>, a <strong>category</strong> (shown by the shape of the block), and a <strong>script</strong> that defines its behavior.
			<ul>
				<li> 
                    <div class="sideHOMbig">You can put the new block in any palette that makes sense to you. If you don't choose a palette/color, your block will be a gray "Other" block and will be sorted into the "Variables" tab.</div> 
                    <strong>Palette:</strong> Choose a palette for your new block to go into. ("Motion" or "Pen" might be appropriate for the <code>draw square</code> block.)<br />

                <li> 
                    <strong>Title:</strong> Give your block a name. For this block, type "draw square" as shown here.<br />

                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Category:</strong> Leave "Command" selected since this block  performs an action (drawing a square) rather than  reporting a value. 
              </li>
                <li><strong>For all sprites.</strong>
                  <!--<div class="takeNote">
                    You've seen commands before and also reporters, which report information, like this:
                    <p class="center">

                  In this course, you will almost always want to keep "for all sprites" selected, so you can ignore that choice for now, and click "OK".

                    <strong>Behavior:</strong> A dialog titled "Block Editor" will appear.

				<div class="takeNote">The editor starts you with a hat block that contains a picture of your block.
