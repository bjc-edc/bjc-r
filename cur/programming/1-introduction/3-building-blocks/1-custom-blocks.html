        <p>
       	Up until now, you used blocks that already existed. You will now learn how to build your own new blocks. Creating a block is a way of giving a <em>name</em> to a script. It also allows you to give your script an input, just like <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-50.png" height="36" alt="move 50 steps" title="move 50 steps"> takes an input to tell it how far to move.</p>
<p>You'll start by giving the name <code>draw square</code> to your script that makes a square.</p>
        <p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/repeat-4(move-50-turn-right-90).png" alt="repeat-4(move-50-turn-clockwise-90)" title="pen down, repeat 4 (move 50 steps, turn CW 90 degrees)" /></p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
            	<li>
                	<div class="sidenote">To get the Block Editor, you can also click <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/make-a-block.png" alt="Make a block" title="Make a block" /> near the bottom of the "Variables" palette.</div>
                To build the <code>draw square</code> block</li>
            	<ul>
            	  <li> Right-click (or, on a Mac, control-click) on the gray background of the scripting area and choose "make a block..." </li>
            	  <li>The video below shows the first few steps. </li>
            	  <li>Finish it yourself, and press OK. </li>
            	  <li>The step-by-step instructions  in the yellow section below give you more detail about what you are doing.<br />
            	    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/make-a-square-block.gif" alt="make a block">
          	    </li>
                
            	</ul>
                <li>Try it out.
                <p>You can use the <code>draw square</code> block exactly the way you have used other blocks. If you created the block as a blue Motion block, you will find it in the Motion palette. <p>
        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pen-down-draw-square.png" alt="pen down, draw square" title="pen down, draw square" /></p>
        <p>Congratulations! You have just created your first custom block.</p></p></li>

        <div class="endnote">
            Every block needs a place to "live" (a palette, shown by the color), a title, a kind (shown by the shape of the block), and a script that defines its behavior.
<ul>
				<li> 
                    <strong>Palette:</strong> Choose a  palette for your new block to go into. <div class="sideHOMbig">You can put the new block in any palette that makes sense to you. If you don't choose a palette/color, your block will be a gray "Other" block and will be sorted into the "Variables" tab.</div> 
                    ("Motion" or "Pen" might be appropriate for the <code>draw square</code> block.)<br />

                <li> 
                    <strong>Title:</strong> Give your block a name. Type "draw square" as shown here.<br />
                    <img  alt="Make a command block" width="260" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/make-draw-square-block.png" >
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Category:</strong> Leave "Command" selected since this block  performs an action (drawing a square) rather than  reporting a value. 
                  <!--<div class="takeNote">
                    You've seen commands before and also reporters, which report information, like this:

                	(In this course, you will almost always want to keep "for all sprites" selected, so you can ignore that choice for now, and click "OK".)
</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Behavior:</strong> A dialog titled "Block Editor" will appear. Build the instructions for your new block here exactly as you do in the scripting area:  <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-drawing-interaction/1-exploring-snap-drawing-motion.html#building">Drag blocks from the palette</a> to define the script that will run when your custom block is used. When you are finished, click "OK".<br />
                    
                    <img class="indent" width="260" alt="Script to draw a square" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/empty-draw-square.png" > <div class="takeNote">The editor starts you with a special=shaped block that contains your block's title. Blocks of this shape can fit only at the <em>top</em> of a script, which is why they're nicknamed "hat" blocks. Hat blocks say when the script below them should  run: when flag clicked, when space key pressed, etc. This hat block says, "when the <code>draw square</code> block is used..."</div>
