        <h2>Designing Custom Blocks</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
        <ul>
        	<li>JK: Teachers at the EDC PD day wanted an animation on this page. They got stuck on these instructions. (They also really didn't like to read.)</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        
        <img class="imageRight" alt="Script to draw a square" src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/draw-square-no-arguments.png" >
        <div>Up until now, you used blocks that already existed. You will now learn how to build your own blocks. You will start by making a block that draws a square and you will name this new block <code>draw square</code>. Here's how:</div>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>At the bottom of the "Variables" palette, click on <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/make-a-block.png" alt="Make a block" title="Make a block" /></li>
                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/make-a-block.jpg" alt="Make a block option in scripting area" title="Make a block option in scripting area" />
                <div class="endnote">As a short-cut, you can right-click (or control-click) on the scripting area background and choose "Make a block" (shown right). This opens up the same "Make a block" dialog box shown below.</div>
                <li>
                	Every block needs a category (color), a title, a stype (shape), and a script that defines its behavior.
                	<ol>
                    	<li> 
                       		<strong>Category:</strong> Choose the tab of the category you want your new block to go into. ("Motion" or "Pen" might be nice for the <code>draw square</code> block.<br />
                    		<div class="sidenote">You can put the new block in any category that makes sense to you. If you don't choose a Category/color, your block will be a gray "Other" block and will be sorted into the "Variables" tab along with <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-introduction-to-lists/getting-started.html">lists</a>.</div>
                            <img  alt="'make a block' dialog box" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/make-a-block-BYOB.png" >
                		</li>
                   		<li> 
                        	<strong>Title:</strong> Give your block a name. Type "draw square" as shown here.<br />
                    		<img  alt="Make a command block" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/make-draw-square-block.png" >
                    	</li>
                        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Leave "Command" selected since we want to command the computer to draw a square.
                        <div class="comment">Probably should move this as this lab page comes after commands and reporters now...</div>
                        <div class="endnote">
                            You've seen commands before and also reporters, which report information, like this:
                            <p class="center">
                            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/x-position-reporting--79.png" alt="x position reporting -79" title="x position reporting -79" />
                            <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/sqrt-of-25-reporting-5.png" alt="Sqrt of 25 reporting 5" title="Sqrt of 25 reporting 5" />
                            </p>
                            You will learn about other types of blocks, like predicates, <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/4-block-types-calculations/1-commands-and-reporters.html">later</a>.
                        </div>
                        </li>
                        
                  		<li>
                        	In this course, you will almost always want to keep "for all sprites" selected, so you can ignore that choice for now, and click "OK". A dialog titled "Block Editor" will appear.<br />
    					    <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/empty-draw-square-BYOB.png" alt="Block Editor for 'draw square'" >
        					<div class="sidenote">The editor starts you with a <strong>hat</strong> block, a kind of block that is the start for any block you create. It contains the title of your block, <code>draw square</code>, in this case. Hat blocks can never be in the middle of a script, only at the top.</div>
                        </li>
        				<li>
                			<strong>Behavior:</strong> Build the instructions for your new block here exactly as you do in the scripting area:  Drag blocks from the palette to define the script that will run when your custom block is used. <br />
                   			<img class="indent" alt="Script to draw a square" src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/draw-square-no-arguments.png" >
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>When you click "OK", you can use this block exactly the way you have used other blocks. Since you created the block as a "Motion" block, you will find it in the "Motion" tab.</p>
        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pen-down-draw-square.png" alt="pen down, draw square" title="pen down, draw square" />
        <p>Congratulations! You have just created your first custom block.</p>
		
        <div class="takeItFurther">
           <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/house.jpg" alt="House" title="House" />
           <ol start="4">
            	<li>Define <code>draw triangle</code>, a custom block that draws an equilateral triangle with the same sidelength as the square you just drew. </li>
            	<li>Create a script that uses these two blocks (<code>draw square</code> and <code>draw triangle</code>) to draw a "house" shape: a square with a triangular shaped roof sitting on top. Then create a new block <code>draw house</code> that is defined by that script. </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
