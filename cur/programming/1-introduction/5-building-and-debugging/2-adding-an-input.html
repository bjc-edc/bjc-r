		<h2>Adding an Input</h2>
        <div class="sidenote">
        	You've seen many blocks that take an input variable:<br />

        </div>
        <p>You have just created blocks that draw something (a square, a triangle, a house, etc.) of a certain size by giving your block an <em>input</em> that tells your blocks what size image you want to draw.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>To edit a block, right-click (or control-click) on it (either in the palette or in a script) and select "edit" to put it back in the block editor.</p>
                    <img class="indent" title="Editing the 'draw square' block" alt="Editing the 'draw square' block" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/edit-current-block.png" >
                </li>
                <li>   
                    <p>In the "Block Editor," hover your cursor over the words and plus signs (<b>+</b>) in the hat block.</p>
                    <p>Clicking on a word will let you change that word; clicking on a <b>+</b> will let you add something in that position. You want to add an input after the title, so click on the <b>+</b> at the end.</p>
                    <img class="indent" alt="draw square editor" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/draw-square-block-editor.png" >
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>You should get the following dialog box.</p><div class="sidenote">
            <div>Another common word for <em>input</em> in mathematics and computer science is <em>argument</em>. </div>
        </div>

                    <p>You have two choices about what you want to add or modify to the block definition: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>"Title text" (unselected in the picture above) will let you add a word or words to the block's title. For example, if you wanted to change the name of the block from <code>draw square</code> to <code>draw square picture</code> you'd click on "Title text" and type the word "picture" into the text box.</li>
                        <li>"Input name" (selected in the picture above) will let you add an <i>input</i>. This is what you want now, and is selected by default any time you open this dialog.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Give the input a name that makes its meaning clear to any reader: <code>size</code> or <code>sideLength</code> would be good.  Type that name in the input field and click "OK."</p>
                </li></ol></div>
                <div>
                Your block title has changed: there is now a variable named <code>size</code> at the end of the title.<br />
                    <img class="indent" title="New variable in the 'draw square' block" alt="New variable in the 'draw square' block" src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/draw-square-size-unused-argument.png" >

                <li> <div class="sidenote"> <div>This is exactly what you did when you used the variable in the <code>for</code> block.</div> </div>
            
                    <p>To use the <code>size</code> variable within the <code>draw square</code> block, drag the variable <code>size</code> down into the move block. Whenever you need a new copy of a variable, just drag another down.  </p>

					<p>When you click "OK", you'll see that the <code>draw square</code> block in the scripting area now takes an argument. Run this script with a few different inputs to check that it works.</p>

                </li>
                <li>Now edit your <code>triangle</code> and <code>house</code> blocks so that you can draw houses of any size you specify as input.
            
            	<li>Create a <code>draw polygon</code> block that takes two inputs:

                <ul>
                    <li>a number of sides and</li>

  				<p> In the block, call these inputs <code>sides</code> and <code>length</code>. </p>
      	  		<p>Be sure to test out your solution with several polygons, with different lengths and number of sides.</p>
               	</li>

Figure out how to create a new procedure <code>nested polygons</code> with two or three levels of nesting, and inputs that tell how many <code>sides</code> and what side <code>length</code> to use. You might want also to add a third input that tells by what factor to reduce the size of the nested polygons so that you can easily experiment with different reductions.

                         <li>Add inputs to your custom blocks to change your steps in interesting ways.</li>
                         <li>We've included several costumes in the project that you should use in new steps&mdash;look at how we used the costumes in the custom blocks we already created.</li>
                         <li>You could import your own sounds if you would like.  Go to the "Sounds" tab above the scripting area and drag a sound from your computer.</li>
                  <li>After you and your pair programmer have worked out some ideas of your own,  look at what other programmers have done and chat.  If you see something nice, spend some time trying to incorporate that design into your program.</li> </ol>
