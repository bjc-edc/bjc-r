    There are two major connection properties: Latency and throughput.<br>
    <h3>Latency</h3>
    Latency is the time it takes to establish a connection. Latency is
    influenced by hardware i.e. which connection device is used (e.g.,
    wireless connections take longer than wired) and also other factors
    such as the length of the route or latency bottlenecks in the route.
    Latencies are easiest measured with the Linux tool <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_%28networking_utility%29">ping</a>.
    Ping takes a hostname or IP address as a parameter and sends a small
    test packet to the node that is echoed by it. Once the echo is
    received time is measured. If the host does not send an echo back in
    a reasonable time, a timeout is signaled indicating the host is
    offline. This is repeated until the user presses CTRL+C. <br>
    <br>
    Under Linux ping is sometimes accessible as <code>/usr/sbin/ping</code>
    and on Mac it's sometimes <code>/sbin/ping</code>.<br>
    <br>
    Go ahead and try:<br>
    <br>
    <code>ping www.berkeley.edu<br>
      ping www.google.com<br>
      ping australia.gov.au </code><br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><span
      style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Ping can also be used on entire
    networks. This is called broadcast ping, whereby all online hosts on
    the Ethernet bus will respond. In order to ping your network you
    need to find out the IP address of your own host and derive the
    network IP. There are several ways to determine your own IP but the
    easiest is way (when you are not behind a router) is to open your
    browser to <span style="font-style: italic;">www.google.com</span>
    and search for "my IP".&nbsp; Then replace the last digits of the IP
    (say XXX.YYY.ZZZ.001) address with 255. So if your IP address is
    192.150.186.72, your replacement would be 192.150.186.255. <br>
    <br>
    Then you execute:<br>
    <br>
    <code>ping -b</code> XXX.YYY.ZZZ.255 <br>
    <br>
    Go ahead and try it! <br>
    <br>
    Note that this may not always work as some networks forbid the
    broadcast ping or are configured differently. Nevertheless, for a
    system administrator it's an easy way to test all the hosts along
    the bus at once. <br>

    <h3><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>Throughput<br>
    </h3>
    <em><strong>Throughput</strong></em> is a term which describes how much data
    is being transferred at a time. You may also be familiar with another term, 
    <em>bandwidth</em>, which means the same thing. It is usually measured in 
    terms of "bps" or bits per second. For example, you may have an internet 
    connection capable of <em>5Mbps</em>. This means, that (in theory!) each 
    second you computer could download 5 megabits of data from another location.
    Of course, in reality, throughput varies widely, and it's quite difficult
    to obtain the maximum speeds of any connection.
    <br /> 
    Throughput is much harder to measure. It also massively depends on
    what other processes (applications) running on your computer take bandwidth,
    as well as any other devices connected through the same Ethernet port or 
    wireless access device. A simple way but not necessarily very accurate way 
    to measure bandwidth is to use a website 
    designed to test your connection. One example is provided by the website
     <a href="http://www.speedtest.net">http://www.speedtest.net</a>.
    Give it a quick try and answer the following questions:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Run the speed test three times. How much did the throughput
        vary?</li>
      <li>Is upload speed different than download speed? If so, why?</li>
      <li>Synchronize with your peers and measure the speed
        concurrently. How much did it drop?</li>
    </ol>
