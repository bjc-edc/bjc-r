        <p>
Two labs ago, you saw a few different approaches to the important
problem of searching: given a list of numbers, how would you find a
certain number that you are interested in? A lot of people are
interested in this problem; a lot of companies have people whose jobs
are to sift through data and create algorithms to grab information
sought by users as quickly as possible. For example, Google has an
entire building (or twenty) of people dedicated to arranging the vast
amount of information available on the Internet in various interesting
ways, solely so that the search engine can return answers quickly. (In
a future lab, you will be implementing a very basic search engine.)
Microsoft and Apple create software that organizes the files on a
computer in a certain way, so as to make it easier for the computer to
quickly find files the user may need or use. </p>

The very first algorithm that we saw for searching was the "walking"
approach: we "walk" through the list until we find the number that we
want. What kind of runtime would this algorithm have, in the
worst-case: would it be constant, linear, or neither? This question may
help: if you were having a particularly bad day and the number you
wanted was always at the end of the list, how long would it take to
find the number if, say, the list was 20 elements long? 200 elements
long? 2000 elements long? </p>

Not quite: the time it takes to search a list scales as the size of the
list. This is because the more the numbers in a list, the more the
numbers you will have to look at in order to find the number you are
interested in. </div>

            <div class="choice" identifier="c2">
                <div class="text">

Exactly! The time it takes to search a list scales as the size of the
list. This is because the more the numbers in a list, the more the
numbers you will have to look at in order to find the number you are
interested in. </div>
