            The word "algorithm" is arguably one of the nerdiest words ever emitted from a human mouth.  Fortunately for us, the meaning is far easier to understand than you would first think -- an algorithm is simply a set of steps that allow us to solve a particular problem.  In fact, many other careers use algorithms, but have different names for them.

                <strong>Salesman</strong> often have <em>scripts</em> to follow when making a sales call.  The scripts describe how to open the conversation (and possibly more) in order to increase the odds of gaining a client.

                <strong>Do-It-Yourself projects</strong> all come with some sort of <em>instructions</em>. <em>Directions</em>, such as those for assembling a piece of furniture or a Lego kit, are algorithms.

            Computer science <em>algorithms</em> are conceptual solutions to a problem (such as sorting a list), whereas the <em>implementation</em> of an algorithm is the actual code that brings the solution to life.  The implementations themselves can typically be written in almost any programming language and run on any computer; the concepts behind the algorithm are not affected by these types of conditions, in the same way that the outcome of a well-written recipe should (hopefully) not be affected by the cook or kitchen.
