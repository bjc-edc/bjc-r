Let's reconsider the problem: if we have this series of cups, what can we do that will make it easier to find a particular number when a user requests it? Brainstorm on some ideas with your group and come up with a plan that could help us do more searching in less time. One person should prepare to present your group's revised idea to the class.   </body></html>
