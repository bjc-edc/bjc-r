        <h2>Planning a Quiz App</h2>
        <div class="endnote">
            <h4>Please note, this is a adaptation of the student-facing page and was designed for use in a brief conference session. The complete student-facing version will be available on <a href="https://bjc.edc.org/" title="bjc.edc.org" target="_blank">bjc.edc.org</a> in the spring.</h4></div>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop a quiz app by creating an <em>abstract data type</em> to pair the questions with their answers.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            You'll use a list to store your quiz items in a variable. You <em>could</em> just <a href="#hint-solidlist" data-toggle="collapse" title="put all the questions and their answers in a list like this">put all the questions and their answers in a list like this</a> and then use <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/item-empty-full-size.png" height="35" alt="item () of 'list input slot'" title="item () of 'list input slot'"> to retrieve each question and each answer using its index.
            <div id="hint-solidlist" class="collapse"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/quiz-questions-list.png" alt="set (computer science quiz) to (list (What is the computer science term for looping or repetition?) (iteration) (What is the name for the abstraction in a program that can hold a value?) (variable) (What kind of variable is available only in the part of the program where it is defined?) (local variable))" title="set (computer science quiz) to (list (What is the computer science term for looping or repetition?)

(local variable))"></div>
            That might be ok for the first quiz item (you could use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/item-1-of-csquiz.png" alt="item (1) of (computer science quiz)" title="item (1) of (computer science quiz)"> to get the first question and <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/item-2-of-csquiz.png" alt="item (2) of (computer science quiz)" title="item (2) of (computer science quiz)"> to get the first answer), but for a long quiz, you might leave out one answer by accident and then after that, the program will get questions and answers mixed up.
        </p>
        <div class="vocab">: <strong>Sublist</strong> 
            <p>A <strong>sublist</strong> is a list as an item of another list.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Instead, <a href="#hint-sublist" data-toggle="collapse" title="you can use a sublist for each question/answer pair">you can use a <em>sublist</em> for each question/answer pair</a>. Then you could choose just one of those lists at a time to work with.

            But with nested lists (lists with sublists) it can be hard to keep track of the input numbers for <code>item of</code>, so <a href="#hint-useabstraction" data-toggle="collapse" title="a better way is to use abstraction to organize the quiz items">a better way is to <em>use abstraction</em> to organize the quiz items</a>.

            This abstraction just hides the <code>list</code> and <code>item of</code> blocks, so it isn't complicated to build, but it can make your code <em>much</em> easier to write, read, and debug.<br />

                    The constructor and selector together make up the <code>quiz item</code> <em>abstract data type</em>. An <strong>abstract data type</strong> (or <strong>ADT</strong>) is a custom data type that's meaningful to your program. It's not built into the language like the blocks that appear in the palettes on the left when you first open Snap<em>!</em>; you develop it as you code.
