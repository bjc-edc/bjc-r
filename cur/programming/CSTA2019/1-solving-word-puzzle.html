        <div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Predicate</strong> and <strong> Boolean</strong>
            <p>A <strong>predicate</strong> is a procedure that asks a true/false question such as <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/a-gt-7.png" alt="a &gt; 7" title="a &gt; 7" />. Predicates report a <strong>Boolean</strong> value (either <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true" title="true" /> or <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false" title="false" />). </p>
            <p>Predicates fit into a hexagonal input slots of conditionals, such as in  <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if-full-size.png" alt="if block" title="if block" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat-until.png" alt="repeat until" title="repeat until" />. Predicates can help your program <em>decide when to do something</em>.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Predicates can also be used with <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep-new.png" alt="keep items () from 'list input slot'" title="keep items () from 'list input slot'" /> to <em>decide which things to keep</em>. The <code>keep</code> block takes a list and a predicate as input, and it reports a new list keeping only the items from the list that make the predicate true. For example, this expression finds words from the <var>words list</var> whose first letter is v and reports a list of 170 matching words. The <em>blank input slot</em> is where each word in the list goes to decide if it will be kept.<br>

            <h4><strong>Essential Idea</strong></h4>
            <p>You write the predicate that does the checking, and <code>keep</code> applies that predicate to each item in the input list and then reports a new list of only the items that make your predicate <code>true</code>.</p>
			<p>Note that the blank input slot in the predicate is <em>required</em> when using <code>keep</code>. This is where the item from the list goes each time the question (predicate) is asked.</p>
