		<h2>Finishing Your First Snap<em>!</em> App</h2>
        <p><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /></p>

		<p>More than one script can control a sprite. You currently have just one script, which runs <em>when Alonzo is clicked</em>. Now you'll make a second script that runs <em>when <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button"/> is clicked</em>. The new script will get Alonzo to welcome the player to your game.</p>
        <div class="takeNote">
      
            <p>Blocks that look like this <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/1-introduction/1-YEAR-3-PG-VERSION-introduction/1-building-an-app/Hat-block.png" alt="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When" /> can be used to detect an <em>event</em>—clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, clicking the <em><img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button"/></em>—and tell a script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap<em>!</em> programmers call them &quot;hat blocks.&quot; </p>
            <p>You can stop all running scripts by clicking the red stop sign <img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="stop button"/> at the top right of your screen.</p>

                <li>Open your ClickAlonzo project in the window below.</li>
                <li>Create a second script that makes Alonzo move to (190, -130) and <code>say</code> a welcome message whenever the green flag is clicked. (Alonzo might say, "Welcome to 'Click On Alonzo!' Keep clicking me if you can!") . </li>
			    <li>
                	Make that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo.
                	  <div class="endnote">The <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-empty.png" alt="say ()" title="say ()" /> block with an empty input will make the  sprite  say nothing.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                	Check that your app does everything you want:
                	  <ul>
                    	<li>When the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should move to (190, -130) and say its message.</li>
                        <li>When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage and face the other way.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    So far, Alonzo waits in one place to be clicked. Increase the challenge by adding code so that after the first  click and from them on, Alonzo moves to a random position on the stage every two seconds (even if not clicked).

                        <li>Put another block in your program to change the ghost effect by -5 any time Alonzo moves without being clicked. </li>

                                <li>Piazza Feedback 9/15/15: [Take it further B] is problematic.  When a student drops a reset button into the costumes, suddenly the "next costume" code s/he has already programmed will turn Alonzo into a reset button and then later back to left and right Alonzo's again.  The lab is not clear to a novice that the costume belongs to a different/new sprite because creating new sprites has not been covered yet.  We had churned through all this in the old labs and figured out what the students were going to run into.  Now with new labs we have to start all over again and I am hesitant to let them proceed if it means having to devote class time to a few leaders while others are still struggling to get started.</li>
                                <li>GH Feedback 9/1/15: The reset button doesn't seem to work without using broadcast - it seems like the clear graphic effects and set ghost effect blocks are sprite specific. None of my students were able to get a reset block to work.<ul><li>BH: Either we teach them broadcast (or TELL) or we flush the example.</li></ul></li>

                          Add a reset button by <strong>creating a sprite </strong>(see sidenote) with a reset button costume (made in Snap<em>!</em> or using an imported image) that will <code>clear graphic effects</code> or <code>set ghost effect to 0</code> when clicked.</li>  -->
