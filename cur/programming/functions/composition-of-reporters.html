        <p>
            Consider the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/max-3-arg.png"> block definition below:
        </p>
        
			<img class="center" alt="Script for 'max' with three arguments" src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/max-3-arg-code.png">
            
		<p>
            Using similar methodology your challenge is to make the following blocks work by composing several functions together
            (and then maybe a little extra work):
        </p>
		<ol>
			<li>
                <p>
                    A three-input addition operator that accepts only numbers.
                </p>
					<img class="center" alt="Three-argument addition operator" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/3-arg-addition-block-BYOB.gif">
			</li>
			<li>
                <p>
                    A reporter block named "sum of two smallest" that takes three numbers as inputs, and reports the sum of the two smallest (the example shown below would report 9):
                </p>
					<img class="center" alt="sum of two smallest block" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/sum-of-two-smallest.png">
			</li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A predicate block named "Are any equal?" that compares
                    3 numbers and returns true if any two are equal to each other (the example shown below would return true):
                </p>
                    <img class="center" alt="Are any equal? predicate block" src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/composition-are-any-equal.png">
            </li>
		</ol>
