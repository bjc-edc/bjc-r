            Simplifying a tic-tac-toe board drawer using custom blocks

        <p>
            In a previous lab, we used a <code>repeat</code> block to avoid
            duplicating code.  Similarly, we can use a custom block to
            avoid duplicating code.
            Below is some code to draw a tic-tac-toe board.
            Your goal is to create blocks that make this code simpler.

        <p>Some things to remember:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>As a first step, break up this
                drawing task into meaningful sub-tasks.  We suggest doing this
                working with pen and paper, not while looking at the code!
                </li>
            <li>
                Give your new blocks
                appropriate names.  You want to make it easy to read the
                code&mdash;at its best, like natural, english sentences&mdash;
                and understand what it does.
            </li>
            <li>
                It may make sense to "split" some blocks up into different
                custom blocks.  For instance, a single
                <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-left-180.png" alt="turn left 180 degrees" />
                might be better performed as a
                <img  class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-left-90.png" alt="turn left 90 degrees" />
                in one custom block followed by a
                <img  class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-left-90.png" alt="turn left 90 degrees" />
                in another.

            </li>
        </ul>
