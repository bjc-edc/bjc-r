			We want to make our own <em>predicate</em>, a kind of block that reports either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. We have a "greater than" operator (<code>&gt;</code>), an "equal" operator (<code>=</code>), and a "less than" operator (<code>&lt;</code>), but we want a new "greater than or equal to" (<code>&gt;=</code>) operator.

			This isn't really a hard problem, but we've learned from experience that many students have a hard time with it at first. So here are some suggestions if you get stuck.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Make sure that you choose the hexagonal <code>
					predicate</code>
				block shape in the initial <code>
					Make a block</code>
				dialog.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				This is an <em>infix</em> operator, i.e., the
				<code>
					&gt;=
				</code>
				block name goes between the two input slots. So you'll have to use the left plus sign in the Block Editor.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				You'll probably find the Boolean operators helpful, although they're not entirely necessary:
				<br>
				<br>
				<img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/Booleans.png" alt="and, or, not blocks">
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				There are several correct ways to do this! It's okay if your answer is different from another group's answer, as long as it gives the right <code>
					true</code>
				and <code>
					false</code>
				answers.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			If you <em>do</em> have trouble with this problem, don't feel bad, but try to understand what's getting in the way, and when you see a solution, learn from it!
