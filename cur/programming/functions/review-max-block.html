            We are going to look more closely at the custom <code>max</code> block.

            Recall, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/max.png">
            takes two numbers as input and reports the bigger value (the maximum).
        </p>

        <p>
            Mark Zuckerberg shows you his version of <code>max</code> that doesn't seem

        </p>

        <div class="indent">
            <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/building-blocks/max-buggy.xml"> <img src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/max-code-buggy.png" alt="Buggy max code"> </a>
        </div>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Try to predict what this <code>max</code> block reports for various input values.  
                If you need extra help click on the picture above to go to a <span class="snap">snap</span> file containing the code.
            </li>

            <br>
            <li>
                With a fellow student, describe how to fix the faulty <code>max</code> block.  
                What confusion did Mr. Zuckerberg seem to have?
            </li>
