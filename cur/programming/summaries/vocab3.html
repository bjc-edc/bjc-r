            <div class="comment">AAP-3.B.1, AAP-3.B.5</div>
            <p>As you learned in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/2-gossip.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 1 Lab 2 Page 2: Making Programs Talk">Unit 1 Lab 2 Page 2: Making Programs Talk</a>, <strong>procedural abstraction</strong> is the process of developing a program by breaking up a large problem into smaller sub-problems.</p>
            <p>Creating a <code>draw brick</code> block lets you think in terms of a procedure with a name related to the problem you are solving. This makes your code easier to read, and once you've coded and debugged the block, you don't need to think about how it works each time you use it. That's the beauty of procedural abstraction.</p>

            <p>A <strong>clone</strong> is a copy of a sprite that <em>shares information</em> with its parent sprite (the original sprite). For example, clones have copies of any scripts from the parent, and if the parent's script is changed, then the clones' scripts change too. However, changes you make to a clone are <em>not</em> shared with the parent, so you can do things like move each clone to a different position.</p>

                            <p>We use "input" loosely to mean the empty boxes in a block that get filled with values.  But <strong>input</strong> also means information entered into a program by the user, as in the <code>ask and wait</code> block.  Program input can also come from data tables, sounds, pictures, video, or other programs.</p>
                            <p>Similarly, program <strong>output</strong> means any data sent from your program to the user or to any device.  Typically, the output depends on the input.</p>

            <p>On page 2 of this lab, you built code to add a contact to your app. On this page, you built code to find contacts. This process of breaking a programming project up into separate sub-problems is called <strong>modularity</strong>.</p>

                <p>A <strong>higher order function</strong> is a function that takes a function as input (or reports a function as output). </p>

            <p>A <strong>sprite variable</strong> is like a global variable in that it <em>doesn't</em> belong to a particular <em>script</em>, but it does belong to a particular <em>sprite.</em></p>
