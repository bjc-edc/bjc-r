                    The <strong>Internet</strong> is a <em>computer network</em> that uses open protocols to standardize communication. A <em>computing device</em> connected to an Internet-connected device is required to access the Internet.

                        <li>A <strong>computer <em>network</em></strong> is an interconnected <em>computing system</em> that is capable of sending or receiving data.</li>
                        <li>A <strong>computing <em>system</em></strong> is a group of <em>computing devices</em> and programs working together for a common purpose.</li>
                        <li>A <strong>computing <em>device</em></strong> is a physical object that can run a program, such as computers, tablets, cell phones, and smart sensors. </li>

                <li>A <strong>router</strong> is a computer that passes information from one network to another.</li>
                <p>Your computer probably uses a router that is somewhere in your home to connect to your <em>ISP</em>.</p>
                <li><strong>ISPs</strong> (Internet Service Providers) are the companies who sell Internet access to homes and institutions.</li>
                <p>The computers connected to the Internet and the connections among them don't belong to any one organization. Different ISPs provide the Internet to different communities. And typically within a large organization (such as a university), the Internet connections are provided by the organization itself. </p>

                <li><strong>Bandwidth</strong> is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time (for digital data, it is measured in bits per second). Higher bandwidth is better because the data will travel more quickly.</li>
                <li>Storing data in <strong>the cloud</strong> means storing it <em>somewhere</em> on the Internet, but you don't know where. The cloud service provider (Google, Dropbox, Amazon,  Snap<em>!</em>, etc.) manages the actual storage location.</li>

                <strong>TCP/IP</strong> is a pair of protocols that provide two levels of abstraction: 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IP</strong> (Internet Protocol) lets your computer pretend it has a <em>direct</em> connection to another computer. The routers at every connection point on the Internet run IP, which transmits packets from one IP address to another.</li>
                    <li><strong>TCP</strong> (Transmission Control Protocol) lets your computer pretend it has a <em>reliable</em> connection to the other computer. The computers (including servers) at the two endpoints of a communication run TCP, which guarantees that packets arrive successfully.</li>

            <p><strong>Public key encryption</strong> uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The sender uses the public key to encrypt the message, and receiver uses their private key to decrypt it. </p>
