                    The <strong>Internet</strong> is a <em>computer network</em> that uses open protocols to standardize communication. A <em>computing device</em> connected to an Internet-connected device is required to access the Internet.

                <p>The computers connected to the Internet and the connections among them don't belong to any one organization. Different ISPs provide the Internet to different communities. And typically within a large organization (such as a university), the Internet connections are provided by the organization itself. </p>

                <strong>TCP/IP</strong> is a pair of protocols that provide two levels of abstraction:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IP</strong> (Internet Protocol) lets your computer pretend it has a <em>direct</em> connection to another computer. The routers at every connection point on the Internet run IP, which transmits packets from one IP address to another.</li>
