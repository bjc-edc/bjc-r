<h2>Unit 6: How Computers Work</h2>
<h3>Lab 1: Computer Abstraction Hierarchy</h3>
<div class="vocabSummary" ><strong> <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/1-abstraction/01-abstraction.html?topic=nyc_bjc/6-how-computers-work.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/1-abstraction/01-abstraction.html">6.1.1</a></strong>: <strong>analog</strong> vs. <strong>digital</strong>
<a name="box1" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
        	<p>Digital and analog are opposites. <strong>Digital</strong> means information that is represented as <em>ones and zeros</em>. <strong>Analog</strong> means information that is represented by signals that <em>vary continuously</em> (that is, including in-between values).</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>software library</strong> is a package of procedures that you can import into your program. A library is a kind of abstraction: you don't have to know any of the details of how it's coded. You can build libraries yourself, or you can use one that someone else wrote.</li>
                <!--<div class="ap-standard">AAP-3.D.4, AAP-3.D.5</div>
                <li>An <strong>application program interface (API)</strong> documents what the user of a library needs to know about it: it's a description of each procedure's purpose, inputs, and outputs (but not its algorithms).</li>-->
            </ul>

<div class="vocabSummary" ><strong> <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/1-abstraction/06-digital-architecture.html?topic=nyc_bjc/6-how-computers-work.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/1-abstraction/06-digital-architecture.html">6.1.6</a></strong>
<a name="box3" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
			<p><strong>Machine language</strong> is the lowest-level programming language; it is directly understood by the computer hardware.</p>
            <p><strong>Architecture</strong> is an abstraction, a specification of the machine language. It also tells how the processor connects to the memory. It doesn't specify the circuitry; the same architecture can be built as circuitry in many different ways.</p>

<div class="vocabSummary" ><strong> <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/1-abstraction/08-digital-IC.html?topic=nyc_bjc/6-how-computers-work.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/1-abstraction/08-digital-IC.html">6.1.8</a></strong>
<a name="box4" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
        	<p>An <strong>integrated circuit</strong> ("IC" or "chip") is a single physical device that contains millions or billions of basic electrical parts. A processor is an IC, but not all ICs are processors; there are also special-purpose chips inside a computer.</p>

<h3>Lab 2: History of Computers</h3>
<div class="vocabSummary" ><strong> <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/2-history-impact/2-moore.html?topic=nyc_bjc/6-how-computers-work.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/2-history-impact/2-moore.html">6.2.2</a></strong>
<a name="box5" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
			<p><strong>Moore's Law</strong> is the prediction that the number of transistors that fit on one chip doubles every year.</p>
