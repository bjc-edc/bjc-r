<h2>Unit 6: How Computers Work</h2>
<div class="vocab100Width" ><strong> <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/1-abstraction/01-abstraction.html" title="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/1-abstraction/01-abstraction.html">6.1.01</a></strong>: <strong>analog</strong> vs. <strong>digital</strong>
        	<p>Digital and analog are opposites. <strong>Digital</strong> means information that is represented as <em>ones and zeros</em>. <strong>Analog</strong> means information that is represented by signals that <em>vary continuously</em> (that is, including in-between values).</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>software library</strong> is a package of procedures that you can import into your program. A library is a kind of abstraction: you don't have to know any of the details of how it's coded. You can build libraries yourself, or you can use one that someone else wrote.</li>
                <!--<div class="comment">AAP-3.D.4, AAP-3.D.5</div>
                <li>An <strong>application program interface (API)</strong> documents what the user of a library needs to know about it: it's a description of each procedure's purpose, inputs, and outputs (but not its algorithms).</li>-->

			<p><strong>Machine language</strong> is the lowest-level programming language; it is directly understood by the computer hardware.</p>
            <p><strong>Architecture</strong> is an abstraction, a specification of the machine language. It also tells how the processor connects to the memory. It doesn't specify the circuitry; the same architecture can be built as circuitry in many different ways.</p>

        	<p>An <strong>integrated circuit</strong> ("IC" or "chip") is a single physical device that contains millions or billions of basic electrical parts. A processor is an IC, but not all processors are IC; there are also special-purpose chips inside a computer.</p>
