<h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Programming</h2>
<h3>Lab 1: Click Alonzo Game</h3>
<div class="vocab100Width" ><strong> <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/4-keeping-score.html" title="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/4-keeping-score.html">1.1.4</a></strong><strong>: Sprites and Costumes</strong>
            <p>The Alonzo character is named after Alonzo Church, a major contributor to early computer science. In this project, there are three objects related to Alonzo:
                <ul>
                    <li>One is a <em><strong>sprite</strong></em>, which is like an actor on the stage who knows how to do many different things, such as walk around the stage and speak the lines of the play.</li>
                    <li>The other two are <em><strong>costumes</strong></em>,  picture that can be &quot;worn&quot; by a sprite.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
<div class="vocab100Width" ><strong> <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/4-keeping-score.html" title="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/4-keeping-score.html">1.1.4</a></strong>
            <p>
                The <strong>transparency</strong> of an image is how much you can see what's behind it. For example, here is the Alonzo sprite shown with three different transparencies (which have been set using the <code>ghost effect</code> block).<br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/transparency2.png" title="three pictures of Alonzo, with ghost effect 0%, 25%, and 50%, on a background of a brick wall" alt="three pictures of Alonzo, with ghost effect 0%, 25%, and 50%, on a background of a brick wall" />

<h3>Lab 2: Gossip</h3>
<div class="vocab100Width" ><strong> <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/3-customizing.html" title="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/3-customizing.html">1.2.3</a></strong>: <strong>Lists</strong>, <strong>Strings</strong>, and <strong>Concatenation</strong>
            <ul> 
                <div class="comment">AAP-1.C.1 first sentence</div>
                <li>
                    A <strong>list</strong> is an ordered set of items. You've seen this example:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/list-from-who.png" alt="list{Senora, Ms. C, my cat, Hannah, Jake}" title="list{Senora, Ms. C, my cat, Hannah, Jake}" />
                </li>
                <div class="comment">AAP-2.D.1, AAP-2.D.2</div>
                <li>The items of this list are <em>strings</em>. A <strong>string</strong> is a sequence of characters (letters, digits, punctuation, etc.). A <strong>substring</strong> is just a piece of some existing string. For example, "Hanna," "anna", and "nnah" are each substrings of the string "Hannah." (The empty string as well as the original string are both also substrings.)</li>
                <li>To <strong>concatenate</strong> strings means to make a bigger string by connecting two or more smaller strings. In Snap<em>!</em>, the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join()().png" alt="join () ()" title="join () ()" /> block lets you concatenate strings.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

                    <p>This process of testing, finding problems, and fixing them is called <strong>debugging</strong>.</p>

            <div class="comment">AAP-3.A.1, AAP-3.A.2</div>
            <p>
                A <strong>procedure</strong> is a named sequence of instructions that may take inputs and may report a value. Some languages call procedures <em>methods</em> or <em>functions</em>. Here are two types of procedures you have seen in Snap<em>!</em>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reporters</strong> have an oval shape. They <em>report a value</em>.<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-full-size.png" alt="pick random () to ()" title="pick random () to ()" />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/list-full-size.png" alt="list ()" title="list ()">
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/plus.png" alt="() + ()" title="() + ()" />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Commands</strong> have a jigsaw puzzle shape. They <em>tell the computer to do something</em> without reporting a value.<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/broadcast.png" alt="broadcast ()" title="broadcast ()" />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/point-in-direction-blank.png" alt="point in direction ()" title="point in direction ()" />

            <div class="comment">AAP-2.B.3, AAP-2.B.4</div>
            <ul>
                <li>An <strong>expression</strong> is a either a constant value (such as "4" or "winter") or a call to a reporter block with any input slots filled in (such as <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/number.png" alt="number" title="number" />, <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/5+(4x3).png" alt="5 + (4 * 3)" title="5 + (4 * 3)" />, or <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/join-who-doeswhat-who.png" alt="join (who) ( ) (does what) ( ) (who)" title="join (who) ( ) (does what) ( ) (who)" />).</li>
                <li>Expressions are evaluated to produce a <em>single</em> <strong>value</strong> (a value can be a number, a string, a sprite, a costume, a script, a list&mdash;anything). For example, <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/5+(4x3).png" alt="5 + (4 * 3)" title="5 + (4 * 3)" /> will be evaluated to 17.</li>

<h3>Lab 3: Modern Art with Polygons</h3>
<div class="vocab100Width"  AP-only"><strong> <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/1-exploring-motion.html" title="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/1-exploring-motion.html">1.3.1</a></strong><strong>: Algorithm</strong> and <strong>Pseudocode</strong>
            <div class="comment">AAP-2.A.1, AAP-2.A.2, AAP-2.A.3</div>
            <p>An <strong>algorithm</strong> is a sequence of steps that are usually performed by a computer. The algorithm doesn't have to be written in any particular programming language or even in a programming language at all; you can write your algorithm in English or any other human language. Some people call an algorithm written in human language <strong>pseudocode</strong>. Once you know the steps that the computer will take, you can code your algorithm in the programming language of your choice.</p>
            <div class="endnote">What's the purpose of "pseudocode"? Why write an algorithm vaguely in English when you could write it precisely in Snap<em>!</em>? If you were programming in a punctuation-heavy language, designing your program in pseudocode would help you focus on the important ideas instead of on details like quotation marks and semicolons. But pseudocode isn't as necessary with a language like Snap<em>!</em>, and pseudocode can make it easy for you to fall into wishful thinking about what the computer is capable of (such as writing "Pick tomorrow's winning lottery numbers" or "Here's the melody; write the harmony").</div>

            <div class="comment">AAP-3.A.3</div>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A <strong>parameter</strong> (or <em>formal parameter</em>) is the input <em>name,</em> such as <var>number of branches</var>. The input name is set in the block definition. It never changes.<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/example-parameter.png" alt="image of complete pinwheel, branches:(number of branches) block definition with parameter label pointing to number of branches" title="image of complete pinwheel, branches:(number of branches) block definition with parameter label pointing to number of branches" />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An <strong>argument</strong> (or <em>actual argument</em>) is the input <em>value,</em> such as 6 for a hexagonal pinwheel. The input value is given each time the block is run; it can be a different value each time.<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/example-argument.png" alt="pinwheel, branches: (6) with argument label pointing to the input 6" title="pinwheel, branches: (6) with argument label pointing to the input 6" />
                    </li>
                </ul>
                We use the word "input" both for parameters (input names) and for arguments (input values).

            <div class="comment">AAP-2.J.1</div>
            <p>Computer scientists describe a repeating program structure as <em>looping</em>, <em>repetition</em>, or <strong>iteration</strong>.</p>
            <div class="comment">AAP-2.K.1</div>
            <p>
                The code can be repeated <code>forever</code>, a specific number of times (such as when using <code>repeat</code>), or until something specific happens (such as when using <code>repeat until</code> as you'll see in Lab 5). <br />
