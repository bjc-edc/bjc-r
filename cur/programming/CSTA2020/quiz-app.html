            You'll use a list to store your quiz items in a variable.

            That might be ok for the first quiz item (you could use <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/item-1-of-csquiz.png" alt="item (1) of (computer science quiz)" title="item (1) of (computer science quiz)"> to get the first question and <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/item-2-of-csquiz.png" alt="item (2) of (computer science quiz)" title="item (2) of (computer science quiz)"> to get the first answer), but for a long quiz, you might leave out one answer by accident and then after that, the program will get questions and answers mixed up.

            This abstraction just hides the <code>list</code> and <code>item of</code> blocks, so it isn't complicated to build, but it can make your code <em>much</em> easier to write, read, and debug.<br />

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A <strong>data type</strong> is what kind of data something is (number, text string, list, etc.). For example, <em>number</em> is the data type for the first input to <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/item.png" height="35" alt="item (1) of ()" title="item (1) of ()"> and <em>list</em> is the the data type for its second input.

                    Each programming language provides some <strong>primitive data types</strong> (data types that are built-in). For example, Snap<em>!</em> provides numbers, text (words and sentences), Booleans (true or false), lists, and some you haven't yet used as data (such as sprites and costumes). <a href="#hint-primitive" data-toggle="collapse" title="This menu shows all of Snap!'s primitive types.">This menu shows all of Snap<em>!</em>'s primitive types.</a>

                    An <strong>abstract data type</strong> (or <strong>ADT</strong>) is a custom data type that's meaningful to your program. It's not built into the language; you develop it as you code. This is an abstraction because it hides the details inside the constructor and selectors so that the programmer who uses a <code>quiz item</code> has to think only about questions and answers, not about list indices.

                    <p>The word "abstract" is often used casually to mean something <em>harder</em> to understand or more complex, but in computer science, its meaning is almost the opposite.

                    <p>Your selectors expect a quiz item, i.e., a list, as input.  You can make your blocks <em>show</em> what type of data they expect. It's not necessary in Snap<em>!</em> but, like assigning a color to a block, it can be a helpful reminder of what the block does and what type of input it expects. You've already seen input slots of several shapes, indicating different expected data types. </p>

            <div><span>Alphie:</span> We can use our <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/question-selector.png" alt="question from quiz item: ()" title="question from quiz item: ()"/> and <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/answer-selector.png" alt="answer from quiz item: ()" title="answer from quiz item: ()"/> selectors to get the question and answer for quiz item in our list. But how do we get the quiz item <em>out</em> of the list in the first place?</div>
            <div>
                <span>Gamal:</span> Maybe we can use <code>item of</code> inside a <code>for</code> loop and use the index from the <code>for</code> loop as the first input to <code>item of</code>, like this:<br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/for-with-item-of.png" alt="for (i) = (1) to (4) {
    ask (question from (item (i) of (computer science quiz))) and wait
}" title="for (i) = (1) to (4) {
    ask (question from (item (i) of (computer science quiz))) and wait
}" />
            </div>
            <div class="vocabFullWidth">
                <p>Using the result from <code>item</code> as the input to <code>address from contact</code> is called <strong>composition</strong> of functions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <span>Betsy:</span> Yeah, we could, but that's a little hard to read with that index variable to keep track of, and if we add more questions, we'll have to update the number 4 that tells us when to end the loop. I bet we can use <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/for-each-(item)-of().png" height="68" alt="for each (item) of 'list input slot' {}" title="for each (item) of 'list input slot' {}"> to <em>traverse</em> the list. We could even rename <var>item</var> something logical like <var>quiz item</var>. Then the code inside will run once for each quiz item in our list.
            </div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> And the code will be more readable when we want to do something like asking the question or checking the answer from a pair!</div>

            <div class="comment">AAP-2.O.2</div>
            <p><strong>Traversing</strong> a list means looking at each item of the list. <code>For each</code> is iterative (that is, it's repetitive, like <code>for</code>, which can also traverse a list). But unlike <code>for</code>, <code>for each</code> traverses the list <em>without using index numbers</em>.</p>

                    Users might answer questions that are close enough but not exactly the answer you expected. For example, someone might answer "What kind of variable is available only in the part of the program where it is defined?" with "a local variable," "local variable," or just "local," or the same possibilities for "script variable." So your <code>question answer</code> ADT could take a <em>list</em> of keywords in the second slot and accept any answer that includes any of the keywords (so in this case, the list would be {local, script} and would accept "a local one"). Use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/contains-empty.png" alt="() contains ()" title="() contains ()" /> to adapt your code.
