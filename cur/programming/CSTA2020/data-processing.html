            You may be familiar with tables from spreadsheet applications (such as Google Sheets, Apple Numbers, or Microsoft Excel) which store tabular data in different file formats. Spreadsheet programs help efficiently organize information, and they can find trends in data automatically (such as the line shown at right). CSV is an open spreadsheet format that works in any of these applications and in Snap<em>!</em>.

                CSV stands for "comma separated values." CSV files are tables of data stored with commas between each item in a row and line breaks between each row in the table. (You can see the commas and line breaks of a CSV by opening it in a text editor.)

        <div class="comment">DAT-2.C.3, DAT-2.C.2 all bullets</div>
        <p>Researchers often face challenges with data before they even begin analysis. Suppose you are combining data from different countries about distances between cities, and you discover that the distance data from the U.S. is measured in miles, but the distance data from Europe is measured in kilometers; to make meaningful comparisons, you need <em>uniform</em> data (all in miles or all in kilometers). As another example, if you use an online survey to collect data, the way participants abbreviate, spell, or capitalize their entries may vary. Data may also be incomplete (if some people didn't complete the survey) or invalid (if some people made mistakes).</p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
            <div class="comment">DAT-2.C.4, DAT-2.E.2</div>
            <p><strong>Cleaning data</strong> is the process of making the data uniform <em>without changing its meaning</em> (such as replacing abbreviations, spellings, and capitalizations with the intended word or converting miles to kilometers). Programmers can use programs to filter and clean digital data, thereby gaining insight and knowledge.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="comment">DAT-2.C.5</div>
        <p>Imagine you read in the news that people who eat a lot of broccoli are less likely to get cancer. The conclusion that broccoli prevents cancer could be a result of <em>bias</em>. It could be that people who eat a lot of broccoli tend to be the same people who also get a lot of exercise, and it's actually the exercise that makes the difference. In research, the term "bias" doesn't have to mean prejudice; it's about reasons the data might not mean what they seem to mean.</p>
        <p>People sometimes think that the way to overcome bias is to use a bigger sample (asking more people if they eat broccoli and have cancer). But if the bigger sample has the same problem (people getting more exercise also eat more broccoli), then a bigger sample won't eliminate the bias.</p>

        <h2>Analyzing Data</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will ask and answer more demanding questions about your dataset and learn new tools.</p>

            <div class="comment">DAT-2.D.4</div>
            You can ask questions about a specific subset of your data by <em>filtering</em> the data using <code>keep</code>. Filtering is a powerful technique for finding information and recognizing patterns in data. For example, filtering can help you answer questions like "What is the average city MPG <em>for just the Subarus</em> in this dataset?"<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/average-mpg-of-subarus-reporting.png" alt="average of (column (9) of table (keep items (field (14) of record 'empty list input slot' = Subaru) from (data of table (cars))) reporting 19.49..." title="average of (column (9) of table (keep items (field (14) of record 'empty list input slot' = Subaru) from (data of table (cars))) reporting 19.49..." /><br />
            Column 14 is the "Make" of the vehicle, so we <code>keep</code> all the records from <var>cars</var> for which the 14<sup>th</sup> field is "Subaru." Then, we take column 9 of those records (the "City MPG") and find their average.
        </p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p>Notice that there are many digits in the answer above.  How many digits are given in the table for each car's MPG?  An important rule in data science is not to claim more precision in a result than is warranted by the given data, so this answer should be rounded to 19.</p>
            <p>You might find expressions with many nested function calls easier to build by using the <code>pipe</code> function. <a href="#hint-pipe" data-toggle="collapse" title="What would this look like using pipe?">What would this look like using <code>pipe</code>?</a>
                <div id="hint-pipe" class="collapse">
                    <p>
                        You can use the <code>pipe</code> function from the "Bar Charts" library to work through your data analysis one function at at time:<br />
                       <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/pipe-cars-reporting.png" alt="pipe (data of table (cars)) → (keep items (field (14) of record 'list input slot' = Subaru) from 'list input slot') (column (9) of table ()) (average of ()) reporting 19.49..." title="pipe (data of table (cars)) → (keep items (field (14) of record 'list input slot' = Subaru) from 'list input slot') (column (9) of table ()) (average of ()) reporting 19.49..." /><br />
                        The <code>pipe</code> function sends the <code>data from table (</code><var>cars</var><code>)</code> through <code>keep</code> to filter it for just the Subarus, through <code>column (9) of table</code> to get just the "City MPG" for those Subarus, and finally through <code>average</code> to get the average of those Subaru MPG values.  
                    </p>
                    <p>Recall that the empty input slots in each function are filled by the output of the previous function (or the starting dataset in the case of the first function): the empty slots in the <code>keep</code> function are both filled by <code>data from table (</code><var>cars</var><code>)</code>; the empty slot in <code>column (9) of table</code> is filled by the output of <code>keep</code>; and the empty slot in <code>average</code> is filled by the output of <code>column (9) of table</code>. It's like a pipe of made of pieces connected together; the data goes in one end and works through each function, computing a new value at each step.</p>

            Sometimes, you want to keep a subset of your data (such as "Which cars were made in 2010?"), but other times, you just want one item that matches your requirement, often because what you really want to know is whether <em>any</em> items match, and as soon as you find one, the answer is &quot;yes&quot; (such as "Were any electric cars made in 2010?"). Snap<em>!</em> has a higher order function <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/find-first.png" alt="find first item () in 'list input slot'" title="find first item () in 'list input slot'" /> that works similarly to <code>keep</code>, but it reports only the first item that's found, so it can be faster.

            The <code>bar chart</code> function works like the <code>group</code> function, but with special features for numeric data: it allows you to select upper and lower limits of the data; you can have a range of values in one bucket, such as values 6&ndash;10, values 11&ndash;15, and so on; and it sorts the groups. For example, here is the <var>cars</var> data grouped by city MPG (column 9):<br />

                <li>As before, Column B shows the total number of vehicles within each MPG range (0&ndash;5, 6&ndash;10, 11&ndash;15, etc.)</li>
                <li>As before, Column C contains a list of all the data from cars within that MPG range (such as all the data for the 879 cars that get between 21 and 25 MPG in the city).</li>
