<h2>Subsets</h2>
Given a set of things, a <em>subset </em> contains zero or more of its elements, without duplicates. Like ice cream bowls, order doesn't matter.

<p><div class="sidenote">{Banana, Apple} does <strong>not</strong> count as a different subset from {Apple, Banana}.</div>For example, given the set {Apple, Orange, Banana} there are one-element subsets like {Banana} and two-element subsets like {Apple, Banana}. The original set {Apple, Orange, Banana} counts, and so does the <em>empty set </em>{} with zero elements.</p>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first"><ol><li>Write down all the subsets of {Apple, Orange, Banana}. How many are there?</li>
<li>Write down all the subsets of {Apple, Orange, Banana, Pretzel}. Try to do this as simply as you can.</li></ol></div>
<p>The <code>subsets</code> block takes a list as input, and reports a <em>list of lists </em>in which each item is a subset of the input list.</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/subset-example.png" alt="subsets of {Apple, Orange, Banana}" /></p>
<p>It doesn't matter in what order the subsets appear in the output list, but each subset must appear exactly once.</p>
