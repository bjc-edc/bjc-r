            	GH feedback 8/2/15: Before having students code decimal to binary, they should probably spend some time doing the conversions by hand. Your examples are great but the kids need to do this on paper before they will be able to program ig.

    <p>In <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-number-representation/1-binary.html">Unit 4</a> you learned about binary representation of a number. In this project, you'll write a reporter <code>decimal-&gt;binary</code> that takes a <em>number</em> (which Snap<em>!</em> represents in decimal) as input, and reports a <em>string of zeros and ones</em> that represent the same number in binary:</p>

	<p align="left">To solve this problem, you'll need to work with integer division as quotient and remainder. For example, 17 รท 5 is <strong>3 remainder 2</strong>. Here's how to find the quotient and remainder in Snap<em>!</em>&thinsp;:</p><div class="sidenote">To find <code>floor</code> you'll need the <code>sqrt</code> block, then change the operation. The <strong>floor</strong> of a number is the largest integer less than or equal to that number. The floor of &pi; is 3.</div>
