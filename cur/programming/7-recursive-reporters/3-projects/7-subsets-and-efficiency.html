<h2>Subsets and Efficiency</h2>
<p>Here is one solution for the <code>subsets</code> block:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/subset-slow.png" alt="slow solution" /></p>

<p>This solution should remind you of the <code>pascal</code> block, which makes two recursive calls and adds the results. But the <code>pascal</code> block makes two recursive calls <em>with different inputs. </em>This <code>subsets</code> implementation makes <em>the same </em>recursive call twice, an inefficiency that can be corrected.</p>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first"><ol><li>Using a <code>count</code> variable, as you did for the <code>pascal</code> block, count how many recursive calls are made to find the 64 subsets of a six-element list.</li>
<li>Figure out how to reduce the number of recursive calls by avoiding redundant calls.</li></ol></div>
