        <h2>Hints for Binary Conversion</h2>

        <p>The biggest hint is that converting to binary should work from <strong>right to left</strong>, because the rightmost bit is always the ones column, while the leftmost bit's value changes depending on how many digits it has.</p>
		
		<p>The following exercises are hints; use as many or few as you need. Remember, the <strong>input</strong> to your block is a <strong>number</strong>, so you should do arithmetic on it; the value <strong>reported</strong> by your block is a <strong>text string</strong>, so you should make it using string operators.</p>

            <ol>
                <div class="sidenote">Try doing these calculations by hand, and look for connections. The connections may help you understand how to write your code.</div><li>Explain why 13 is 1101 in binary.</li>
				<li>Write 26 in binary. Write 27 in binary. How are each related to writing 13 in binary?</li>
				<li>What is the quotient and remainder when you divide 27 by 2?</li>

<div class="todo">BH suggests to delete hints 4 and 5.</div>

				<li>Start with 26, and divide by 2: the quotient is 13 and the remainder is 0. Continue with 13, repeating the process. Use this process to build the binary representation of 26.</li>
				<li>Repeat the previous problem, starting from 107. What is the binary representation of 107?</li>
				            </ol>
        </div >

                    Remember, you'll want to use the 
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/quotient.png" alt="quotient" /> and
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/mod.png" alt="mod" /> blocks. For binary, the quotient and remainder when dividing by 2 are the key.
