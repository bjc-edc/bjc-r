        <h2>Base Conversion</h2>

        <p>Here's one solution for binary conversion:</p>
        <p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/tobinary.png" alt="decimal-&gt;binary" /></p>
        <p>The base case is that the number fits in a single binary digit: it has to be less than 2. If so, the number, 0 or 1, is the desired output.</p>
        <p><div class="sidenote">It may be surprising that we don't use an arithmetic combiner, but the desired result is a <em>numeral</em>, a text string. This is why the combiner is a string operation.</div>In the recursive case, the rightmost binary digit is the remainder when dividing the number by 2. The other digits come from a recursive call on the quotient when dividing by 2. The combiner is <code>join</code> because we want to string the digits together.</p>

                <li>Write the <code>base7</code> block, which displays a number in base 7.</li>

       <p> 	Long ago, when computer circuits were very unreliable, some computers used a representation called <em>biquinary,</em> which used decimal digits, each of which was represented using five bits, of which exactly two had to be 1, and the other three had to be 0.  The five bits represented the values 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7. (Yes, that's a strange set of bit values.  Bear with us.)</p>

            	<li>Check that each of the values from 1 to 9 can be represented as the sum of two of those bit values in exactly one way.</li>
