        	<li>What are some challenges that computers have in displaying human intelligence? Maybe also just about robots in general?

Hm. My meandering took me to this interesting article: <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/SHR/4-2/text/hofstadter.html" target="_blank">On seeing A's and seeing As</a></li>
            <li>Not sure where/how/if to include this, but reading about AI is just interesting. Here's an online book <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~nilsson/QAI/qai.pdf" target="_blank">The Quest for Artificial Intelligence</a> that has a lot of history (I obviously did not read the whole thing, or even close).</li>
