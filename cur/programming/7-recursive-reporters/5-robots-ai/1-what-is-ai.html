        	<li>What are some challenges that computers have in displaying human intelligence? Maybe also just about robots in general? (even just the challenge robots have in not falling over) <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/honda-using-experimental-asimo-for-disaster-research" target="_blank">Here's one climbing a ladder</a> Just thinking about stuff like <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-ai-gets-better-at-seeing-the-world-by-learning-what-to-focus-on/" target="_blank">learning to see</a>along with stuff like emotions, love. Hm. My meandering took me to this interesting article: <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/SHR/4-2/text/hofstadter.html" target="_blank">On seeing A's and seeing As</a></li>
            <li>Not sure where/how/if to include this, but reading about AI is just interesting. Here's an online book <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~nilsson/QAI/qai.pdf" target="_blank">The Quest for Artificial Intelligence</a> that has a lot of history (I obviously did not read the whole thing, or even close).</li>

        <p><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> is a field of computer science 
        with a vague definition of &quot;trying to get computers to think.&quot;  This definition has led to a lot of arguments about whether a computer can ever <em>really</em> think, so John McCarthy, one of the founders of AI, defined it as &quot;getting computers to do things that, when done by human beings, are said to involve intelligence.&quot;  This definition allows AI researchers to get on with the work instead of spending time arguing about what &quot;thinking&quot; means.
