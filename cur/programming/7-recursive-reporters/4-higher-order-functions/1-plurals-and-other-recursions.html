        <h2>Plurals and Other Recursions</h2>
        <p><div class="sidenote">It's a vast simplification to say that adding "s" always forms the plural. If you like, you can include your work from the <code>plural</code> block you made in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/1-conditionals/5-plurals2.html">Unit 2</a>.</p>
</div>Here's the <code>plurals</code> block. It takes a <em>list of words</em> as input, and reports a list of the plurals of those words.</p>

<div class="takeNote">

            <p>The big idea here is that you can divide a list into its first item and all the rest of the items, form the plural of the first one, and make a recursive call for the rest. The <code>in front of</code> block may look strange at first, with its asymmetrical inputs (one item, one list), but it puts the plural of the first word and the plurals of the rest of the words back together.</p>

            <p><strong>Do the following exercises using recursion, not higher-order functions.</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Make a <code>squares</code> block that takes a list of numbers as input, and reports a list of the squares of the numbers.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Make an <code>exaggerate</code> block that takes a sentence as input, and reports a sentence in which every number in the input is doubled, "good" is replaced by "great," "bad" is replaced by "terrible," "like" is replaced by "love," and "dislike" is replaced by "hate." 
                    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/ex-ex.png" alt="exaggerate example" /></p>
                    <p>To do this, use a "wrapper" function that transforms the sentence into a list of words and back again:</p>

                    <p>You'll also want a helper function that exaggerates a single word.</p>
