<li>Build a block whose input is a tree number, and whose output is the number of segments in that level:</li>

                            <span>Alphie:</span> I noticed a pattern in the table. Each number of segments is one less than a power of 2.<br /></div>
<div>                            <span>Betty:</span> What does your code look like?<br /></div>
                           <div> <span>Alphie:</span> I used a <code>for</code> loop to build the power of 2, then I subtracted 1 at the end:<br /></div>

							<div><span>Betty:</span> Wow, mine looks a lot different. I thought the code should look a lot like the code for building a tree.<br /></div>
							<div><span>Alphie:</span> Interesting. Wait, I don't get it. <br /></div>
							<div><span>Betty:</span> Look back at the code for the tree. To build a tree, you use recursion. You build a segment, turn, build a smaller tree, turn again, then build another smaller tree.  <br /></div>
							<div><span>Alphie:</span> Oh, cool! Let me give this a shot. It looks like I can ignore the turning steps.<br /></div>
							<div><span>Betty:</span> Right! And don't forget: <em>base cases are important!</em><br /></div>
