        <h2>Working with Recursive Reporters</h2>


<p>Here's Betty's code for the <code>segments in tree</code> function.</p>

<li> What is the base case? Why is it necessary?</li>
<li>The <code>tree</code> command had two recursive calls, but this code only has one. Why?</li>

</ol>

</div  >


        <p>You've built and worked with recursive <em>command</em> blocks. Recursion can also be used in <em>reporters</em>. Thinking and programming with recursive reporters can often help solve otherwise complicated problems. </p>

<li>In Unit 6 you built the <code>triangle fractal</code> block. Build a block that reports the <em>total number of triangles</em> formed in a level <em>n</em> triangle fractal: </li><div class="sidenote">Re-read the code for the triangle fractal, and use it to help you build a recursive reporter.</div>

The only special case is the first row, which doesn't <em>have</em> a row above it, so we have to build in explicitly the fact that if the input is 0 the output should be 3:<br />

                	Fill in the empty parts of the following recursive reporter so that the block reports a sentence containing all the whole numbers from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>.  <strong>Note that this question does <em>not</em> involve a list.</strong> The inputs are numbers; the reported value is a text string (a sentence). What should the block report in the base case? Where does the recursive call go?<br />
