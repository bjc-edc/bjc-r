                <li>GH Feedback 7/31: The idea behind recursive vs explicit is fine. The blocks are easy to read. The problem is the math portion. The average HS junior will have had limited exposure to recursively defined functions. They may be able to handle the linear functions intuitively since they have been exposed to arithmetic and geometric sequences. Working with recursive linear equations with their knowledge of expertise is going to be challenging. However, they will not be able to work with the exponential functions. The average HS junior will have taken Common Core Algebra and Geometry and will have ZERO experience translating form recursive to explicit functions in mathematics. This is not appropriate on a HS level. You do not provide any math instruction here. I would have to spend a few days teaching recursive and explicit functions in mathematics before even attempting this lab. This course was intended for the lay-person. The mathematics portion on this page will alienate students and put them off of programming at this very early level.</li>

							<div><span>Alphie:</span> Interesting. Wait, I don't get it. <br /></div>
							<div><span>Betty:</span> Look back at the code for the tree. To build a tree, you use recursion. You build a segment, turn, build a smaller tree, turn again, then build another smaller tree.  <br /></div>
							<div><span>Alphie:</span> Oh, cool! Let me give this a shot. It looks like I can ignore the turning steps.<br /></div>

<div class="todo">BK: Maybe this is a place to split pages? I have to include Betty's code because I don't know if kids will recognize they can collapse the multiple recursive calls. But then it's right below where they're asked to write the code! Split pages would solve this, but I don't feel like the page is then otherwise a full class.</div>
