        <h2>Sorting a List</h2>
        <p>Suppose we have a list of names like this:</p>
        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/unsortednames.png" width="10%" alt="Eight names" /></p>
        <p>What we want is a list of the same names, <strong>sorted</strong> in alphabetical (ascending) order:</p><div class="sidenote">These could be numbers instead of names, or anything that can be compared and ordered. Numbers and words often need to be sorted.</div>
        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/sortednames.png" width="10%" alt="Eight names, sorted" /></p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Invent an algorithm for sorting the names. Try to describe the algorithm in enough detail so that someone else could use your description to sort a list.</li>
                <li>Now build your algorithm: a <code>sort</code> block that inputs a list and outputs a new list in alphabetical order. Test your algorithm using both names and numbers.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
<div class="takeNote">Comparing numbers and strings can be done using the same blocks, so your sorting algorithm should work equally well for names and numbers.

<li>Share your sorting algorithms. Describe some similarities and differences between different sorting algorithms.</li>

<p>There are many different algorithms to sort a list. Sorting algorithms give the same result, but the code and efficiency can vary greatly from one algorithm to another. The next two pages highlight two frequently used sorting algorithms.</p>

        <p>There are many different sorting algorithms. But the best one for recursively generated lists, and probably the most elegant, is called <em>mergesort. </em>Here's the idea in a nutshell: Divide the list in half; recursively sort each half; then merge the two sorted sublists. The base case is that an empty list or a one-item list is already sorted.</p>
        <p>The easiest way to divide a list in half turns out to be putting the odd-numbered items in one half and the even-numbered items in the other. You do this with a recursion that skips over an item each time:</p>
        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/odds.png" alt="odd items" /></p>
        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/evenitems.png" alt="even items" /></p>
        <p>All the work here, basically, is done by the <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/bfbf.png" alt="all but first of all but first of" /> in <code>odd numbered items</code>. This skips the second item and makes the recursive call on items 3 through the end of the list. Note that <code>even numbered items</code> is not <em>directly </em>recursive; it calls <code>odd numbered items</code>, not itself.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="4"><li>Why does <code>odd numbered items</code> need two base cases?</li>
                <li>Write a version of <code>even numbered items</code> that calls itself recursively instead of using <code>odd numbered items</code>.</li>
                <li>Can you write a version of <code>odd numbered items</code> that uses (the original) <code>even numbered items</code> instead of calling itself recursively? That program structure (A calls B, B calls A) is called <em><strong>mutual recursion</strong>.</em></li>
            </ol>
