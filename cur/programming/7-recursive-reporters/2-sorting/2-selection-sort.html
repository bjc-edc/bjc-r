        <h2>Selection Sort</h2>

        <p>One of the most commonly used sorts is called a <strong>selection sort</strong>. Here's how it works:
            <ul>
                <li><div class="sidenote">The earliest item might be the first name in alphabetical order, or the smallest number in a list.</div><strong>Step 1.</strong> In an unsorted list, determine the item that should come earliest in the sort.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Pull the selected item out of the list and place it in the first position.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> With the remaining items, use a selection sort to put them in order. If there are no remaining items, you're done.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <!--
        <li><strong>Step 3.</strong> With the remaining items, select the item that should come next in the sort.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Pull the item out of the list and place it.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5.</strong> Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until there is only one item left.</li> -->
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>With your class, stand up and form a line. Then, follow the selection sort process to put everyone in sorted, alphabetical order by first name.</li>
                <li>How is a selection sort an example of recursion? What is the base case?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>A video of one version of selection sort can be found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8hXR_Hvybo">here.</a></p>
        <p>To write a <code>selection sort</code> block in Snap<em>!</em>, you'll need code for a base case, and code that follows the steps of the selection sort.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">        
            <ol start="3">
                <li>
                    Write the <code>earliest in</code> block. For names, this returns the first name alphabetically in a list:<br />

                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/earliestin.png" alt="Earliest name for alphabetical order" />
                </li>
                <li>Write code that finds the <em>index</em> of the earliest item. This value is 8 for the list of names above.</li>
                <li>
                    <div class="sidenote">You may find some of your work in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/2-improving-search">Unit 5</a> helpful.</div>
                    Write code that creates a new list with the earliest item deleted. There is more than one way to do this!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Build the recursive reporter <code>selection sort</code>.<br />

                </li>
                <li>How many times does <code>selection sort</code> call itself?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeNote">Like recursive commands, the results of recursive reporters can feel like magic, because part of the code tells the recursive reporter to call itself. Recursive reporters work because each time, the new call is a simpler output of the same reporter, eventually working back to the base case.</div>
