        <h2>Selection Sort</h2>

<p>One of the most commonly used sorts is called a <strong>selection sort</strong>. Here's how it works:</p>

<ul>
<li><div class="sidenote">The earliest item might be the first name in alphabetical order, or the smallest number in a list.</div><strong>Step 1.</strong> In an unsorted list, select the item that should come earliest in the sort.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Pull the item out of the list and place it first.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3.</strong> With the remaining items, select the item that should come next in the sort.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Pull the item out of the list and place it.</li>
<li><strong>Step 5.</strong> Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until there is only one item left.</li>
</ul>

<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">

<ol>
<li>With your class, stand up and form a line. Then, follow the selection sort process to put the class in sorted, alphabetical order by first name.</li>
<li>In what way is a selection sort an example of recursion? What is the base case?</li>
</ol>
</div>

One way to see the recursion is to change the description of Steps 3-5 to this:

<ul>
<li><strong>Steps 3-5.</strong> <em>With the remaining items, put them in order using a selection sort.</em></li>
</ul>

To solve the problem in Snap<em>!</em>, you'll need code for a base case, and code that follows the steps of the selection sort.

<div class="forYouToDo">

<ol start="3">

<li>Write the <code>earliest in</code> block. For names, this returns the first name alphabetically in a list:</li>

        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/unsortednames.png" width="10%" alt="Eight names" /><img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/earliestin.png" alt="Earliest name for alphabetical order" /></p>

<li>Write code that uses the result of the <code>earliest in</code> block to create a new list with that item deleted. There is more than one way to do this, but you may find some of your work in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/2-improving-search">Unit 5</a> helpful.</li>

<li>Build the recursive reporter <code>selection sort</code>.</li>

<img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/selectionresult.png" alt="Result of a selection sort on eight names" />

<li>How many times does <code>selection sort</code> call itself?</li>

</ol>

</div>

<div class="takeNote">Like recursive commands, the results of recursive reporters can feel like magic, because part of the code tells the recursive reporter to call itself. Recursive reporters work because each time, the new call is a simpler output of the same reporter, eventually working back to the base case.</div>

<div class="takeItFurther">

<ol start="A">

<li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/5-data-processing/yob2014.txt">This file</a> contains a large list of baby names from 2014. Import the data, then build an algorithm that returns an alphabetical list of all names starting with a given letter:

 </li>

</ol>
