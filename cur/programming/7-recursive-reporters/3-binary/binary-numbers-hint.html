                <li>GH Feedback 4/8/15: Kids who are weak in math are going to be destroyed by this page. There needs to be scaffolding. It might be worth showing how a number such as 91 gets processed such that 1011011 by means of MOD and integer division (/, FLOOR). This is a challenging problem for newbies even if they have done a few recursion problems already.</li>
			</ul>
        </div>

        <p>Okay, here's the hint:  Positional notation works from right to left.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
            <ol>
                <li>Quick: What's the <em>rightmost </em>digit in the binary representation of 15551212? What's the rightmost bit (&quot;<strong>b</strong>inary dig<strong>it</strong>&quot;) of 123456789?  How did you know?  How can Snap<em>!</em> know the rightmost bit of a number represented in binary?</li>
                <li>What numbers can be represented in a single bit?  How will you tell Snap<em>!</em> about this?  (It's the base case.)</li>
                <li>
                    Okay, now write the block script:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/hint.png" alt="hint: if report else report" /><br />
                    Don't turn the page until you have this working. Don't forget
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/quotient.png" alt="quotient" />
                    <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursive-reporters/mod.png" alt="mod" />
                    but dividing by 2 instead of by 5.
