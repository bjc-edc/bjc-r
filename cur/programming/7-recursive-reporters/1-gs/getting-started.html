        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>You&rsquo;ve built and worked with recursive <em>command</em> blocks. Recursion can also be used in <em>reporters</em>. Thinking and programming with recursive reporters can often help solve otherwise complicated problems. </p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <div class="sidenote" style="position:relative;top:730px;">What exactly is Tony’s <code>map</code> block doing?</div>
            <!-- Putting the divs up here and with that much relative positioning is not a good permanent solution. -Mary, 5/18/15 -->
            <div class="sidenote" style="position:relative;top:1000px;">
                <!--Here it makes sense to use the strong tag because we are not technically within a dialogue. -Mary, 5/18/15 -->
                <strong>Derman:</strong> Yours is more complicated.<br /> 
                <strong>Sasha:</strong> But that pattern was easier to spot (for me).

                            Just to be sure, I’ll try it:<br />

                            <span>Sasha:</span> I see another way to match the table. If you look down the Output column, each number is two more than the one above it.  The only special case is the first row, which doesn't <em>have</em> a row above it, so we have to build in explicitly the fact that if the input is 0 the output should be 3:<br />

                	Fill in the empty parts of the following definition so that the block reports a sentence containing all the whole numbers from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>.  <strong>Note that this question does <em>not</em> involve a list.</strong> The inputs are numbers; the reported value is a text string (a sentence). What should the block report in the base case? Where does the recursive call go?<br />
