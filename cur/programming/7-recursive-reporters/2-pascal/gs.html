        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <p>You're in a class with a total of five students: Rocky, Bullwinkle, Peabody, Sherman, and <u>(your name here)</u>. You want to choose a committee to get the refreshments for the class party.  Remember that "Rocky and Sherman" is the same committee as "Sherman and Rocky."</p>
            <ol>
                <li>How many different committees of three people include Bullwinkle?</li>
                <div class="commentBig">Questions 2 and 3 don't make sense to me. I don't understand what they are asking. --MF</div>
                <li>If a committee of three people includes Bullwinkle, how many <em>more</em> people are on the committee?</li>
                <li>If a committee of three people includes Bullwinkle, how many other students (besides Bullwinkle) are eligible to be on the committee?</li>
                <div class="commentBig">It kind of seems like questions 2-4 are supposed to help with Q1, but students will never get to 2-4 if they think they have to do 1 first. If I'm correct, then we need a formatting change here. If I'm wrong, then we need some more clarity. --MF</div>
                <li>How many committees of two people could you make from a class of four students?</li>
                <hr />
                <div class="commentBig">I have the same kind of feedback here for 5-7. I don't understand 6, and both 6 and 7 seem to be building toward 5, which has already passed. --MF</div>
                <li>How many different committees of three people <em>don't</em> include Bullwinkle?</li>
                <!-- <div><div class="sidenote">Some people call this the ``distinguished member method.''   Bullwinkle is the distinguished member.  You count all the committees that contain Bullwinkle, then count all the committees that don't, and then ... .</div></div>  -->
                <li>If a committee doesn't include Bullwinkle, how many students are eligible to be on it?</li>
                <li>How many committees of three people could you make from a class of four students?</li>
                <hr />
                <div class="comment">Number formatting inconsistent. --MF</div>
                <li>How many different committees of three people are there <em>altogether</em> in a group of five students?</li>
                <li>How many 2-person committees can you make from 5 students??</li>
                <!-- <div><div class="sidenote">One idea:  use the result of problem~\ref{fipro} and the distinguished member method.</div></div> -->
                <li>How many 3-person committees can you make from 6 students?  See if you can use the results from earlier questions to help answer this one.</li>
                <hr />
                <li>How many 1-member committees can you form from 100 students?</li>
                <li>How many 99-member committees can you form from 100 students?</li>
                <li>How many 100-member committees can you form from 100 students?</li>
                <!-- <div><div class="sidenote">How can you have a committee with~0 members?  Find a way for that to make sense..</div></div>  -->
                <div class="commentBig">I'm not sure what we are going for with the "Does it make sense...?" question. Also, #15 should be right after #10 and the grammar needs attention. --MF</div>
                <li>How many 0-member committees can you make from 100 students?  (Does it make any sense to talk about a 0-member committee?)</li>
                <hr /> 
                <li>How did you solve question 10? Describe your method in words, so precisely that others in your class understand it.
