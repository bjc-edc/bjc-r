        <p>JK: Just brainstorming about this lab</p>
        <p>Comments added -- bh</p>
        <p>At our 2/16 meeting, we agreed that it's important to add in AI stuff. <strong>Since U6 is shorter, let's put 2 SI labs there: "Computing in Work" and "Computing in War" and put 1 SI lab in U7: "Robots and Artificial Intelligence."</strong> --MF</p>
        <p>Work</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Could ask students to name jobs that didn't exist 25 years ago; name jobs that existed 25 years ago that no longer exist (or have virtually disappeared); name jobs of the future that don't exist yet.</li>
        	<li>What are some jobs that computers will "never" be able to do?</li>
        	<li>What are some dangerous/impossible jobs that humans couldn't previously do, but computers can make possible. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cockroach-like-robots-may-be-the-future-of-disaster-help/" target="_blank">Cockroach-ish disaster robots</a> <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/3031657/robotics/navy-calls-on-researchers-to-create-firefighting-humanoid-robot.html" target="_blank">Firefighting robots</a> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/600779/artificial-intelligence-offers-a-better-way-to-diagnose-malaria/" target="_blank">or stuff computers are just better at</a></li>
        	<li>Computers affect the <em>style</em> of work, even if they don't take your job away. 
        	  <ul>
        	    <li>The canonical example is people who take phone calls from customers at big companies (including Directory Assistance operators at the phone company). Their workstations collect information about how long it takes each worker to handle a call, on average, and also on how well the customer rates the worker. Managers see all this information in real time and can yell at slow or surly workers.       	        </li>
        	    <li>Some employers put key-card locks on the rest rooms, so their computers can collect information on who takes a lot of bathroom breaks.</li>
        	    <li>Uber competes with licensed taxis, without having to follow the licensing rules; some cities have banned them for this reason. Uber drivers are considered independent contractors, so Uber doesn't have to provide health insurance or unemployment compensation, and yet arguably Uber determines their conditions of work, so they <em>should</em> be employees. (All this has to be explained in a way understandable to students of course.)</li>
        	    <li>It <em>is</em> possible to use computers in ways that improve the conditions of work. Scandinavian countries, in which, by law, unions must be represented on corporate boards of directors, have experimented along these lines. The idea is to set up computer systems that give the worker the right information at the right time, without telling the worker what to do.</li>
       	      </ul>
        	</li>
        	<li>Computers affect the distribution of jobs among communities by enabling long-distance work. This is why customer service operators often have Indian accents these days: They're really in India! This is good for Indian workers but not so good for American workers. Even intellectual work -- in particular, even computer programming -- can be outsourced. Cf. Amazon Mechanical Turk. (There was a news story about somebody who got hired as a programmer in the US and used Mechanical Turk to outsource his entire job, since programmers in India aren't paid as much as ones in the US. I think he got found out eventually.)
        	  <ul>
        	    <li>Sometimes computer-mediated outsourcing is a social good for reasons that aren't directly economic, such as the provision of medical care in remote rural areas by doctors in the city plus nurses in the remote areas.</li>
       	      </ul>
        	</li>
        	<li>Rural third-world farmers benefit from the ability to get up-to-date food prices in the big city, so that the wholesalers who bring their produce to the city don't take advantage of them in price negotiation.</li>
        	<li>I'd like to say something, if we can make it understandable, about the way non-physical products (software, movies, etc.) distort the market for physical stuff (especially housing). People get rich on ideas, but you can't eat ideas, and the supply of real stuff isn't infinitely expandable, so in effect real stuff becomes more expensive for people not in the virtual-stuff business.</li>
        	<li>Etc.  I think &quot;work&quot; can fill up this entire unit, putting &quot;war&quot; in U7 (or vice versa, whichever).</li>
       	  </ul>
        <p>War</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Explain: "War is all about technology" - in what ways is war related to technology? 
        	  <ul>
        	    <li>Who wins a war is largely determined by technology, more than by the size of armies, etc. Students may know the example of the importance of metal-clad warships in the Civil War.
        	      <ul>
        	        <li>New technology changes the rules. For a long time you could make a clear distinction between soldiers and civilians, and just do battle with soldiers. But the ability to drop bombs from airplanes undid that.</li>
      	        </ul>
        	    </li>
        	    <li>Dual use: How have we benefited from technologies developed for war (nuclear energy, space race, GPS, drones)
      	        </li>
        	    <li>Professional codes of ethics all say you shouldn't build technology that's harmful. Is it justifiable to work for the military, or for a military contractor?
        	      <ul>
        	        <li>Is there such a thing as a good war?
        	          <ul>
        	            <li>Are US wars good?</li>
      	            </ul>
        	        </li>
       	          </ul>
        	    </li>
       	      </ul>
        	</li>
   	      <li>Autonomous weapons. This <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/01/25/if-killer-robots-arrive-the-terminator-will-be-the-least-of-our-problems/" target="_blank">article about killer robots</a>. <a href="http://futureoflife.org/open-letter-autonomous-weapons/" target="_blank">open letter about autonomous weapons</a>. History of Star Wars.</li>
            <li>Drones! The key point in this whole topic is that the ability to conduct war from home eliminates the human cost (i.e., dead Americans), which is what voters care about, and therefore make it much easier for a president to choose to go to war overseas without worrying about political consequences. This is really different from previous weapons technologies.<ul><li>We can't say that "dead Americans...is what voters care about." Not only is that cynical, but it's also not true. Plenty of voters care about hurting people of any nationality and would prefer to resolve conflicts without war. --MF</li></ul></li>

        <p>Robots and Artificial Intelligence</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>What are some challenges that computers have in displaying human intelligence? Maybe also just about robots in general? (even just the challenge robots have in not falling over) <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/honda-using-experimental-asimo-for-disaster-research" target="_blank">Here's one climbing a ladder</a> Just thinking about stuff like <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-ai-gets-better-at-seeing-the-world-by-learning-what-to-focus-on/" target="_blank">learning to see</a>along with stuff like emotions, love. Hm. My meandering took me to this interesting article: <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/SHR/4-2/text/hofstadter.html" target="_blank">On seeing A's and seeing As</a></li>
            <li>Research - look up and read about some recent breakthroughs in AI</li>
            <li>How does AI force us to redefine certain ideas? Relatively tame example: <a href="http://www.eweek.com/mobile/googles-ai-system-is-the-driver-in-self-driving-cars-nhtsa-rules.html" target="_blank">Needing to redefine "driver"</a>. Also need to define what it means to be "human"...<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/study-nobody-wants-social-robots-that-look-like-humans" target="_blank">humanoid robots</a> <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/the-uncanny-valley" target="_blank">Uncanny valley</a></li>
            <li>Write/debate/discuss - ideas like limits to developing robots, what could go wrong?, humans being surpassed by robots</li>
