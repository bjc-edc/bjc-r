            How to load the Tools Sprite

        BYOB comes with a collection of blocks, written in BYOB, that provide commonly useful tools. There are a lot of them, but we're going to concentrate on just a few. These tools can be added to your project by importing the Tools Sprite. (You don't need the sprite itself, but a sprite can be used as a kind of "suitcase" for custom blocks. That's why you're going to import the sprite and then immediately delete it, which seems silly. But deleting the sprite leaves the blocks behind.)
        <p>
            This is a short tutorial on how to load it up onto BYOB:
            <br>
            1) Open the BYOB program
        </p>
        
        <p>
            2) Locate your BYOB folder (if you didn't open BYOB from there) and find ToolSprite.ysp.
        </p>

        <p>
            3) Now simply click and drag ToolSprite.ysp anywhere in the opened BYOB window
            <br>
            4) You will now see all the new blocks that were imported from the tools sprite in each of the palettes, and you can read the description of each of them if you like in the workspace. After you are done, you can delete the sprite that was created. Hooray! You have successfully installed the tools blocks.

        <p></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Here's an alternative way of importing the tools:</b>
        <p></p>
        1) In BYOB, go to "File" on top and click on "Import Project".
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/import-project.png" title="There should be an image here" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab19/Lab19-004.png">
        </div>
        <p></p>
        2) In the "Import Project" window, locate your BYOB folder and find the "tools" file. Click on the file, then press OK.
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;"><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/import-tool-sprite.png" title="There should be an image here" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab19/Lab19-005.png">
        </div>
        <p></p>
        4) After checking that the new blocks are in their palettes, delete the tools sprite in bottom right.
