		<h2>Activity</h2> Try to make an electric keyboard! The code below shows a start:

We have provided a few images below that you can print out to work with.

When the letter that is mapped to the key is pressed you can darken the key by changing its costume to simulate it being pressed.
		<br>
		<br>
		Add additional functionality, perhaps by adding scripts for other keys on the computer keyboard, so that your electric keyboard can change:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Volume,
			</li>
			<li>
				Instrument, and/or
			</li>
			<li>
				Tempo.
			</li>
		</ul>
