We have written a program that displays one number based upon a variable named <code>digit</code>. You can download the program <a title="Digital display" href="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab02/DigitalDisplay.sb">here</a>. You should modify this program to work for five digits! (Initially, however, you may want to start by modifying it just to work with two digits.) 
<h2>How does the original code work?</h2> We have created a <code>MyDigit</code> sprite with ten different costumes, one for each digit, as shown below. Costume 1 corresponds to the digit <code>1</code>, costume 2 corresponds to the digit <code>2</code> and so on. Costume 10 corresponds to the digit <code>0</code>. Each costume has a name (for example, <code>one</code>, as shown circled in yellow) and a number (for example, <code>1</code>, as shown circled in red). <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" title="Digital display" alt="Digital display" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/Digit-Costumes-BYOB.jpg" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab02/Score_Display/Costumes.jpg"><br></div> <br> When we use the <code>switch to costume</code> block, we can specify either the name or the costume number. In the script below, we use the costume number (1-9) to set the costume unless the digit is 0. If the digit is 0, we cannot just tell it to switch to costume 0 (because there is no costume 0), so we have to use the name of the costume (<code>zero</code>).

The modulus operator is used to return the remainder of a division operation. It might remind us how we answered division problems before we learned about decimals(e.g. 10 / 3 = 3 remainder 1). 10 mod 3 = 1. As you complete this assignment, consider the place value of each digit you need to change. If I am counting down from 25. I can grab the "5" off of 25 by doing 25 mod 10 since 25 mod 10 = 5. And I can grab the "2" by performing the following operation: <br><br> [[25 - [25 mod 10]] mod 100] / 10 = <br> [[25 - 5] mod 100] / 10 = <br> [20 mod 100] / 10 =<br> [20] / 10 = <br> 2(!) <br><br><br> For more explanation on the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">mod</span> block, right-click on the block and select <code>Help</code>.<br><br> Here's a sample of how the countdown timer should work when it starts at 24:<br><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div>
