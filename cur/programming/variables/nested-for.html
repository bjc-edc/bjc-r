   <p>The ability to change the name of the <code>for</code> variable isn't just to make your program self-documenting, although that would be a good reason by itself. But changing the variable name is crucial for <em>nesting </em><code>for</code> blocks, like this:</p>
   <p><img src="../../../img/prog/pentastar-script.png" alt="pentastar script"> <img src="../../../img/prog/pentastar.png" alt="pentastar"></p>
   <p>The overall structure of this picture is an invisible (because the pen is up while it's traced out) pentagonal spiral. Here are the last few sides of that spiral:</p>
   <p><img src="../../../img/prog/pentastar-visible.png" alt="pentagonal spiral visible"></p>
   <p>At each vertex (or corner) of that spiral, the script draws a visible (pen down) star-shaped spiral. The script has to keep track of the length of the next pentagon-spiral side and also the length of the next star-spiral side. So it's important that we used two different variable names, <code>pentalen</code> for the pentagon-spiral length and <code>starlen</code> for the star-spiral length.</p>
   <p>By the way, if you're impatient with how long it takes for <span class="snap">snap</span>  to draw these pictures, find the grey warp block in the Control palette and put the entire script inside it:</p>
   <p><img src="../../../img/prog/warp.png" alt="warp"></p>
   <p>Predict what the following script will do before you try it. (Write down everything it will say, in the right order.)</p>
   <p><img src="../../../img/prog/sayjoinfor.png" alt="sayjoinfor"></p>
   <p>Optional open-ended problem: We've been drawing spirals by repeating a <code>move</code>-and-<code>turn</code> sequence with a varying <code>move</code> length and a constant <code>turn</code> angle. What kinds of pictures will you get if you use a constant <code>move</code> and a varying <code>turn</code>? Don't decide too quickly that you've exhausted the possibilities; you can get an infinite variety of shapes! (And draw at least 300 repetitions in each experiment.)</p>
