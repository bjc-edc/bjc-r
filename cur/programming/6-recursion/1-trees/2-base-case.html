		<h2>The Base Case</h2>	
        <p>
        	<div class="sidenote">Recall, a <em>recursive</em> script is a script that calls itself.</div>
        	<p>Last time, we tried to replace all the numbered tree scripts with a single script following this pattern:</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        	<p><img src="/bjc-r/prog/6-recursion/tree-2-script.png" height="267" alt="tree 2 script\">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="/bjc-r/prog/6-recursion/tree-3-script.png" height="267" alt="tree 3 script">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="/bjc-r/prog/6-recursion/recursiveTree-wo-base.png" height="267"  alt="recursive tree without base case"></p>
       <!-- 	<p>We first tried to build the recursive tree by using the same script as for <code>tree2</code>, <code>tree3</code>, etc. and replacing the call to a lower-level tree with a call to <code>tree</code> itself but with a lower level input, like this:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/tree-recursive-call.png" alt="tree level: (level - 1) size: (size × 0.65)" title="tree level: (level - 1) size: (size × 0.65)" />
    </p>
            </p>    -->
<p>
        	It didn't work:<br />

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What's going wrong?</strong> Because of the recursive call to <code>tree</code>, the sprite draws smaller and smaller left branches (until it ends up looking like it's just spinning around in one place) without ever drawing a right branch and finishing the tree. The problem is that the original numbered <code>tree1</code>, <code>tree2</code>, etc. blocks <em>aren't </em>all the same. The first one, <code>tree1</code>, is different; it just draws a line <em>without any branches</em> and puts the sprite back.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/tree1.png" alt="tree1 script" />

        </p>
        <p><strong>So our recursive <code>tree</code> block has to do something different when the <var>level</var> is 1.</strong> It has to draw just a line without adding another branch.</p>
        <div class="takeNote"><p class="center">This different version for the lowest level of a recursive script is called the <strong>base case</strong>.</p></div>
        
        <div class="dialogue">
            <div>
                <span>Betsy:</span> Let's think through a simple tree to figure out how this "base case" needs to work. Let's look at <code>tree3</code> with size 40.<br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/tree3.png" alt="tree3 block definition" title="tree3 block definition" />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/tree3-call.png" alt="clear, point in direction (0), pen down, tree3 size: (40)" title="clear, point in direction (0), pen down, tree3 size: (40)" />
            </div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Ok, after clearing the stage, pointing up, and putting the pen down, the sprite will move 40 steps and then turn 25&deg; left. And then it will call <code>tree2</code> with a smaller size.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Right. And then from the <code>tree2</code> code, which is almost the same, it will move that smaller number steps, turn 25&deg; left, and then call <code>tree1</code>, which just draws a line and goes back. Then, it will turn 60&deg; to the right and draw another little <code>tree1</code> branch and go back. <em>And then</em> it will turn 35&deg; back to the left and move the sprite back to the beginning of that Y-shaped, <code>tree2</code> branch. So, it will look like this:</div>
            <div class="stagedir"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/tree3-drawing-partial.jpg" alt="drawing of tree3 after the first tree2 is called" title="drawing of tree3 after the first tree2 is called" /></div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Yup. And then it will finish the <code>tree3</code> script by turning 60&deg; to the right and going through the whole <code>tree2</code> script again to create the other side, and then it will turn back 35&deg; and move backwards to the very beginning.</div>
            <div class="stagedir"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/tree3-drawing-complete.jpg" alt="drawing of tree3 after the first tree2 is called" title="drawing of tree3 after the first tree2 is called" /></div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> Great. That finishes the <code>tree3</code> script. Now, about that "base case" thing for the recursive <code>tree</code> script... The base case is the lowest level of the recursion, so that's like the <code>tree1</code>. </div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> Yeah, and the <code>tree1</code> script stops the branches from branching off forever because it just draws a line and doesn't make another tree.</div>
            <div><span>Betsy:</span> So, we need our <em>recursive</em> <code>tree</code> block to draw a little line at level 1 instead of making more little trees forever.</div>
        </div>

                <li>
                    Correct your recursive <code>tree</code> block so it includes a base case to stop the script from calling itself forever:<br />
        			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/tree.png" alt="correct tree block definition" title="correct tree block definition" />
                </li>
                <li>
                	Point the sprite up, put the pen down, and run <code>tree level: 9 size: 50</code>. Now it  should work, and you should get a result like this:<br />

                </li>
                <li>The amount of time required to draw the tree goes up very quickly with the number of levels, so we don't recommend trying 20 levels. But try timing level 8 through level 12.</li>

            <p><em>Recursive</em> scripts call themselves, but they can't keep doing it forever; they have to stop and go back at some point. That point is the <strong>base case</strong>, the simpler version of the script that <em>doesn't call the block itself</em>. This is typical in recursion.</p>
            <p>There is usually a <em>conditional</em> (like <code>if-else</code>) with two cases: a <em>base case</em> for the lowest level that stops the recursion from going on forever and a <strong>recursive case</strong> that calls the script itself again and again at lower levels until it reaches the base case.</p>
            <p>When a script <em>does</em> keep recursively calling itself forever (like when the sprite was just spinning around in one place), that's a bug, and we say the program is stuck in an <strong>infinite loop</strong>.</p>
