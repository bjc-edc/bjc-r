		<h2>Recursive Tree</h2>	
        <p>The branching pattern on many plants has <strong>fractal</strong> structure: the smaller parts are like miniature copies of the whole plant. <br />
            <div class="sidenoteBig">A <strong>fractal</strong> is an infinite repeating pattern made up of copies (or slight variations) of the same shape. In this picture, the green branch is (essentially) the same shape as the entire picture.</div>
            <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/greentree.gif" alt="fractal tree" title="fractal tree" /><br />
            In this lab, you will build a tree using <em>blocks within blocks</em> to create the branches. Each branch will be a smaller copy of essentially the same tree.
        </p>

        <p>These blocks all look essentially the same except that <code>tree 5</code> uses <code>tree 4</code>, while <code>tree 4</code> uses <code>tree 3</code>, and so on. So it makes sense to wonder if we can  replace all these blocks with a single <code>tree</code> block, using a variable for the number that changes. </p>

                    It might seem that all we need to do is build this (with the parts stuck together instead of the gaps that we show). In fact, this is not quite right, but it's worth trying to see what happens. Build it and try <code>tree</code> with the input levels of 5, 3, and 1 (still using size 50).<br />
