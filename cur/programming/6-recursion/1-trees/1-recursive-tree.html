		<h2>Recursive Tree</h2>	
        <p>The branching pattern on many plants has what is called <strong>fractal</strong> structure: the smaller parts are like miniature copies of the whole. <br />
            <div class="sidenoteBig">A <strong>fractal</strong> is an infinite repeating pattern made up of copies (or slight variations) of the same shape. In this picture, the green tree is (essentially) the same shape as the entire picture.</div>
            <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/greentree.gif" alt="fractal tree" title="fractal tree" /><br />
            In this lab, you will build a tree using <em>blocks within blocks</em> to create the branches. Each branch will be a smaller copy of essentially the same tree.

                            Build this <code>tree1</code> block: <br />

                       	Build <code>tree2</code> that draws two levels. Actually, you're going to make two different versions of this, so call the first one <code>tree2a</code>:<br />

                            Trace through the code carefully. Describe the role of each block in producing the drawing.

                          <li>How many blocks would you need to write <code>tree3a</code> out of Motion blocks similarly to how we wrote <code>tree2a</code>? How about <code>tree4a</code>?</li></ol></div>

<li>That <code>tree2a</code> block is pretty long and repetitive. But we can simplify it if we notice that in two places it has a move forward/move back pair of blocks, and that this is what <code>tree1</code> does! So we can use <code>tree1</code> to shorten <code>tree2</code>. Compare the code below to convince yourself that the new <code>tree2</code> will work the same as the original <code>tree2a</code>.<br /><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/tree2.png" alt="tree2 block definition" title="tree2 block definition" />                      </li>
						<li>Describe exactly the position and direction of the sprite when the first <code>tree1</code> stops running. Why is that essential for <code>tree2</code> to work?</li>

                    If you can stand it, make a <code>tree5</code> block that uses the <code>tree4</code> block. Running <code>tree5 size: 50</code> should produce a result like this:<br />

        <p><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/take-turns-speaking-mini.gif" alt="Take turns speaking" title="Take turns speaking"> These blocks all look exactly the same, don't they? So it makes sense to wonder if we can replace them all with a single <code>tree</code> block. The differences between numbered blocks are only that <code>tree5</code> uses <code>tree4</code>, while <code>tree4</code> uses <code>tree3</code>, and so on. We can use that fact to write a <code>tree</code> block that uses <code>tree</code> itself in its own script, provided that we replace the numbers in the names with another input to keep track of the level.</p>
        <div class="takeNote center">Using a block inside of itself is called <strong>recursion</strong>.</div>
        <p>When <code>tree</code> is called with <var>level</var> 5, it should draw the same picture as <code>tree5</code>, so it will draw two trees of <var>level</var> 4; each of them will draw two trees of <var>level</var> 3, and so on. </p>
