<h2>Recursive Tree, Part 1</h2>

    <ul>
    	<li>JK: Teachers at the EDC PD day (and I saw this in NY too) were confused by the name of the block. I think this is partly because it's called <code>tree1</code> in the text, but really should be called <code>tree1 size</code>. The fact that "size" appears twice confuses lots of people. (I think getting rid of the plus signs in the image will be helpful too.)</li>
    </ul>

			Our goal is to draw a tree like this.<br />

			We'll   start with a simpler version that shows the technique clearly, although less prettily:

  <div class="sidenote">Technically, all the images in this unit are just <em>approximations</em> to fractals, because the smaller pictures are simpler than the complete picture.  You have to imagine that we have infinitely many smaller and smaller branches.</div></div>
		<p>
			The key to understanding this technique is to see that the tree is a <i>fractal,</i> that is, a picture that contains smaller versions of itself:

			We're going to create a <code>tree</code> block in Snap<em>!</em>. It'll start with a <code>move</code> block to draw the trunk of the tree, then a <code>turn</code> block turning left, <i>then a <code>tree</code> block</i>&thinsp; to draw the left smaller tree, and so on.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Wait!" you're probably thinking. "How can we use a <code>tree</code> block inside a <code>tree</code> block? It doesn't exist yet!" That's the big idea for this assignment.
		</p>
		<p>
			We're going to work up to the complicated tree starting with very simple steps that don't involve <code>tree</code>-within-<code>tree</code>.

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <div>
	<ol>	<li> Make a <code>tree1</code> block (so named because it draws just one level of the tree) using this script: <br />
		
      <div><div class="sidenote">The empty input in the <code>-</code> block doesn't get anything put in it from a list; we aren't using higher order functions here.  This just says to move <code>-size</code> steps.</div></div>

		<p>
			This looks ridiculously simple, but trust us, it'll get interesting soon. When run, the script draws one tree branch, <i>and then moves the sprite back
            to its original position.</i> That's going to be really important when we start using scripts within scripts; we always want to be able to assume that our
            tree blocks leave the sprite in the same position and direction as it started in.
		</p></li>
		<li> <strong>Point the sprite facing upward</strong>, and put the pen down. Then try <code>tree1 size 50</code>. You should get a result something like this: <br />

		<li> Make a <code>tree2</code> block that draws two levels. Actually, you're going to make two different versions of this, so call the first one <code>tree2a</code>.<br />

		<p>
			When run, it should give this result:

At this rate you'll never be able to make the beautiful version of the
tree in this century. In the next step, we'll discuss how to simplify
this process. <br />

<div class="takeNote">		Before going on, make sure that you can
mentally trace through the code provided. Paying close attention to the
<code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks is going to be important to see the big picture and
understand the recursion.
    </div><div class="takeItFurther">
            <div>How many blocks would you need to write <code>tree3a</code> out of Motion blocks similarly to how we wrote <code>tree2a</code>?  How about <code>tree4a</code>?</div></div>
