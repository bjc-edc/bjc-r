		<h2>Recursive Tree, Part 1</h2>	
        <p>
            Our goal is to draw a <strong>fractal</strong> tree. Notice that the picture contains smaller versions of itself...<br />
            <div class="sidenoteBig">A <strong>fractal</strong> is a repeating pattern made up of copies (or slight variations) of the same shape.</div>
            <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/full-recursive-tree-BYOB.jpg" alt="simple tree fractal" title="simple tree fractal" /><br />
            You will build up your fractal tree by using scripts within scripts to create the branches that are smaller copies of the same tree.
        </p>
        <!--<p>
           Notice that the tree is like a <em>fractal</em>, a picture that contains smaller versions of itself:<br />
            <div class="sideHOMbig">Technically, all the images in this unit are just <em>approximations</em> to fractals because the smaller pictures are <em>simpler</em> than the complete picture. In real fractals, the smaller pictures are just as complete; the smaller and smaller branches go on forever to matter how much you zoom in. In these projects, you can imagine that we have infinitely many smaller and smaller branches.</div>

        </p>
        <p>We'll create a <code>tree</code> block in Snap<em>!</em> It'll start with a <code>move</code> block to draw the trunk of the tree, then a <code>turn</code> block turning left, then another <code>tree</code> block to draw the left smaller tree, and so on.</p>
        <div class="takeNote">"Wait!" you may be thinking. "How can we use a <code>tree</code> block <em>inside</em> a <code>tree</code> block? It doesn't exist yet!" That's the big idea for this assignment.</div>
        <p>We're going to work up to the complicated tree starting with very simple steps that don't involve <code>tree</code> within <code>tree</code>.</p>-->

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>	
                <li><div class="newProject">	<span class="text">"U6L1-Tree"</span><img src="/bjc-r/img/icons/new-project-called.png" alt="Start a New Project called U6L1-Tree" title="Start a New Project called U6L1-Tree" /></div>
</li>
                <li>
                    Build the first level:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Build this <code>tree1</code> block: <br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/tree1.png" alt="tree level 1 script" title="tree level 1 script" />
                        </li>
                        <li>                    
                        	Point the sprite facing up, put the pen down, and run <code>tree1 size: 50</code>. You should get a result like this: <br />
                    <div class="sidenote">The block <code>tree1 size</code> draws just 1 level of the tree.</div>
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/tree-level1.png" alt="tree level 1 result" title="tree level 1 result" />
                    	</li>
                        <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Where does your sprite start? Where does it stop? <strong>Why?</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
				<!--<p>This looks simple, but it will get interesting soon. The script draws one tree branch and then moves the sprite back to its original position.</p> -->
                <li> 
                    Now, build the second level:
                    <ol>
                    	<li>
                        	Build <code>tree2a</code>, which draws two levels:<br />
                    		<div class="sidenote">You'll make two versions, so this called <code>tree2a</code>.</div>
                    		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/tree2a.png" alt="tree level 2a script" title="tree level 2a script" />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        	Run <code>tree2a size: 50</code>. You should get a result like this:<br />
                        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/tree-level2.jpg" alt="tree level 2a result" title="tree level 2a result" />
                        </li>
						<li>
                        	<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Where does your sprite start? Where does it stop? <strong>Why?</strong> <br />
                        	Trace through the code. Paying close attention to the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks is going to be important.
                    	</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
		
        <div class="takeNote"><strong>State transparency</strong> (changing only what you need to and nothing else) is important when using scripts within scripts. Usually, this means returning the sprite to the same position and direction as it started in.</div>

		<!--<p>At this rate you'll never be able to make the beautiful version of the tree in this century! In the next step, we'll discuss how to simplify this process.</p>
		<div class="takeNote"><div class="commentBig">I think this would be more effective as a discussion listed in the TG. --MF</div>Before going on, make sure that you can mentally trace through the code provided. Paying close attention to the <code>move</code> and <code>turn</code> blocks is going to be important to seeing the big picture<!-- and understanding the recursion- ->. </div>-->
        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <ol type="A">
                <li>How many blue Motion blocks would you need to write <code>tree3a</code> similarly to how we wrote <code>tree2a</code>?</li>
                <li>How about <code>tree4a</code>?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>To write <code>tree3a</code> the way we wrote <code>tree2a</code> would take a lot of blocks! So, we'll use abstraction...</p>
