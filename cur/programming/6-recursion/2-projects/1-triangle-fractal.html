        <p>
        	Now, we'll build another fractal structure by using triangles:<br />

                    First, write a block that takes a <var>size</var> as input and draws a triangle.<br />

        <h3>Triangle Fractal</h3>
        <p>
        	We'll use that <code>triangle</code> block as the base case for a new block with <var>level</var> and <var>size</var> inputs just like <code>tree</code>:<br />

        </p>
        <p>
        	At level 1, the result of should be an equilateral triangle:<br />

        </p>
        <p>
            At level 2, each side of the triangle should be extended with a half-size triangle:<br />

        <p>
            Here are levels 3 and 4:<br />

                    The <code>warp</code> block (in the yellow Control palette) makes the scripts inside it run faster by skipping any intermediate steps and not letting any other scripts run until it's finished.<br />

                        <p>
                            Your finished product should have produced a shape sort of like this:<br />

                        <p>but with lots of small line segments instead of the grey parts. This should suggest an alternate way to make the shape: Level 1 is a triangle, level 2 is three level-1 versions arrayed around an empty triangle, etc. Write the code for that and compare the two results.</p>
                    </li>
                    <div class="todo">I couldn't get the fractal in this second problem right without help from Brian, and it turned out to be that I was being too logical. In the problems above, the smaller triangles were half-size. I assumed that to be the case here (though perhaps I should have assumed third-size)&mdash;especially because the very next problem specifies <span class="katex">\frac{size}{\sqrt{3}}</span>, so obviously that's not what would we want here (but it turns out that's the only factor that gives the level 8 image below.) --MF</div>

                            Okay, no hints this time. Level 1 is an equilateral triangle. Here are levels 2 and 3:<br />

                        <p>
                            And here's level 8:<br />

                        <p>If you compare the level 2 picture with the one from the previous page, you'll see that the basic idea is the same: Stick little triangles at the corners of big ones. But they're stuck together slightly differently.</p>
                    </li>
                    <div class="todo">After Brian corrected me on the <span class="katex">\frac{size}{\sqrt{3}}</span> thing on the problem above and my misinterpretation of the instruction "turn 30 degrees left after drawing each side and before the recursive call" on the problem below to mean that the <code>turn left</code> block should have an input of 30, I now have two identical scripts for these two seemingly separate problems. --MF</div>
                    <li>This time, instead of balancing the smaller triangles symmetrically on the corners of the bigger triangle, turn 30 degrees left after drawing each side and before the recursive call, and use <span class="katex">\frac{size}{\sqrt{3}}</span> as the size in the recursive call. Then make a level-10 fractal inside a <code>warp</code> block.  (Find it in the Control palette.)</li>
