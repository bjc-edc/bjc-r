                <li>Do a quick <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mondrian&ia=images" target="_blank">search for the Dutch painter Mondrian</a>.</li>

            Mondrian's paintings were not created recursively, but we can use recursion to create similar images:<br />
<div class="sidenoteBig">If you look closely at this picture, you'll see that the corners of the outside border are missing.  This happens when you use a wide pen and choose "Flat line ends," as we did for this project.  Don't worry about it.</div>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="2">
                <li>
                	<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
                	Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/6-recursion/U6L2-Mondrian.xml" target="_blank">this project</a>. It has several blocks already created and the script that calls <code>Mondrian</code> already set up.</li>
                <li>
					Begin by programming the code for your base case, the <code>rectangle</code> block. It will need to draw a rectangle with a black border and use a very thick line of color to paint the inside. Be sure to preserve state transparency (put the sprite back where it started).
                	<div class="endnote">The <code>rectangle</code> block already contains two custom blocks, <code>set pen to black line</code>, for the borders, and <code>set pen to paint</code>, which runs a random <code>set pen color</code> block from the <var>colors</var> list and sets the pen width according to the <var>thickness</var> you determine. You can look inside these two custom blocks to see how they work. <var>Colors</var> is set up before the outer call to <code>Mondrian</code>, like this:<br />
                        <img src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/set-colors.png" alt="set (color) to {(set pen color to red), (set pen color to yellow), (set pen color to blue), (set pen color to white), (set pen color to black)}" title="set (color) to {(set pen color to red), (set pen color to yellow), (set pen color to blue), (set pen color to white), (set pen color to black)}" />
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click "r" a few times to be sure you have <code>rectangle</code> set up correctly. Each time, you should get a big rectangle with  one of the five colors inside and a black border, like this:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/mondrian-base-case-animation.gif" alt="Mondrian base case pictures" title="Mondrian base case pictures" />
                </li>
				<li>

						<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/take-turns-speaking-mini.gif" alt="Take turns speaking" title="Take turns speaking">
						Then, program the code for the recursive case. The <code>Mondrian</code> block already contains some structure. Your job is to fill in all the blanks. Before you get started, think carefully about how the script is going to work. 
                        <ul>
							<li>You've already seen level 1, a filled-in rectangle.  For level 2, <code>Mondrian</code> will randomly divide the area specified by its <var>width</var> and <var>height</var> inputs in two pieces, and draw a <code>rectangle</code> in each piece.  For level 3, <code>Mondrian</code> will randomly divide the area in two pieces, and draw a level-2 <code>Mondrian</code> in each piece (for a total of four filled-in rectangles).  Level 4 will create eight rectangles; level 5 will create 16; and so on.</li>
                            <li>The <var>fraction</var> variable will contain a random fraction between 1/5 and 4/5, specifying how to divide up the area at this level.  You'll have to use that fraction to find the scaling factors for the sizes of the two pieces.</li>
                            <li>The algorithm will be slightly different based on whether an area is being divided up along the width or along the height. Notice that the <code>if-else</code> determines whether <var>width</var> or <var>height</var> is greater. Divide each area along the longer side.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Click "space" a few times. When you have <code>Mondrian</code> working, it should look something like this:<br />

                </li>
            </ol>

                	Recursion is not just for <em>commands</em> either. You'll learn about recursive <em>reporters</em> in Unit 7. For example, this block reports the factorial of a number. Can you see how it works?<br />
