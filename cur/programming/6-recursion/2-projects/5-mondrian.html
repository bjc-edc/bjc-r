		<h2>Recursive Mondrian</h2>
        <p>Recursion is not just for fractals...</p>

            Mondrian's paintings were not created recursively, but we can use recursion to create similar images:<br />

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="2">
                <li>
                	<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
                	Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/6-recursion/U6L2-Mondrian.xml" target="_blank">this project</a>. It has several blocks already created and the script that calls <code>Mondrian</code> already set up.</li>
                <li>
					Begin by programming the code for your base case, the <code>rectangle</code> block. It will need to draw a rectangle with a black border and use a very thick line of color to paint the inside. Be sure to preserve state transparency (put the sprite back where it started).
                	<div class="endnote">The <code>rectangle</code> block already contains two custom blocks, <code>set pen to black line</code>, for the borders, and <code>set pen to paint</code>, which runs a random <code>set pen color</code> block from the <var>colors</var> list variable according to the <var>thickness</var> you determine. You can look inside these two custom blocks to see how they work.<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/set-colors.png" alt="set (color) to {(set pen color to red), (set pen color to yellow), (set pen color to blue), (set pen color to white), (set pen color to black)}" title="set (color) to {(set pen color to red), (set pen color to yellow), (set pen color to blue), (set pen color to white), (set pen color to black)}" />
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click "r" a few times to be sure you have <code>rectangle</code> set up correctly. Each time, you should get a big rectangle with  one of the five colors inside and a black border, like this:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/mondrian-base-case-animation.gif" alt="Mondrian base case pictures" title="Mondrian base case pictures" />
                </li>
				<li>
                    <p>
						<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/take-turns-speaking-mini.gif" alt="Take turns speaking" title="Take turns speaking">
						Then, program the code for the recursive case. The <code>Mondrian</code> block already contains some structure. Your job is to fill in all the blanks. Before you get started, think carefully about how the script is going to work. 
                        <ul>
							<li>You've already seen level 1. For level 2, <code>Mondrian</code> will randomly divide the rectangle into two pieces and draw a rectangle on each side. For level 3, <code>Mondrian</code> will randomly divide the rectangle into two pieces, randomly divide each of <em>those</em> two pieces into two pieces each, and then draw a rectangle in each of those four places. Level 4 will create eight rectangles, level 5 will create sixteen, and so on.</li>
                            <li>The <var>percent</var> variable gives a random percentage for how to divide up the rectangle each time. You'll have to determine how to calculate the lengths of the rectangles. (For example, if we are dividing a width of 200 with a percentage of 40%, we'll have a rectangle of width 80 and one of 120, and their heights will be the same).</li>
                            <li>The algorithm will be slightly different based on whether a rectangle is being divided up along the width or along the height. Notice that the <code>if-else</code> determines whether <var>width</var> or <var>height</var> is greater. Divide each rectangle along the longer side.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Click "space" a few times. When you have <code>Mondrian</code> working, it should look something like this:<br />

                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
		<div class="ifTime">
            <ol start="7">
            	<li>
                	Recursion is not just for <em>commands</em> either. You'll learn about recursive <em>reporters</em> in Unit 7. For example, this block reports the factorial of a number. Can you see how it works?<br />
