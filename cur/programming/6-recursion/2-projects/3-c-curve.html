		<h2>Lévy C-Curve Fractal</h2>
        <div class="sidenote">Lévy is pronounced LEH-vee.</div>
        <div class="todo">
            <ul>
                <li>GH Feedback 8/4/15: I like this program. I needed Brian Harvey's help to understand the fractal and thus be able to write this program. I know it sounds silly, but the colors threw me off! The base level was red and the next level is a red and blue corner. The next level should be the red and blue corner and then ANOTHER red and blue corner. The coloring messed with my noggin.</li>
                <li>I still need to rebuild these images, but I'm not going to change them fundamentally since we adapted the coloring on the previous page to match this... --MF</li>

        <p>
            Another well-known recursive shape is the Lévy C-curve. As in the snowflake algorithm, the base case is that the sprite draws a single line segment, starting on the left, going to the right, and pointing in the same direction in the beginning and at the end (to the right).<br />

        </p>
        <p>
        	In the second level, the sprite repeats the previous level twice&mdash;first turning 45&deg; left, then doing the previous level, then turning 90&deg; right, then doing the previous level again, and finally turning 45&deg; left to face the same direction again. You'll have to think about how much smaller the <var>size</var> input should be in the recursive calls.<br />

 If the size of one level of the program is held by the variable <var>size</var>, what is the size passed through the recursive call to the next-lowest level? Use the Pythagorean formula: <span class="katex">a^2 + b^2 = c^2</span>.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
        	In the third level, the sprite repeats the previous level twice, drawing 4 smaller lines. Notice that the 2nd and 3rd lines are in the same direction (they are <em>collinear</em>) so they appear to be one connected longer line.<br />

                    What in the algorithm makes these two lines end up drawn at the same angle?

                        Recall, the algorithm for each recursive level is: 
                        <ul>
                        	<li>turn 45&deg; left</li>
                            <li>recursively call the previous level at the smaller size</li>
                            <li>turn 90&deg; right</li>
                            <li>recursively call the previous level at the smaller size</li>
                            <li>turn 45&deg; left</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </li>
