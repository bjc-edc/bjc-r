        <div class="todo">This link is confusing, and I don't think it works as intended. The href is to duckduckgo, but clicking it goes to google; and the sidenote says duckduckgo, but the link text says google. Please correct. --MF</div>
        <p>Now that you've seen what kind of beautiful fractals you can make with a computer, check out these amazing ones found in nature!</p>
 		<div class="sidenoteBig">DuckDuckGo is a search engine, like Google, except that it doesn't keep records of all your searches in order to sell you to advertisers.</div>       
		<p><a href='https://duckduckgo.com?q="fractals in nature !gi"' target="_blank">Google image search for fractals in nature</a>.</p>
		<p>There are some beautiful examples of recursive patterns in nature; see, for instance, <a href="http://www.rainbowskill.com/canteen/beautiful-fractals.php" target="_blank">this collection</a>.</p>
