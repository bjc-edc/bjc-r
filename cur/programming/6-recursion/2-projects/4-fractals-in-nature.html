		<h2>Fractals in Nature</h2>
        <p>The  computer-generated landscapes and clouds you see in Pixar (and other) films are fractals. Now that you've made some fractal structures yourself, check out those found in nature.</p>

              In nature, gravity affects how plants grow. Here is an example of the tree fractal that uses a <code>gravity</code> block to weigh down the branches  roughly the way gravity would. This tree's branching structure looks like <img src="/bjc-r-2017-18/img/6-recursion/tree-with-bent-trunk.png"  height="165" alt="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge">. The image below shows what happens when we add gravity. Experiment with this idea or work on whatever alternative you find interesting and beautiful.<br />
