        <p>War</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Explain: "War is all about technology" - in what ways is war related to technology? 
        	  <ul>
        	    <li>Who wins a war is largely determined by technology, more than by the size of armies, etc. Students may know the example of the importance of metal-clad warships in the Civil War.
        	      <ul>
        	        <li>New technology changes the rules. For a long time you could make a clear distinction between soldiers and civilians, and just do battle with soldiers. But the ability to drop bombs from airplanes undid that.</li>

                	<li>Name some jobs that didn't exist 25 years ago.</li>
                    <li>Name some jobs that existed 25 years ago that no longer exist today (or at least mostly don't exist today).</li>
                    <li>Name some jobs that don't exist today that you think might exist in 25 years.</li>
