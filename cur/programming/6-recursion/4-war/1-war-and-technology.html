                <li>Explain: "War is all about technology" - in what ways is war related to technology? 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who wins a war is largely determined by technology, more than by the size of armies, etc. Students may know the example of the importance of metal-clad warships in the Civil War.

                                <li>New technology changes the rules. For a long time you could make a clear distinction between soldiers and civilians, and just do battle with soldiers. But the ability to drop bombs from airplanes undid that.</li>

		<p>Technology affects real wars, too.  When the two sides have similar weapon technology, the outcome of battles may be decided by numbers of soldiers, the strategies of generals, and other human factors.  But if one side has better technology, they win.  For example, that's how a handful of European explorers were able to defeat the vastly more numerous Native American population:  The Europeans had guns.</p>
