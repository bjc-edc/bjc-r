            <li>Drones! The key point in this whole topic is that the ability to conduct war from home eliminates the human cost (i.e., dead Americans), which is what voters care about, and therefore make it much easier for a president to choose to go to war overseas without worrying about political consequences. This is really different from previous weapons technologies.<ul><li>We can't say that "dead Americans...is what voters care about." Not only is that cynical, but it's also not true. Plenty of voters care about hurting people of any nationality and would prefer to resolve conflicts without war. --MF

                    <li>Sorry, Mary, but it's neither cynical nor untrue. If it would make you happier, we could say &quot;most voters.&quot; But, for example, never mind the Republicans, all the Democrats who prefer Clinton over Sanders are people who don't care <em>enough</em> about non-American lives to think that being a super hawk should disqualify a candidate for president. Sure, many people say they love peace in the abstract, but there's a ton of research about this, and nobody gets voted out of office for warmaking unless American lives are lost. That's what all the &quot;boots on the ground&quot; nonsense is about! And we <em>have</em> to say so, because people  (at least people who do care about peace) <em>need to know</em> that this is a crucial way in which drones change warfare. They make it cost-free for politicians. --bh</li>
