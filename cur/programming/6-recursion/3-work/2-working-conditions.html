    	<h2>Working Conditions</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
        
        <ul>
        	<li>Put these in TG: 
        	  <ul>
        	    <li>The canonical example is people who take phone calls from customers at big companies (including Directory Assistance operators at the phone company). Their workstations collect information about how long it takes each worker to handle a call, on average, and also on how well the customer rates the worker. Managers see all this information in real time and can yell at slow or surly workers.</li>
        	    <li>Some employers put key-card locks on the rest rooms, so their computers can collect information on who takes a lot of bathroom breaks.</li>
        	    <li>Uber competes with licensed taxis, without having to follow the licensing rules; some cities have banned them for this reason. Uber drivers are considered independent contractors, so Uber doesn't have to provide health insurance or unemployment compensation, and yet arguably Uber determines their conditions of work, so they <em>should</em> be employees. (All this has to be explained in a way understandable to students of course.)</li>
        	    <li>It <em>is</em> possible to use computers in ways that improve the conditions of work. Scandinavian countries, in which, by law, unions must be represented on corporate boards of directors, have experimented along these lines. The idea is to set up computer systems that give the worker the right information at the right time, without telling the worker what to do.</li>
       	      </ul>
        
        <p>For students, have them... Think about ways that technology can be used by bosses to micro-manage their employees. (ie put yourself in the position of a boss). Or think of ways technology can help workers (what systems you might implement as a "good" boss).</p>
        <p>Is there anything students can read on this?</p>
        <p>Also not just in terms of boss... Other ideas for changing working conditions?</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Computers can affect the <em>style</em> of work, even if they don't take your job away.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<ol>
            	<li>With a partner, brainstorm some possible answers, then share them with the class.
                <ul>
                	<li>Name some jobs that didn't exist 25 years ago.</li>
                    <li>Name some jobs that existed 25 years ago that no longer exist today (or at least mostly don't exist today).</li>
                    <li>Name some jobs that don't exist today that you think might exist in 25 years.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
