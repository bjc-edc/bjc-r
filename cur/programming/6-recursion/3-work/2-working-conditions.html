        <p>For students, have them... Think about ways that technology can be used by bosses to micro-manage their employees. (ie put yourself in the position of a boss). Or think of ways technology can help workers (what systems you might implement as a "good" boss).</p>
        <p>Good questions from random site <a href="https://www.littler.com/events/controlling-employee-personal-behavior-age-social-media-and-personal-technology">Littler</a></p>

            	<div class="sidenote">Here are some findings from a <a href="http://www.amanet.org/training/articles/the-latest-on-workplace-monitoring-and-surveillance.aspx" target="_blank">2007 Electronic Monitoring and Surveillance Survey"</a>.</div>
            	<li>Here are some ways employers use technology to monitor their employees. What are some pros and cons of these policies?
                <ul>
                	<li>Block access to certain websites, for example social media sites (like Facebook or Twitter), game sites, or other inappropriate/offensive sites.</li>
                    <li>Monitor email use of employees, including reading email messages.</li>
                    <li>Video surveillance to prevent theft.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Technology has enabled the growth of an ''on-demand economy'' (this existed before the Internet, but technology has helped it grow). One feature of many of these on-demand companies is that they do not have employees, but rather hire independent contractors. This means that workers can be very flexible in when they work, but they also do not get the benefits of being employees like sick-pay, health insurance, job stability, or unemployment benefits if they are fired.
                <ul>
                	<li>Do some research about the on-demand economy. Here are some sites and articles to get you started.

                    <li>Do you agree or disagree? Discuss some of these features of on-demand companies.
                    <ul>
                    	<li>On-demand workers know what they're signing up for, so they shouldn't be suing these companies for not getting benefits.</li>
                        <li>In general, you get better work out of people if they are dedicated and loyal to your company (i.e., what happens when a driver drives for both Uber and Lyft?)</li>
                        <li>The on-demand economy just helps the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.</li>
                        <li>It is hard for a traditional company with employees to compete with the on-demand model.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Think of an idea for an on-demand company you might launch.</li>
                </ul>
