    	<h2>Working Remotely</h2>

            	<div class="sidenote">This study found that <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home" target="_blank">productivity increased for call-center workers working from home over a period of nine months</a>.</div>
            	<li>Working remotely usually refers to employees who telecommute (work from home instead of coming to an office). Not all employers allow their employees to telecommute.
                <ul>
                	<li>As an employer, what reasons would you give for not wanting your employees to telecommute?</li>
                    <li>As an employer, what benefits might there be for allowing employees the option to telecommute?</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>There are other interesting ways that technology enables workers to work from afar. Choose one or more of these topics to research and discuss.
                <ul>
                    <li>Technology can help doctors treat patients remotely. This can be especially useful for clinics in rural areas, or for helping more people access doctors who specialize in the areas they need. Other developments in technology are helping doctors monitor vital signs or perform surgery using robots. Search for articles about telemedicine to learn about its benefits and potential downsides.</li>
                    <li>Farming can't be done remotely. So how is technology affecting agriculture? One way is by empowering agricultural workers by providing them with real-time information, such as market prices for food and animals, so that they are aware of fair prices. Another way is to help workers sell their products by finding customers. Read about new initiatives and their challenges in countries all over the world. For example: <a href="http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2013/11/top-10-mobile-agriculture-applications/" target="_blank">Top 10 mobile agricultural applications (IT News Africa)</a> or <a href="http://www.scidev.net/south-asia/agriculture/news/smartphone-app-helps-nepali-farmers.html" target="_blank">Smartphone app helps Nepali farmers (SciDev.net)</a> or <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/07/02/code-for-the-caribbean-fellows-partner-with-local-agencies-to-design-two-awesome-apps/" target="_blank">Code for the Caribbean Fellows Partner with Local Agency to Design Two Awesome Apps</a></li>
                    <li>Outsourcing is paying others to perform tasks or provide services at a lower price that it would cost to do them yourself. For example, companies often outsource certain tasks to other companies. Sometimes (not always), these companies are in other countries where people are generally paid less. Technology has made outsourcing easier, and it's not just companies, but individuals who outsource parts of their lives. Search for articles about personal outsourcing to read about personal outsourcing companies and people who use them. For example: <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/average-joes-janes-outsourcing-tasks/" target="_blank">Average Joes, Janes Outsourcing Tasks (CBS News)</a> or <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118073815238422013" target="_blank">Outsourcing Your Life (Wall Street Journal)</a>. You can also learn about <a href="http://mturk.com" target="_blank">Amazon's Mechanical Turk</a>, a forum that pays humans to do tasks that computers cannot do. They call them ''Human Intelligence Tasks'' (HITs), and people who perform these tasks successfully are paid, generally very low amounts.</li>
