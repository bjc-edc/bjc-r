    	<h2>Working Remotely</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
		<ul>
        	<li>Computers affect the distribution of jobs among communities by enabling long-distance work. This is why customer service operators often have Indian accents these days: They're really in India! This is good for Indian workers but not so good for American workers. Even intellectual work -- in particular, even computer programming -- can be outsourced. Cf. Amazon Mechanical Turk. (There was a news story about somebody who got hired as a programmer in the US and used Mechanical Turk to outsource his entire job, since programmers in India aren't paid as much as ones in the US. I think he got found out eventually.)
        	  <ul>
        	    <li>Sometimes computer-mediated outsourcing is a social good for reasons that aren't directly economic, such as the provision of medical care in remote rural areas by doctors in the city plus nurses in the remote areas.</li>
       	      </ul>
        	</li>
        	<li>Rural third-world farmers benefit from the ability to get up-to-date food prices in the big city, so that the wholesalers who bring their produce to the city don't take advantage of them in price negotiation.</li>
            </ul>

            	<li>With a partner, brainstorm some possible answers, then share them with the class.
                <ul>
                	<li>Name some jobs that didn't exist 25 years ago.</li>
                    <li>Name some jobs that existed 25 years ago that no longer exist today (or at least mostly don't exist today).</li>
                    <li>Name some jobs that don't exist today that you think might exist in 25 years.</li>
                </ul>
