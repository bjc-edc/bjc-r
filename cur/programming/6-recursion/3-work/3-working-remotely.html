    	<h2>Working Remotely</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
		<ul>
        	<li>Computers affect the distribution of jobs among communities by enabling long-distance work. This is why customer service operators often have Indian accents these days: They're really in India! This is good for Indian workers but not so good for American workers. Even intellectual work -- in particular, even computer programming -- can be outsourced. Cf. Amazon Mechanical Turk. (There was a news story about somebody who got hired as a programmer in the US and used Mechanical Turk to outsource his entire job, since programmers in India aren't paid as much as ones in the US. I think he got found out eventually.)
        	  <ul>
        	    <li>Sometimes computer-mediated outsourcing is a social good for reasons that aren't directly economic, such as the provision of medical care in remote rural areas by doctors in the city plus nurses in the remote areas.</li>
       	      </ul>
        	</li>
        	<li>Rural third-world farmers benefit from the ability to get up-to-date food prices in the big city, so that the wholesalers who bring their produce to the city don't take advantage of them in price negotiation.</li>
            </ul>

            	<li>Working remotely usually refers to employees who telecommute (work from home instead of coming to an office). Not all employers allow their employees to telecommute.
                <ul>
                	<li>As an employer, what reasons would you give for not wanting your employees to telecommute?</li>
                    <li>As an employer, what benefits might there be for allowing employees the option to telecommute?</li>

                <li>There are other interesting ways that technology enables workers to work from afar. Choose one or more of these topics to research and discuss.

                	<li><a href="http://mturk.com" target="_blank">Amazon's Mechanical Turk</a> is a forum that pays humans to do tasks that computers cannot do. They call them "Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs), and people who perform these tasks successfully are paid, generally very low amounts. Search for articles about the site to find out why people do this, who does it, and some of the consequences for workers and for companies and organizations that submit the requests.</li>
