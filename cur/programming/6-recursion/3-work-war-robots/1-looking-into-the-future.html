    	<h2>Looking to the Past and Future</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
        <p>JK: Just brainstorming about this lab</p>
        <p>Work</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Could ask students to name jobs that didn't exist 25 years ago; name jobs that existed 25 years ago that no longer exist (or have virtually disappeared); name jobs of the future that don't exist yet.</li>
        	<li>What are some jobs that computers will "never" be able to do?</li>
        	<li>What are some dangerous/impossible jobs that humans couldn't previously do, but computers can make possible. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cockroach-like-robots-may-be-the-future-of-disaster-help/" target="_blank">Cockroach-ish disaster robots</a> <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/3031657/robotics/navy-calls-on-researchers-to-create-firefighting-humanoid-robot.html" target="_blank">Firefighting robots</a> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/600779/artificial-intelligence-offers-a-better-way-to-diagnose-malaria/" target="_blank">or stuff computers are just better at</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>War</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Explain: "War is all about technology" - in what ways is war related to technology? How have we benefited from technologies developed for war (nuclear energy, space race, GPS, drones)</li>
            <li>Autonomous weapons. This <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/01/25/if-killer-robots-arrive-the-terminator-will-be-the-least-of-our-problems/" target="_blank">article about killer robots</a>. <a href="http://futureoflife.org/open-letter-autonomous-weapons/" target="_blank">open letter about autonomous weapons</a></li>
            <li>DARPA</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Robots and Artificial Intelligence</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>What are some challenges that computers have in displaying human intelligence? Maybe also just about robots in general? (even just the challenge robots have in not falling over) <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/honda-using-experimental-asimo-for-disaster-research" target="_blank">Here's one climbing a ladder</a> Just thinking about stuff like <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-ai-gets-better-at-seeing-the-world-by-learning-what-to-focus-on/" target="_blank">learning to see</a>along with stuff like emotions, love. Hm. My meandering took me to this interesting article: <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/SHR/4-2/text/hofstadter.html" target="_blank">On seeing A's and seeing As</a></li>
            <li>Research - look up and read about some recent breakthroughs in AI</li>
            <li>How does AI force us to redefine certain ideas? Relatively tame example: <a href="http://www.eweek.com/mobile/googles-ai-system-is-the-driver-in-self-driving-cars-nhtsa-rules.html" target="_blank">Needing to redefine "driver"</a>. Also need to define what it means to be "human"...<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/study-nobody-wants-social-robots-that-look-like-humans" target="_blank">humanoid robots</a> <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/the-uncanny-valley" target="_blank">Uncanny valley</a></li>
            <li>Write/debate/discuss - ideas like limits to developing robots, what could go wrong?, humans being surpassed by robots</li>
        </ul>

        	<ol>
            	<li>With a partner, brainstorm some possible answers, then share them with the class.
                <ul>
                	<li>Name some jobs that didn't exist 25 years ago.</li>
                    <li>Name some jobs that existed 25 years ago that no longer exist today (or at least mostly don't exist today).</li>
                    <li>Name some jobs that don't exist today that you think might exist in 25 years.</li>
                </ul>
