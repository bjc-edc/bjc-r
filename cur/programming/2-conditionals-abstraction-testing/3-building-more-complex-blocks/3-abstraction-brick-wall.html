		<h2>Abstraction: Brick Wall and Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <ul>
                <li>MF: I remember when I studied PHP and MySQL from a PeachPit Press book that every snippet of code in the book and project I worked on was about something relevent to an actual scenario one might run into when building a website. I don't get that feeling here. I wonder if we might want to consider having overarching projects for each unit. So that a little U2L8 "draw a brick wall" excercise doesn't feel so pointless, but instead is part of building an animation or something where characters (or bugs) ;) dance about in front of a brick wall. Then there is a point to doing this: building the backdrop for the animation.</li>
                <li>MF: Also, we need to be really careful about language with this one. Bricks are not blocks, yet we say, "to draw the mortar (the white space) between blocks in a row" and that seems very likely to confuse someone more than just me. Do we mean block or brick here?</li>
                <li>MF: Perhaps we want to say more about what mortar is than just "white space." I mean, I wouldn't expect every high school kid to know what it is, and it certainly is not <em>really</em> "white space" in the (so-called) real-world.</li>  
                <li>GitHub Feedback:
                	<ul>
                        <li>The save work should happen before the "Take it further"</li>
                        <li>Tic-Tac-Toe should really be a separate page. Brick Wall is already a kind of long exercise. The numbering shouldn't start at 8 since it's a separate thing.</li>
                        <li>Use spaces in recommended file names since it's easier to read. (Or do we really need to tell students the name of their files?)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

    	<p>Designing a program to draw this picture—a brick wall that you might later use as a stage background in some program you write—is good practice in analyzing structure.</p>

        <h3>Abstraction</h3>
		<p>While any good programming language might have many tools for drawing and moving, it wouldn't make sense to have special tools for drawing bricks because most programs don't involve bricks. That is the sort of tool you make yourself when you need it.  When you need to draw bricks, having a special <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick.png" alt="draw-brick" /> block lets your code use terms directly related to the problem you are trying to solve, rather than the more general-purpose terms that the computer uses for all kinds of tasks. The process of moving from what the programming language gives you to a natural language (one that humans speak to communicate) is a key part of  good abstraction.</p>
		<p>In this problem, you will build an abstraction for drawing a brick wall, first by creating <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick.png" alt="draw-brick" />, then blocks for drawing rows, and ultimately the goal: <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick-wall-num.png" alt="draw-brick-wall-n" />.</p>

        <h3>Drawing One Brick</h3>
        <p>A picture of  a brick is rectangle, filled in "brick red"  (darker than the primary-color red).  There's no <code>draw rectangle</code> block in <span class="snap">snap</span>. One way to fake it is by thinking of a rectangle as a very thick line.</p>
        <img border="0" class="indent" title="code for brick" alt="Code for draw brick" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick-code.png" />

            	<li>Try out this block.  
               	  <div class="endnote">If your "brick" has rounded ends, remember that you can <a href=" bjc-r/cur/programming/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/2-script-variables/2-script-variable-projects.html"> change how lines are drawn </a> by clicking the settings button (<img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/settings.png" alt="settings button" />) in the toolbar, and turning on  "Flat line ends." Rounded ends stick out beyond the length of the line you asked to draw.  Here's a picture of the rounded brick with a regular  line (pen size 1) inside it:

       			  <p>These rounded ends are better for most line drawings, but not for this purpose.</p>

        <h3>Using Problem Decomposition to Write an Abstraction</h3>
		<p> You'd like the &quot;top level&quot; block to be something like this:</p>
		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick-wall-7.png" alt="draw-brick-wall-7" />
		<p> A human brick-layer  would  understand exactly how to build such a wall. A compute, doesn't know, so you must fill in the details. This means going from the abstract (draw a brick wall) to the concrete (pardon the pun). This involves <strong>problem decomposition</strong>.</p>
		<p>There are two kinds of rows, so we make blocks that specialize in each:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Row A</strong>: <img border="0" title="Row A" alt="Row A" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/row-a.png" /></li>
			<li><strong>Row B</strong>: <img border="0" title="Row B" alt="Row B" src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/row-b.png" /></li>
		</ul>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
        	<ol start="2">
            	<li>Make blocks <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/rowa-block.png" alt="Row A" /> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/rowb-block.png" alt="Row B" />.</li>
            	<li>Think about what helper blocks besides <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick.png" alt="Draw Brick" /> you might want.</li>
            
        <div class="takeNote"> 
          <p><strong>Too much abstraction? </strong>It's possible to go overboard on abstraction and build so many blocks that your program is just as cluttered as it would be without the special blocks. </p>
          <p>But it can also be useful to make a special block even when its definition is just one built-in block. For example, to draw the mortar (the cement between bricks, shown  as white space), you can just use <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/move4.png" alt="Move 4 Steps">, but it might make sense to define a <code>draw mortar</code> block. </p>
          <p>Why? You might later decide that 4 steps is the wrong thickness for mortar, and you'd rather have 5. Or you might want the mortar to be  cement-colored, slightly gray. With many <code>move</code> blocks scattered through your program, you would have to find and change each one, and keep putting in <code>set pen color</code> blocks. With a <code>draw mortar</code> block, you can just change its definition, and all the mortar in your picture will be changed.</p>
        </div>
            	<li>
                	<p>The two kinds of rows should be exactly the same length.  Your first try at drawing  Row B may be a little too long. If so, think through what causes that bug.</p>
					<p>How are you going to fix it? Should  Row B have different-size bricks, different-size mortar gaps, or different-size half-bricks? If you're not sure, try all the possibilities and see which looks right in the finished wall. Or think &quot;What would <em>make most sense</em> in a <em>real</em> brick wall?&quot;</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>Once you have  rows A and B the same length, you can write the <img src="/bjc-r/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick-wall-num.png" alt="Draw a Brick Wall with ( ) Rows" /> block.  Make sure that it  works sensibly for both even and odd numbers of rows.</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="takeItFurther"><a name="further" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>
                	<p>After you've drawn the picture at the top of this page, add more
        inputs to the <code>Draw a Brick Wall</code> block:<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Would be a Good Time to Save" title="Now Would be a Good Time to Save" /></p>
        			<ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
                    	<li>Length of the wall (how many bricks)</li>
				        <li>Length of a brick</li>
				        <li>Mortar thickness</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p> Add these one at a time, not all at once!  When you modify the length of a brick, that should also change the length of a half-brick. When you modify the mortar thickness, that should also change the distance between rows (since that's mortar too). </p>

			<p><strong>Practice abstraction: </strong> Over time, you will program the computer to play tic-tac-toe with a person. For now, start just with the board.</p>

                    	Below is some code to draw a tic-tac-toe board. It works, but it's ugly. Your goal is to create blocks that make this code simpler. Don't bother building this script first. You may decide not to use any of it.<br />

                            	Use the same strategy you used above: building meaningful sub-tasks. Let each sub-block <em>specialize</em> in a task and have a name that says clearly what it does. Your goal is to make your code easy to read and understand. Ideally, your resulting <code>draw tic-tac-toe board</code> will read naturally, like the language you would use to a person.
