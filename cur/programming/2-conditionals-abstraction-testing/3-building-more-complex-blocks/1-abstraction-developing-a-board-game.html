		<h2>Abstraction: developing a board game</h2>

                <li>GitHub Feedback:
                	<ul>
                        <li>The 3 blocks should be shown with numeric inputs</li>
                        <li>It's not clear what the inputs to each block should represent. Particularly, the size parameter really ought to be named. The big advantage of Snap! is that we can have a mix of inputs and the function name.</li>
                        <li>I also really thing that this only needs to be 2 blocks: draw tile and draw board. There's not always a "right" level of abstraction, but usually it's perfectly fine to skip the row style functions when working with 2D type data.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, if these blocks are actually drawing (i.e. include pen down) then they should be the pen color.</li>
						<li><strong>GH feedback:</strong> Using three blocks, <br />Should read more clearly as<br />Using three blocks that you develop...<br />Went looking for a while?</li>

                <li>Build three blocks: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/tile(size).png" alt="tile (with input)" title="tile (with input)" /> with an input for size, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/row(tiles,size).png" alt="row of tiles (with two inputs)" title="row of tiles (with two inputs)" /> with inputs for number and size of tiles, and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles,size).png" alt="nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles,size)"> with inputs for number and size of tiles. That is, build a program that allows you to draw a square array of a specified number of square tiles of a specified by building the row and tile blocks first. For example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles3,size100).png" alt="n by n array of tiles with input for number of tiles per row and size of tiles"> draws this:

				</li>
                <li>
                  <p>Test it to make sure that it can make 4x4 arrays and 5x5 arrays, and that the size of the tiles can be controlled.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Build the beginnings of a game. 
                	<ol>
                    	<li> Create a <code>calculate tile size</code> block that figures out what <em>size</em> each tile must be to center an n-by-n board on the stage and make the entire n-by-n board fit well. Use that <code>calculate tile size</code> block in a <code>draw n-by-n board</code> block like this:
                        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/draw-n-by-n-board(n).png" alt="draw an n-by-n board that fits within a 300 by 300 space centered on the stage">. </p></li>
                        <li> Build a reporter <code>on the board?</code> that uses your <code>between?</code> block to report <code>true</code> if the sprite is on the board, and reports <code>false</code> if the sprite is dragged completely off the board.</li>
                        <li> Now build <code>which cell?</code> that tells which cell the sprite has been dragged into. <div class="sidenote">There are many ways to write <code>which row?</code> and <code>which column?</code> You can, of course, use lots of <code>if</code> statements, but since the number of rows can change, it's hard to know how many to use. One convenient way is to divide the total size of the game board by the size of each cell. To use that result, you need to round down. <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/round-a-number.png" alt="round a number"> can do it, but it rounds to the <em>nearest</em> integer, up <em>or</em> down. The function <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/floor of number.png" alt="floor of number"> always rounds <em>down</em>, making it easier to use. The <code>floor</code> function is in the same block as <code>sqrt</code>.</div>
                          Here is one way to do it that uses two other blocks that specialize in reporting <code>which column?</code> and <code>which row?</code> the sprite is in.
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/which-cell(n) without computation.png" alt="partial script for &quot;which-cell?&quot; reporter"></p>
                          <p>These blocks will, of course, need to know how many rows and columns there were, so they'll need the input <code>n</code>.</p></li>
                        <li>Here's a block that you can use to test how well your other blocks work together.

                        <p>Try it out for boards of different sizes.</p></li>
