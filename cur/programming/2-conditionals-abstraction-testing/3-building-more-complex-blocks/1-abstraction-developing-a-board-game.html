		<h2>Abstraction: developing a board game</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <ul>
                <li>GitHub Feedback:
                	<ul>
                        <li>The 3 blocks should be shown with numeric inputs</li>
                        <li>It's not clear what the inputs to each block should represent. Particularly, the size parameter really ought to be named. The big advantage of Snap! is that we can have a mix of inputs and the function name.</li>
                        <li>I also really thing that this only needs to be 2 blocks: draw tile and draw board. There's not always a "right" level of abstraction, but usually it's perfectly fine to skip the row style functions when working with 2D type data.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, if these blocks are actually drawing (i.e. include pen down) then they should be the pen color.</li>
						<li><strong>GH feedback:</strong> Using three blocks, <br />Should read more clearly as<br />Using three blocks that you develop...<br />Went looking for a while?</li>

                <li>Many board games are played on a square array of tiles. The goal now is to build a block that lets you draw boards with various numbers of tiles, fitting neatly on the stage. For example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/draw-n-by-n-board(3).png"  alt="draw-n-by-n-board(3)"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/draw-n-by-n-board(5).png" alt="draw-n-by-n-board(5)">  should draw these boards:
                  <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/3x3array-of-squares-on-stage.png" width="260" alt="3x3array-of-squares-on-stage"><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/5x5array-of-squares-on-stage.png" width="260" alt="5x5array-of-squares-on-stage"></p>
                  <p>The task is complex, so build specialists that accomplish part of the task and then put them together. For example, you might start by building:</p>
                  <ol> 
                  	<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/tile(size).png" alt="tile of size (size)">, which just takes a size and makes a single square.</li>
                  	<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/row(tiles,size).png" alt="row of">, which uses <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/tile(size).png" alt="tile of size (size)"> to draw a single row of the given number of tiles, like this: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Row-of-5-tiles.png" alt="row of 5 tiles"></li>
                  	<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles-3,size-100).png"  alt="nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles-3,size-100)">, which draws <em>n</em> rows using <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/row(tiles,size).png" alt="row of">.</li>
                  	<li>And, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/calculate-tile-size.png" alt="calculate tile size"> which can be used in <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles-3,size-calculated-to-fit-3-by-3).png" alt="nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles-3,size-calculated-to-fit-3-by-3)"> to make sure the entire board fits.</li>
                  </ol>
                 <p>Test each block by itself before building a block that uses it.</p>
				</li>
                
                <li>If you have not already done it, now create <code>draw n-by-n board</code>. <em><strong>UNEDITED FROM HERE ON</strong></em><strong></strong></li>
                <li> Now build some tools you might need for a game. 
                	<ol>
                    	<li> Create a <code>calculate tile size</code> block that figures out what <em>size</em> each tile must be to center an n-by-n board on the stage and make the entire n-by-n board fit well. Use that <code>calculate tile size</code> block in a <code>draw n-by-n board</code> block like this:
                        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/draw-n-by-n-board(n).png" alt="draw an n-by-n board that fits within a 300 by 300 space centered on the stage">. </p></li>
                        <li> Build a reporter <code>on the board?</code> that uses your <code>between?</code> block to report <code>true</code> if the sprite is on the board, and reports <code>false</code> if the sprite is dragged completely off the board.</li>
                        <li> Now build <code>which cell?</code> that tells which cell the sprite has been dragged into. <div class="sidenote">There are many ways to write <code>which row?</code> and <code>which column?</code> You can, of course, use lots of <code>if</code> statements, but since the number of rows can change, it's hard to know how many to use. One convenient way is to divide the total size of the game board by the size of each cell. To use that result, you need to round down. <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/round-a-number.png" alt="round a number"> can do it, but it rounds to the <em>nearest</em> integer, up <em>or</em> down. The function <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/floor of number.png" alt="floor of number"> always rounds <em>down</em>, making it easier to use. The <code>floor</code> function is in the same block as <code>sqrt</code>.</div>
                          Here is one way to do it that uses two other blocks that specialize in reporting <code>which column?</code> and <code>which row?</code> the sprite is in.
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/which-cell(n) without computation.png" alt="partial script for &quot;which-cell?&quot; reporter"></p>
                          <p>These blocks will, of course, need to know how many rows and columns there were, so they'll need the input <code>n</code>.</p></li>
                        <li>Here's a block that you can use to test how well your other blocks work together.
                        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/play-on-n-by-n-board.png" alt="play on n-by-n board">  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/play-on-n-by-n-board.gif" alt="animation of play"></p>
                        <p>Try it out for boards of different sizes.</p></li>
