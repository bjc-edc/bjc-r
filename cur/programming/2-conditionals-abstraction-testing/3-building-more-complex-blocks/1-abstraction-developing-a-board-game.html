            <ol>
                <li>Using three blocks, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/tile(size).png" alt="tile, with input for size">, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/row(tiles,size).png" alt="row of tiles (with inputs for number  and size of tiles)">, and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles,size).png" alt="nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles,size)">, build a program that allows you to draw a square array of a specified number of square tiles of a specified size. For example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/nxn-array-of-tiles(tiles3,size100).png" alt="n by n array of tiles with input for number of tiles per row and size of tiles"> draws this:

                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
              </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Test it to make sure that it can make 4x4 arrays and 5x5 arrays, and that the size of the tiles can be controlled.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Build the beginnings of a game. 
                	<ol>
                    	<li> Set your sprite to (-150, 150), clear the stage, and run

                        <li> Build a reporter <code>where?</code> that uses your <code>between?</code> block to report <strong>5</strong> if the sprite is dragged into the center cell and <strong>0</strong> if it is not in the center cell. </li>
                        <li>Click on Make a variable and name it <code>which tile?</code>.
                          <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Make-a-variable(tile).png" alt="Make a variable"></p>
                          <p>That will automatically give you a watcher to display its value on the stage.</p>
                         </li>
                        <li> Build a block <code>display the tile</code> that uses <code>where?</code> to <code>set</code> the variable <code>which tile?</code>. Use <code>forever</code> to make it <em>keep</em> reporting (and setting <code>which tile?</code>) as you drag the sprite around the stage. 
                        </li>
                        <li> Extend <code>where?</code> to report <strong>0</strong> only if the sprite is dragged entirely off the game board. Run <code>display the tile</code> to test your improvements to <code>where?</code>. </li>
                        <li> Now improve <code>where?</code> further, so that it reports 1 for the top left tile, 2 for the top middle tile, 3 for the top right tile, and so on. 
                        </li>
                   </ol>
               </li>
               <div class="takeNote">Notice that even though <code>display the tile</code> is the block that <em>says</em> what tile you are in, you don't have to change it at all when you improve <code>where?</code>. In a similar way, you will be able to improve the way that <code>display the tile</code> displays the information without changing the details of <code>where?</code>. Building separate blocks to specialize in separate functions is extremely valuable for clear, bug-free, improvable code. </div>
          <li> Below is some code to draw a tic-tac-toe board. Your goal is to create blocks that make this code simpler.

		      <ul>
                <li>Don't bother building it first. You may decide not to use it at all.</li>
                <li>It's probably easiest to do this working with pen and paper, <em>not</em> while looking at this awful code! Perhaps notice how <em>you</em> draw a tic-tac-toe board.</li>
                <li>Use the same strategy you used above: building meaningful sub-tasks. Let each sub-block <em>specialize</em> in a task. </li>
                <li>Give your new sub-blocks names that say clearly what they do. Your goal is to make your code easy to read and understand. It could be wonderful if your resulting <code>draw tic-tac-toe board</code> reads naturally, like the language you would use to a person.</li>
