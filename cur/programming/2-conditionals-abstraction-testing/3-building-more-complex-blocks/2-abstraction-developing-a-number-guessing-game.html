		<h2>Abstraction: developing a number guessing game</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">

        	<li>JK: WHy are these all Take it Furthers? They seem like FYTD, just as options, not as separate problems.
                <ul>
        			<li>MF: That was probably my doing as it read like a TiF to me. If it really is, perhaps the whole page should be inside there so students don't read all the way down there onyl to see that they dont really have to do this stuff at all...</li>

        <p>The code sample below implements a simple number-guessing game.  The computer chooses a random number and then asks the player to guess it.  Click the image to load the code.</p>
        <div class="comment">MF: I wonder if there is any logic to when the image of the script is the link to the XML and when there is a text link. I have an aversion to "click here" type links (like "this file" here), so I'm in favor of making all XML links images.</div>

        <p>The game is not that cool yet. You will improve it to make it seem more like a person is playing with you.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
		    <p>Here are some ways to make the code act more like a human. Try each of these in order. When you are done, your finished code should be able to deal with <em>all</em> of them.</p>
        	<ol>
            	<li>Have the sprite welcome the player and ask the player's name before beginning.</li>
        		<li>When saying whether the player's guess is correct or not, have the sprite use the player's name. For example, &quot;Nope, Maria, that's not my number. Try again.&quot; or &quot;Wow, Maria, you got it!&quot; or </li>
        		<li>Have the sprite tell the player if the guessed number is too big or too small. &quot;That's too big, David. Try again.&quot;</li>
        		<li>Right now, the script always picks a number between 1 and 10.  At the start of the game, ask the player what the maximum number should be, and set a variable named <code>maximum</code> to that number. Let your program choose a number between 1 and <code>maximum</code>.  </li>
        		<li>Keep track of how many guesses it takes before the player guesses the right number.</li>
                <li>When the player guesses the secret number, say how many guesses it took, and congratulate them using their name.</li>
                <li>See if you can find a way to vary the language a bit so that your program does not always repeat exactly the same words in the same situation. For example, if a player guesses too high twice in a row, the program could say &quot;That's <em>still</em> too big, David. Try another number.&quot;
                <li>Be creative! Think of your own improvements.</li>
            </ol>
