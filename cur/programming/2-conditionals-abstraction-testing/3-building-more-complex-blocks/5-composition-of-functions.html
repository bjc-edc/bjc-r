		<h2>Composition of Functions</h2>
        <p>Consider the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/max-3-arg.png" alt="max of () and () and ()" title="max of () and () and ()" /> block definition below:</p>
        <img class="indent" alt="Script for 'max' with three arguments" src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/max-3-arg-code.png">
		<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<p>Using similar methodology, your challenge is to make the following blocks work by composing several functions together (and then maybe a little extra work):</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>A three-input addition operator that accepts only numbers.</p>
                    <img class="center" alt="Three-argument addition operator" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/3-arg-addition-block-BYOB.gif">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A reporter block named "sum of two smallest" that takes three numbers as inputs, and reports the sum of the two smallest (the example shown below would report 9):</p>
                    <img class="center" alt="sum of two smallest block" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/sum-of-two-smallest.png">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A predicate block named "Are any equal?" that compares 3 numbers and returns true if any two are equal to each other (the example shown below would return true):</p>
                    <img class="center" alt="Are any equal? predicate block" src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/composition-are-any-equal.png">
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
