		<h2>Input Types</h2>
        <p>The <code>max</code> block has an unexpected behavior. It is intended to work only for numbers, yet you can type text into it! <img class="indent" border="0" alt="Max can also take text" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/max-of-cat-dog-output.png"></p>
        <p>You have already used <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/is-5-a-number.png" alt="is input a number"> to <em>check</em> for situations like this, but you can also define blocks in a way that <em>allows</em> only the appropriate input.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        <p> 
        <div class="sidenote">The words &quot;input&quot; and &quot;argument&quot; are often used interchangeably. Nobody is being disagreeable!</div> 
        You can specify the input type that should be used in a block. For example, you can limit the <code>max</code> block to accept only numbers as arguments. 
        
      </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Open the Block Editor for the <code>max</code> block and click on one of the input names (e.g., <code>x</code>). You whould get this pop-up box</p>
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/edit-input-variable-x-BYOB.jpg" alt="Editing input 'x'">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Then, click on the right-arrow in the pop-up box. The dialog box (shown below) lets you choose the input type you want. For this block, you want a numbers-only slot (shown selected below). As you can see, the <em>shape</em> of the slot tells people  what type of input the block accepts. </p>
                    <p>You can also specify  a <em>default</em> value for the variable if you like. This is how the <code>move</code> block was defined always  to start as <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move-10-steps.png" width="110" height="24" alt="move 10 steps"> with the default value 10, and not just <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move-steps.png" width="100" height="24" alt="move steps"> with no default value specified.</p>
                    <img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/x-long-dialog.png" alt="Input Type" title="Input Type">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Modify both the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> variables to take only numbers and to have the default values of 5 and 10, respectively. Your Block Editor should then look like this, with the default values shown in the header:</p>
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Block-editor-max-block.png" alt="'max' block with defaults">
                    <p>When you click "OK," you should be able to see your block in the "Operators" tab, with the default values filled in. Also, note that you will no longer be able to enter text</p>
                    <img class="indent" border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/max-of-5-and-10.png" alt="'max' block with defaults">
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="takeNote">Even if we specify an input type for a block it could still receive improper values when a variable is passed in as its argument (<span class="snap">snap</span> won’t constantly check if the variable’s type is the same as the block’s input type). As such, input types should only be used as an organizational tool to keep you thinking about what the domain (input values) of your blocks should be.</div>
