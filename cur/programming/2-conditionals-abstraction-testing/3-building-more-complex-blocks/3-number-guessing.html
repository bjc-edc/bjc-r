        	<li>JK: WHy are these all Take it Furthers? They seem like FYTD, just as options, not as separate problems.
                <ul>
        			<li>MF: That was probably my doing as it read like a TiF to me. If it really is, perhaps the whole page should be inside there so students don't read all the way down there onyl to see that they dont really have to do this stuff at all...</li>

        <p>The code sample below implements a simple number-guessing game.  The computer chooses a random number and then asks the player to guess it.  Click the image to load the code.</p>
        <div class="comment">MF: I wonder if there is any logic to when the image of the script is the link to the XML and when there is a text link. I have an aversion to "click here" type links (like "this file" here), so I'm in favor of making all XML links images.</div>

        <p>The game is not that cool yet. You will improve it to make it seem more like a person is playing with you.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
		    <p>Here are six ways to make the code act more like a human. If you think of anything else that would make it even better, feel free to add it in. Try each of these in order. When you are done, your finished code should be able to deal with <em>all</em> of the challenges.</p>
        	<ol>
            	<li>The sprite should welcome the player and ask the player's name before beginning.</li>
        		<li>If the player guesses incorrectly, the sprite should tell say so, using their name. For example, if Colleen is playing the game, the sprite should say something like <code>Nope, Colleen, that's not my number. Try again.</code></li>
        		<li>The sprite should also tell the player if the secret number is bigger or smaller than the number that the player guessed.</li>
        		<li>Right now, the script always picks a number between 1 and 10. Change this so that it picks a number between 1 and a variable named <code>maximum</code>. At the start of the game, ask the plaer what that maximum number should be. </li>
        		<li>Keep track of how many guesses it takes before the player guesses the right number.</li>
                <li>When the player guesses the secret number, say how many guesses it took, and congratulate them using their name.</li>
            </ol>
