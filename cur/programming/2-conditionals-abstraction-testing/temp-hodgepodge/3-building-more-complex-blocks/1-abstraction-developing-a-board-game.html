		<h2>Abstraction: Developing a Board Game</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <ul>
                <li>REVISION NOTES: Most of this has now been done IN U1. </li>
                	<ul>
                		<li>Trim back to the parts that have not been done. </li>
                		<li>We have not <em>combined</em> the column, row information to create <strong>which cell?</strong> </li>
                		<li>Include <strong>average </strong>and<strong> move to cell</strong>. </li>
                		<li>Elevate TiF content to FYtD because it is on the main road to TicTacToe. </li>
                		<li>Give the two sprite tiles from U3L4p2 before teaching <strong>stamp</strong>.</li>
                		<li>Include <strong>when I am dropped</strong>, so that the TTT game is now “complete” except that it depends on <em>players</em>, not <strong>list</strong>, to keep honest track of the game. </li>

                <li>GitHub Feedback:
                	<ul>
                        <li>It's not clear what the inputs to each block should represent. Particularly, the size parameter really ought to be named. The big advantage of Snap! is that we can have a mix of inputs and the function name.</li>
                        <li><strong>GH feedback:</strong> Using three blocks, <br />Should read more clearly as<br />Using three blocks that you develop...<br />Went looking for a while?</li>
                        <li>GH Feedback 10/23/15: Provide more help. This is very vague.</li>
                        <li>GH Feedback 11/2/15: Take It Further part A references tile 9 as important without the context of a tic-tac-toe game to make it important.</li>
                        <li>GH Feedback 11/29/15: SCAFFOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!! This makes no sense. Too much assuming that the kids would know how to make the custom blocks on here.</li>
                        <li>GH Feedback 12/9/15: honestly, all the custom blocks should be blue; that's what i did in my CS class when i was making this project; the blocks are more convenient to find this way</li>
                        <li>GH Feedback 1/14/16: show the built blocks</li>

 <p>In Unit 1 you made a start toward a tic-tac-toe game by writing the code to draw the game board. Now you'll take another step by sensing which cell a player wants to move into.<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">  
            <ol>
            <li>Load your project <strong>U1L4-TicTacToe</strong>.
              <li>Build a predicate               <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/between.png" alt="Is () between () and () ?"> that           
              tests whether its first input is bigger than the second input and less than the third. You'll use this to test where the sprite is, first just whether it's inside the board at all, then which cell it's in.
              <br />
              <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/between-true.png" alt="is 27 between 12 and 40? -&gt; true"><br />
              <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/between-false.png" alt="is 27 between 12 and 20? -&gt; false">
              </li>
              <li>  Build a predicate <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/on-the-board-p.png" alt="on the board?"> that uses your <code>between?</code> block to report <code>true</code> if the sprite is on the board, and reports <code>false</code> if the sprite is dragged completely off the board.</li>
                        <li> 
                            Build a reporter <code>which cell?</code> that tells which cell the sprite has been dragged into. 
                            Here is one way to do it that uses two other blocks you'll write that report <code>which column?</code> and <code>which row?</code> the sprite is in.
                            <div class="commentBig">Redraw as discussed in meeting.</div>
                            <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/which-cell(n)-without-computation.png" alt="partial script for "which-cell?" reporter"></p>
                            <p>Don't forget that your board game project isn't <em>only</em> for tic-tac-toe. You can draw nine-by-nine Sudoku boards, seven-by-seven Connect Four boards, and so on. Therefore, these blocks wil need to know how many rows and columns there are, so they'll need the input <code>n</code>.</p>
                            <div class="endnote">There are many ways to write <code>which row?</code> and <code>which column?</code> You can, of course, use lots of <code>if</code> statements, but since the number of rows can change, it's hard to know how many to use. One convenient way is to divide the total size of the game board by the size of each cell. To use that result, you need to round down. <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/round-a-number.png" alt="round a number"> can do it, but it rounds to the <em>nearest</em> integer, up <em>or</em> down. The function <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/floor of number.png" alt="floor of number"> always rounds <em>down</em>, making it easier to use. The <code>floor</code> function is in the same block as <code>sqrt</code>.</div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Here's a block that you can use to test how well your other blocks work together.<br />
                            <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/play-on-n-by-n-board.png" alt="play on n-by-n board">  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/play-on-n-by-n-board.gif" alt="animation of play"><br />
                            Try it out for boards of different sizes.
                        </li>
                   </ol>
               </li>
			</ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Create a block <code>move to tile (n)</code> that takes a tile number as input and moves your sprite to the center of that tile. Because the location of tile 9 depends on how many tiles there are, your <code>move to tile </code> block will need to know the size of the board.</li>
                <li>Create <code>mark tile (n)</code> to move to the specified tile and <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/stamp.png" alt="stamp, from the Pen palette"> the sprite's shape on that tile to mark it as "taken."</li>
                <li>Create a second sprite with a different shape so that people can take turns, with their own sprite, stamping its mark on a tile.</li>
                <div class="endnote">In Unit 3, you will learn ways to keep track of which tiles have been taken  by which player. Then you can improve your game more. It could become like tic-tac-toe, or connect-four, or....</div>
