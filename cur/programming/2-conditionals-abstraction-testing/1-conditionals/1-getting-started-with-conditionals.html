        <ul>
        	<li>
            	We could introduce a few logic puzzles with if-then (maybe it could be in the TG as a lesson opener). Or a choose your own adventure style activity. 
            </li>
            <li>MF: Maybe students could write their own choose their own activity at the end of the lesson.</li>
            <li>MF: Maybe we could keep the truth tables but put them in the lesson openers in the TG.</li>

        <p>This code <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/follow-that-mouse.png" alt="Follow That Mouse Script"/>  appeared in  &lt;link to Lab XX&gt; and this code appeared in &lt;link to Lab XX&gt;<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/repeat-until-direction-equals-90-move-1-turn-cw-1.png" alt="repeat-until-direction-equals-90-move-1-turn-clockwise-1">.</p>
        <p>The following scripts use one new  block, <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if-else.png" alt="if-else">, which you can find in the yellow Control tab, and <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/x-position.png" alt="x position">, which you can find in the blue Motion tab.</p>
          <ol>
            <li> Construct each of these scripts and figure out how it works. You will use what you learn about these scripts to solve the puzzles in problem 2.<br />

            <li>Four puzzles: For each picture, create a script (or modify one you already have) that keeps the sprite moving in a circle drawing that picture.</li>

            <li>Create a script that lets you write on the stage in two colors, using your mouse:

   <div class="takeNote"> 
     <p><strong>Conditional statements:</strong> Code like <code>if</code> and <code>if-else</code> and <code>repeat-until</code> allows your programs to perform different actions or computations depending on a <em>condition</em> that you specify. In computer science, we refer to such code as <strong>conditional statements</strong>. </p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p><strong>Predicates: </strong> In this lab, you tested conditions  such as <code>x position &lt; 0</code> and <code>direction = 30 OR direction = 60</code>. If those tests showed the condition to be <code>true</code>, the code behaved one way; if <code>false</code>, the code behaved a different way. Tests  that report only  <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> are called <strong>predicates.</strong></p>
