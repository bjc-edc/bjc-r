                <li>
                    We could introduce a few logic puzzles with if-then (maybe it could be in the TG as a lesson opener). Or a choose your own adventure style activity. 
                </li>
                <li>MF: Maybe students could write their own choose their own activity at the end of the lesson.</li>
                <li>MF: Maybe we could keep the truth tables but put them in the lesson openers in the TG.</li>
                <li>(this is Dan Garcia) Take it further 4 has the interesting feature that you can change the repeat blocks to have values that don't add to 360, but say add to 90, you get a beautiful tiger pattern. Like this http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=dan%20garcia&ProjectName=Tiger and if they don't add to a number that 360 is a multiple of, the tiger pattern "moves". So there's potential for a nice conversation (which we went into in NYC) how to get the tiger pattern with the if/else that the repeat was able to give. Great followups questions 4a and 4b.</li>

            <p><strong>Conditional statements:</strong> Code like <code>if</code> and <code>if-else</code> and <code>repeat-until</code> allows your programs to perform different actions or computations depending on a <em>condition</em> that you specify. In computer science, we refer to such code as <strong>conditional statements</strong>. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Predicates: </strong> In this lab, you tested conditions  such as <code>x position &lt; 0</code> and <code>direction = 30 OR direction = 60</code>. If those tests showed the condition to be <code>true</code>, the code behaved one way; if <code>false</code>, the code behaved a different way. Tests  that report only  <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> are called <strong>predicates.</strong></p>
