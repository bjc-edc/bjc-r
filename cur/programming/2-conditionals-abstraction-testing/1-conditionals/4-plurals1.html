SHOW EXACT CODE TO HAVE THEM <strong>map</strong> their <strong>plural</strong> over the entire list to test it. NO FANCY COMMENTS ABOUT LISTS OR <strong>MAP</strong>. </li>

        <p>The goal now is to build <code>plural</code>, a reporter block that takes a noun as input and outputs the plural of the noun, spelled correctly.  
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural-day-with-result.png"  alt="plural day (with result)">
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural-boss-with-result.png"  alt="plural boss (with result)"> </p> <div class="sidenote">
            Choose the <em>reporter</em> button when you make the <code>plural</code> block. 
            <p> <img src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/make-a-reporter.png" alt="select reporter as block type"/> </p>
        </div>
        <p> Here's one way to start building that block.</p>
        <p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural-(script).png"  alt="plural-(script), first try"> </p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
        	<ol start="2">
        		<li>Build this much and test it out on at least "day" and "boss" and "medicine," to make sure it works correctly for those. If it does not, edit it to fix it. </li>
        		<li> <strong>Debugging: </strong> Try hard to find words for which this version of <code>plural</code> does <em>not</em>  work correctly. Write down the words you find. <em>Organize that list</em>, sorting the words into categories according to their last letter. For example, some of the words it gets wrong will be words that end with the letter <em>h</em>. Try to find other words it gets wrong. You will probably find other categories. <strong><em>Save your list</em></strong>. You will need it for future activities.</li>

                	<div class="comment">Rebuild this image without the white background. --MF</div>
					<p><strong>Debugging: </strong>One important part of writing code that works is trying to "break"  it, trying to find situations in which it does <em>not</em> work. This requires  thinking of diverse examples, wild and exceptional cases, sometimes even including inputs that are incorrect in some way. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural-bulldog[space]-with-result(bulldog[space]s).png" alt="plural of a word with a space following the word"></p>
					<p>For now, focus only on real English nouns, typed correctly. Record the ones that <code>plural</code> spells wrong.</p>
				</div>
                <li> 
                	<code>plural</code> should now work correctly for "day" and "boss" and "medicine," but it probably doesn't yet work correctly for the word "box"
                	<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural-box-with-(wrong)-result.png"  alt="suffix s box (with wrong result)">. 
                    <p> Edit your <code>plural</code> block to make it work for words that end with x. </p>
