            <ul>
                <li>JK: I suggest putting all the suffix stuff on a new page called "Plural Suffix" or something so that it's clear it's a bigger deal than just a single problem.</li>
                <li>JK: Make it clearer that the snap project they load has the library loaded onto it.</li>
                <li>Can we call it "plural" rather than "suffix?"</li>
                <li>The order of these pages is problematic.</li>

            	<li>Make a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/state-of-water.png" alt="state of water ()"/> block that takes in a temperature and says whether water will be liquid, solid, or gas at that temperature.</li>
                <li>Make a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/traffic-signal.png" alt="traffic signal ()"/> block that when given the words "red," "yellow," or "green," makes the sprite say the appropriate action. For example <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/traffic-signal-green.png" alt="traffic signal ('green')"/> should make the sprite say "go."</li>
                <li> 
                    Edit your traffic signal block to change the sprite's costume to show the correct color light. You can find a set of stoplight costumes <a class="run" href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=Paul&ProjectName=Stoplights">here</a>.
