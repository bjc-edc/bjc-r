        <div class = "sidenote"> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Direction-mod-60_203x28.png" alt="127 mod 60"> reports 0 any time that the sprite's <code>direction</code> is a multiple of 60&deg;. So, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/direction-mod-60-equals-0.png" alt="direction-mod-60-equals-0"> will be true only when the <code>direction</code> is 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300. 
              <p><em><strong>n</strong></em> <code>mod</code> <em><strong>m</strong></em> reports the remainder when <em>n</em> is divided by <em>m</em>. 
                 So, when the sprite's direction is not a multiple of 60, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Direction-mod-60_203x28.png" alt="127 mod 60"> reports a number other than 0 (and less than 60). For example, if the sprite is pointing in the direction 127&deg;, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Direction-mod-60_203x28.png" alt="127 mod 60"> reports 7.

              <p>When the sprite is pointing in direction 90, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/direction-mod-30.png" alt="direction mod 30"> reports 0.
              </p> 
                 <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/90-divided-by-30.png" alt="90 divided by 30 with zero remainder">.
              <p>
                 In how many other directions will <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/direction-mod-30-equals-0.png" width="278" height="34" alt="direction-mod-30-equals-0"> report <code>true</code>?

          <ol>
            <li>Construct each of these scripts and figure out how it works. You will use what you learn about these scripts to solve the puzzles in problem 2. <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />

            </li>
            <li>Two puzzles: For each picture, create a script (or modify one you already have) that keeps the sprite moving in a circle drawing that picture.
            </li>

                 </p>
            <li>And try to create a script that has this behavior.
            </li>
