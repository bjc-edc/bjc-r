		<h2>Getting Started</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
        <ul>
        	<li>In #3, show the predicate blocks. And give some non-examples.</li>
            <li>Let's us the term "procedures" for subroutines where appropriate.</li>
            <li>
            	We could:
                  <ul>
                    <li>We could introduce a few logic puzzles with if-then (maybe it could be in the TG as a lesson opener). Or a choose your own adventure style activity. </li>
                    
                    <li>Experiement with prediates and do a few problems and then do Bowen's idea before.</li>
                  </ul>
            </li>
            <li>MF: Maybe students could write their own choose their own activity at the end of the lesson.</li>
            <li>MF: Maybe we could keep the truth tables but put them in the lesson openers in the TG.</li>
            <li>PG: One possitbility: start with the traffic light then go to the plurals.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This code <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/follow-that-mouse.png" alt="Follow That Mouse Script"/>  appeared in  &lt;link to Lab XX&gt; and this code appeared in &lt;link to Lab XX&gt;<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/repeat-until-direction-equals-90-move-1-turn-cw-1.png" alt="repeat-until-direction-equals-90-move-1-turn-clockwise-1">.</p>
        <p>The following scripts use one new  block, <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if-else.png" alt="if-else">, which you can find in the yellow Control tab, and <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/x-position.png" alt="x position"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/direction.png" alt="direction">, which you can find in the blue Motion tab.</p>
          <ol>
            <li> To solve the puzzles in problem 2, you will need to build these scripts figure out how they work. Construct each script and puzzle out how it works.<br />

            <li>Six puzzles: Create scripts (or modify ones you already have) to draw these pictures.</li>

            <li>And try to create a script that has this behavior.</li>
