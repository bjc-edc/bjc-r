		<h2>Plurals, continued<code></code></h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
        <ul>
        	<li>JK: Again, I would combine all the suffix problems together, or at least call this page "suffix continued" or something. Also, why is this program called "suffix" rather than "pluralizer" or something?</li>
            <li>JK: Is "specialist" block a real term? For some reason, I'm imagining that I've heard the term "helper block" before too.</li>
            <!-- <li>JK: Overall, I found this page confusing.#4-6 seem like a completely different direction, and then on top of that, lists are introduced. By the way, OR is also introduced here, which seems strange. I might ONLY include version 2 of the vowel thing here, then later refer back to this problem when talking about OR. Maybe the list stuff can be in take it further. In fact, perhaps the "is a vowel?" can go on the previous page (after the traffic lights), and then this project can get students to use their vowel block here.</li>
            <li>JK: At the very least, I would get rid of <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/list-of-vowels-contains-randomly-picked-letter-of-pencil_666x39.png" alt="list of vowels contains randomly picked letter of pencil"><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/item-pick-random-1-to-7-of-list-I-you-he-she-etc_605x33.png" alt="item pick random element from list of I you he she it we they">. They'll see lists in Unit 3.</li> -->

           <p>In this lab, you will continue to improve your <code>plural</code> block so that it works correctly with more words. If you do not already have it, please reload it. (The suggested file name was <code>U2Lab1-Plural</code>.)  You will also need your list of words that <code>plural</code> did not pluralize correctly.</p>
           <div class="takeNote">
              <p><strong>Abstraction: </strong> Creating an English plural has a lot of special cases. To some words, you add  <em>s</em>; to some words you add  <em>es</em>;  words like <em>calf</em> and <em>fly</em> become <em>calves</em> and <em>flies</em>, changing their final letters before adding <em>es</em>. And there are special cases to handle. The best way to program complicated jobs  is (generally) to break them into parts, handle each part separately with its own procedure (its own block), and then have the &quot;top-level&quot; block—in this case, <code>plural</code>, itself—show only the outline. That is, instead of coding every little detail—checking for each special case and handling it—directly in <code>plural</code>, it is cleaner and clearer to build a block that looks something like this, with each special case handled by block that specializes in that case only.</p>
             <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural-abstract-definition.png" alt="abstract definition of plural: if h = last letter of word, report h-case plural; if y = last letter of word, report y-case plural; if some other case, use a block that specializes in that case; etc.; else report join word s"></p>
              <p>Showing the structure of the method—just the overall strategy—in the &quot;top-level&quot; block and relegating the details to  separate blocks is one part of an important computer science idea called <strong>abstraction</strong>. This aspect of abstraction is  extremely helpful in keeping your code clear and helping you debug it. </p>

              <li> Make a block that &quot;specializes&quot; on just one category, words that end with the letter h.
                     <p> You might name that block <code>plural (lastLetter=h)</code> as shown here, or <code>h-plural</code> if you prefer.</p>
                     <p> This specialist block should work correctly for words that fit its specialty <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_h-crutch-with-result.png" alt="plural (for words ending with h) with correct  result for the word crutch"> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_h-moth-with-result.png" alt="suffix s (for words ending in h) with result for moth">, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_h-bush-with-result.png" alt="plural (for words ending in h) with result"> but it can be completely wrong about words that <em>don't</em> fit its specialty <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_h-case-with-(wrong)result.png" alt="plural (for words ending with h) with wrong result for case (wrong input) ">. 
                     <p> <code>plural (lastLetter=h)</code> doesn't have to work for &quot;case&quot; because &quot;case&quot; does not end in h, and so the <code>plural</code> block will never give &quot;case&quot; to <code>plural (lastLetter=h)</code>. </p>
                     <p>Test it with a variety of words to make sure it works the way you want.</p>
               </li>
               <li> When you trust your new specialist block, edit your original <code> plural</code> block to use your new specialist. Test your revised <code>plural</code> block to make sure it still works for all the words it used to work for, as well as the new ones.</li>
               <li> Take the next step. Create <code>plural (lastLetter=y)</code> to handle words like this. 
                   <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_y-tray-with-result.png"  alt="plural_y-tray-with-result">
                   <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_y-sky-with-result.png" alt="plural_y-sky-with-result"></li>
                   <p>As before, this specialist can make mistakes if asked to do a job that isn't its  specialty <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_y-mouse-with-(wrong)result.png" alt="plural_y-mouse-with-(wrong)result">. <code>plural</code> will take care to give it only the cases it knows how to handle correctly.</p>
          </ol>
</div>
          
<div class="takeItFurther">
            <div> <ol start="4"> <li> Extending <code>plural</code> handle more special cases will become easier when you know more about handling <strong>lists</strong> (Unit 3), but even now you know enough to extend it to some more cases. Use the idea of special-purpose blocks to help organize the cases and keep <code>plural</code> from becoming cluttered with details.</li>
              <li>Can you find a way to handle <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural-bulldog(with-spaces)-(with-result).png" alt="plural of a word with spaces following the word">? You do already have a block that  specializes in making the plural of words that don't have a space at the end, and you can use it.</li>
