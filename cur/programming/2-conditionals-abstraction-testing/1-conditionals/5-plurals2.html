        <div class="todo">
        <ul>
        	<li>JK: Again, I would combine all the suffix problems together, or at least call this page "suffix continued" or something. Also, why is this program called "suffix" rather than "pluralizer" or something?</li>
            <li>JK: Is "specialist" block a real term? For some reason, I'm imagining that I've heard the term "helper block" before too.</li>
            <!-- <li>JK: Overall, I found this page confusing.#4-6 seem like a completely different direction, and then on top of that, lists are introduced. By the way, OR is also introduced here, which seems strange. I might ONLY include version 2 of the vowel thing here, then later refer back to this problem when talking about OR. Maybe the list stuff can be in take it further. In fact, perhaps the "is a vowel?" can go on the previous page (after the traffic lights), and then this project can get students to use their vowel block here.</li>
            <li>JK: At the very least, I would get rid of <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/list-of-vowels-contains-randomly-picked-letter-of-pencil_666x39.png" alt="list of vowels contains randomly picked letter of pencil"><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/item-pick-random-1-to-7-of-list-I-you-he-she-etc_605x33.png" alt="item pick random element from list of I you he she it we they">. They'll see lists in Unit 3.</li> -->

        </div>
           <p>In this lab, you will continue to improve your <code>suffix s</code> block so that it works correctly with more words. If you do not already have it, please reload it. (The suggested file name was <code>U2Lab1-Plural</code>.)  You will also need your list of words that <code>plural</code> did not pluralize correctly.</p>

                       <div class="sidenote">The idea of building a separate block to handle one special case and then incorporating that block in the bigger procedure isn't necessary for very simple cases (like &quot;ends with x&quot;) that you test for only once. In more complex cases, like &quot;ends with h,&quot; building your code in modules is extremely helpful in keeping your code clear and helping you debug it.
                       </div> 
                   Make a block that &quot;specializes&quot; on just one category, words that end with the letter h.
                     <p> You might name that block <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_h-bush-with-result.png" alt="plural (for words ending in h) with result">. </p>
                     <p> This specialist block can be completely wrong about words that <em>don't</em> fit its specialty  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_h-case-with-(wrong)result.png" alt="plural (for words ending with h) with wrong result for case (wrong input) "> (&quot;case&quot; does not end in h), but it should work correctly for words that do fit its specialty <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_h-crash-with-result.png" alt="plural (for words ending with h) with correct  result for the word crash"><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_h-moth-with-result.png" alt="suffix s (for words ending in h) with result for moth">. Test it for a variety of words to make sure it works the way you want.
               </li>
               <li>When you trust your new specialist block, edit the original <code> plural</code> block to use your new specialist. Test the revised <code>plural</code> block to make sure it still works for all the words it used to work for, and also the new ones.  
               </li>
                
          </ol>

<div class="takeItFurther">
            <div> <ol start="3"> <li> Extend <code>plural</code> so that it works properly for words that end with y and make sure that it still works for the other words that it used to work for.</li>
