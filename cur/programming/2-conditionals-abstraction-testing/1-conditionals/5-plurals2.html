                <li>JK: Again, I would combine all the suffix problems together, or at least call this page "suffix continued" or something. Also, why is this program called "suffix" rather than "pluralizer" or something?</li>
                <li>JK: Is "specialist" block a real term? For some reason, I'm imagining that I've heard the term "helper block" before too.</li>
                <!--Have these comments been dealt with? If so, let's just remove them... --MF-->
                <!-- <li>JK: Overall, I found this page confusing.#4-6 seem like a completely different direction, and then on top of that, lists are introduced. By the way, OR is also introduced here, which seems strange. I might ONLY include version 2 of the vowel thing here, then later refer back to this problem when talking about OR. Maybe the list stuff can be in take it further. In fact, perhaps the "is a vowel?" can go on the previous page (after the traffic lights), and then this project can get students to use their vowel block here.</li>
                <li>JK: At the very least, I would get rid of <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/list-of-vowels-contains-randomly-picked-letter-of-pencil_666x39.png" alt="list of vowels contains randomly picked letter of pencil"><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/item-pick-random-1-to-7-of-list-I-you-he-she-etc_605x33.png" alt="item pick random element from list of I you he she it we they">. They'll see lists in Unit 3.</li> -->
                <li>GitHub Feedback: The file names need to be consistent. We did plural in Unit 3.</li>

        <p>In this lab, you will continue to improve your <code>plural</code> block so that it works correctly with more words. If you do not already have it, please reload it. (The suggested file name was <code>U2Lab1-Plural</code>.)  You will also need your list of words that <code>plural</code> did not pluralize correctly.</p>

                    <strong>Abstraction: </strong> Make a <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_h.png" alt="plural"> block that "specializes" on just one category, words that end with the letter <strong>h</strong>.
                    <p> This specialist block should work correctly for words that fit its specialty <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_h-crutch-with-result.png" alt="plural (for words ending with h) with correct  result for the word crutch"> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_h-moth-with-result.png" alt="suffix s (for words ending in h) with result for moth">, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_h-bush-with-result.png" alt="plural (for words ending in h) with result">. It can be completely wrong about words that <em>don't</em> fit its specialty <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_h-mouse-with-(wrong)result.png" alt="plural (for words ending with h) with wrong result for mouse (wrong input) "> because the <code>plural</code> block should never give words to <code>h-plural</code> unless those words end with <strong>h</strong>. </p>
                    <p>Test <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_h.png" alt="plural"> with a variety of words to make sure it works the way you want.</p>

                <div class="takeNote">
                	<p><strong>Abstraction: </strong> English is complicated and has a lot of special cases. To pluralize some nouns, you add  <em>s</em>; to some  you add  <em>es</em>;  nouns like <em>calf</em> and <em>fly</em> become <em>calves</em> and <em>flies</em>, changing their final letters before adding <em>es</em>. And there are other special cases to handle. For a programming task this complex, it  is (generally) best to break it into parts, handle each part separately with its own procedure (its own block), and then have the "top-level" block—in this case, <code>plural</code>, itself—show only the outline. That is, instead of coding every little detail directly in <code>plural</code>, it is cleaner and clearer to build a block that looks something like this, with each special case handled by block that specializes in that case only.</p>
                    <div class="comment">I think we should use a some with "..." written with text. This looks like "&middot;" is a block that we just don't know.</div>
                    <div class="comment">Rebuild this image and the imges below without white backgrounds. --MF</div>
                    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural-abstract-definition.png" alt="abstract definition of plural: if h = last letter of word, report h-case plural; if y = last letter of word, report y-case plural; if some other case, use a block that specializes in that case; etc.; else report join word s"></p>
                    <p>Showing<a name="abstraction" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>the <em>structure</em> of the method—just the overall strategy—in the "top-level" block and relegating the details to  separate blocks is one part of an important computer science idea called <strong>abstraction</strong>. This aspect of abstraction is extremely helpful in keeping your code clear and helping you debug it. </p>
				</div>
				<li> When you trust your new specialist block, edit your original <code> plural</code> block to use your new specialist. Test your revised <code>plural</code> block to make sure it still works for all the words it used to work for, as well as the new ones.</li>
				<li> Take the next step. Create <code>plural-y</code> to handle words like this.

				<p>As before, this specialist can make mistakes if it is asked to do a job that isn't its  specialty <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural_y-mouse-with-(wrong)result.png" alt="plural_y-mouse-with-(wrong)result">. </p>
				<p><code>plural</code> will take care to give it only the cases it knows how to handle correctly.</p>

        <div class="takeItFurther"><a name="further" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
            <ol type="A"> 
                <li> Extend <code>plural</code> to handle another special case, using a special-purpose block to  keep <code>plural</code> from becoming cluttered with details. (Choose whatever special case you like. Some extensions will become easier when you learn more about  <strong>lists</strong> in Unit 3, but even now you can handle some new cases.)</li>
                <li><strong>An important idea lurks here: </strong>Right now, if <code>plural</code> is given a word with a space at the end, it leaves that space in the plural, like this: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural-bulldog[space]-with-result(bulldog[space]s).png" alt="plural of bulldog with space at the end, and result with space before s">. Figure out how to handle this special case and edit <code>plural</code> so that the result is <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural-bulldog[space]-with-result(bulldogs).png" alt="plural of bulldog with space at the end, and correct result, no space before s">? You  already have a block that  <em>specializes</em> in making plurals of words that <em>don't</em> have a space at the end. You can use it.</li>
                <li>Once <code>plural</code> works for a single space at the end of a word, try giving it <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural-bulldog[four-spaces].png" alt="plural of bulldog with four spaces at the end">. <strong>Challenge: </strong>Explain why that works!</li>
