		<h2>Plurals, continued<code></code></h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
        <ul>
        	<li>JK: Again, I would combine all the suffix problems together, or at least call this page "suffix continued" or something. Also, why is this program called "suffix" rather than "pluralizer" or something?</li>
            <li>JK: Is "specialist" block a real term? For some reason, I'm imagining that I've heard the term "helper block" before too.</li>
            <!-- <li>JK: Overall, I found this page confusing.#4-6 seem like a completely different direction, and then on top of that, lists are introduced. By the way, OR is also introduced here, which seems strange. I might ONLY include version 2 of the vowel thing here, then later refer back to this problem when talking about OR. Maybe the list stuff can be in take it further. In fact, perhaps the "is a vowel?" can go on the previous page (after the traffic lights), and then this project can get students to use their vowel block here.</li>
            <li>JK: At the very least, I would get rid of <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/list-of-vowels-contains-randomly-picked-letter-of-pencil_666x39.png" alt="list of vowels contains randomly picked letter of pencil"><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/item-pick-random-1-to-7-of-list-I-you-he-she-etc_605x33.png" alt="item pick random element from list of I you he she it we they">. They'll see lists in Unit 3.</li> -->

        </div>
           <p>In this lab, you will continue to improve your <code>suffix s</code> block so that it works correctly with more words. If you do not already have it, please reload it. (The suggested file name was <code>U2Lab1-Plural</code>.)</p>
    
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
           
          <ol>
                
              <li>Organize your list of words that <code>plural</code> gets wrong. Organize those words into categories according to their last letter. For example, some of the words it gets wrong will be words that end with the letter h. Try to find others it gets wrong. You will probably find at least two more categories.</li>

            
          <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" />
<li> <div class="sidenote">The idea of building a separate block to handle one special case and then incorporating that block in the bigger procedure isn't necessary for very simple cases (like &quot;ends with x&quot;) that you test for only once. In more complex cases, like &quot;ends with h,&quot; building your code in modules is extremely helpful in keeping your code clear and helping you debug it.</div> 
                Make a  &quot;specialist&quot; block that is designed to work for just one category, the words that end with the letter h.<br /> 
      You might name that block   <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Suffix S for words ending in h (with result) 425 × 40 pixels.png" alt="suffix s (for words ending in h) with result">. This specialist block can be completely wrong about words that <em>don't</em> fit its specialty <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/suffix s (for words ending with h) with wrong result for case (wrong input) 423 × 40 pixels).png" alt="suffix s (for words ending with h) with wrong result for case (wrong input) "> (&quot;case&quot; does not end in h), but it should work correctly for words that do fit its specialty <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/suffix s (for words ending with h) with correct result for crash 433 × 40 pixels).png" alt="suffix s (for words ending with h) with correct  result for the word crash"><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/suffix s (for words ending in h) with result for moth 417 × 40 pixels).png" alt="suffix s (for words ending in h) with result for moth">. Test it for a variety of words to make sure it works the way you want.</li>
                <li>When you trust your new specialist block, edit the original <code> suffix s</code> block to use your new specialist. Test the revised <code>suffix s</code> block to make sure it still works for all the words it used to work for, and also the new ones.  </li>
                
          </ol>
</div>
          
<div class="takeItFurther">
            <div> <ol start="4"> <li> Extend <code>suffix s</code> so that it works properly for words that end with y and make sure that it still works for the other words that it used to work for.</li>
