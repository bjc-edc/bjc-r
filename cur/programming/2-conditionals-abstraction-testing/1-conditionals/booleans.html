		<h2>Getting Started</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
        <ul>
        	<li>In #3, show the predicate blocks. And give some non-examples.</li>
            <li>Let's us the term "procedures" for subroutines where appropriate.</li>
            <li>
            	We could:
                  <ul>
                    <li>We could introduce a few logic puzzles with if-then (maybe it could be in the TG as a lesson opener). Or a choose your own adventure style activity. </li>
                    
                    <li>Experiement with prediates and do a few problems and then do Bowen's idea before.</li>
                  </ul>
            </li>
            <li>MF: Maybe students could write their own choose their own activity at the end of the lesson.</li>
            <li>MF: Maybe we could keep the truth tables but put them in the lesson openers in the TG.</li>
            <li>PG: One possitbility: start with the traffic light then go to the plurals.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This code <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/follow-that-mouse.png" alt="Follow That Mouse Script"/>  appeared in  &lt;link to Lab XX&gt;. </p>
        <p>The following scripts use one new  block, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/IfElse_72x101.png" alt="If Else">, which you can find in the yellow Control tab, and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/X-Position_104x22.png" alt="x position"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/direction_94x22.png" alt="direction">, which you can find in the blue Motion tab.</p>
          <ol>
            <li> To solve the puzzles in problem 2, you will need to build these scripts figure out how they work. Construct each script and puzzle out how it works.<br />
              <div class = "sidenote"> When the sprite is pointing in the direction 127°, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Direction-mod-60_203x28.png" alt="127 mod 60"> reports 7, because when you divide 127 by 60 the remainder is 7. <br /> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/227DividedBy60.png" alt="127 divided by 60 leaving a remainder of 7"> <br />

            <li>Six puzzles: Create scripts (or modify ones you already have) to draw these pictures.</li>

            <li>And try to create a script that has this behavior.</li>

        <div class="takeNote">
<div>  Reporter blocks can report many kinds of values. The <code>plus</code> block, for example, reports a number. <br /> 
              <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/reporter-plus-reporting-10.gif" alt="plus block reporting the number 10"><br />
            Some reporter blocks, like <code>greater than</code> report only two special values: <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true"/>  when a condition is met and and <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false"/>  when it is not met. Reporters that report only <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are called "predicates."
       	      <p> <img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/predicate-returning-boolean.gif" alt="5 > 3 returns 'true'"/></p> 
    <p> In <span class="snap">snap</span>, these functions have the hexagonal shape: <img src="/bjc-r/img/cond/demo-predicate-block.png" alt="a predicate block"/>. </p> 
    <p> <code>equals</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>and</code>, and <code>or</code> are other predicates you will often find useful:  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/equals-reporting-true_293x44.png" alt="equals reporting true">
    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/not-true-reports-false244x44.png" alt="not true, reporting false">
    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/not-seven-plus-three-equals-12-reports-true_361x44.png" alt="not 7 plus 3 equals 12, reporting true">
    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/7-plus-3-equals-12-OR-7-plus-3-less-than-12-reports-true_548x44.png" alt="a false statement or a true statement, reporting true"></p>
    Predicate functions are like questions that can be answered with <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. These two special values  are  called Boolean values, named after the  logician George Boole. </div></div>
