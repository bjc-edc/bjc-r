		<h2>Booleans</h2>
        <p>You already know what <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/follow-that-mouse.png" alt="Follow That Mouse Script"/>  does. </p>
    	<p>The following script uses two new blocks,  <code>if</code>  and  <code>distance to</code>: <br /> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/forever-snap-to-mouse-pointer.png" style="height:100px;" class="indent" alt="forever, if distance to mouse is less than 20, go to mouse pointer"></p>
    	<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        <ol>
            <li>First  analyze this new script and predict what it <em>should</em> do.</li>
            <li> In actuality, it doesn't behave exactly as it &quot;should.&quot; Nothing in the script should make its behavior depend on  mouse speed, but speed does matter. Build it and experiment with it. Then come up with a theory to explain the behavior you see.</li>
          </ol></div>
    	<p>The <code>if</code> block sets a <strong>condition</strong>. The script checks continuously to see if that condition <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/distance-to-mouse-less-than-20.png" class="block" alt="distance to mouse less than 20"> is true. Only if the condition is true does the sprite follow the instruction <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/go-to-mouse-x-mouse-y.png" class="block" alt="go to mouse x and mouse y">. If <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/distance-to-mouse-less-than-20.png" class="block" alt="distance to mouse less than 20"> is <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false"/>, the sprite is not instructed to move. </p>
       <p>Computer scientists refer to blocks like <code>if</code> as <strong>conditionals</strong>. Blocks that report <code>true</code> when a condition is met and  <code>false</code> when it is not met are called "predicates." These two special values, true and false, are called Boolean values (named after the great logician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole" target="blank">George Boole</a>).  These values are represented in <span class="snap">snap</span>  by the blocks <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true"/> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false"/>.</p>

		<img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/predicate-returning-boolean.gif" alt="5 > 3 returns 'true'"/>

		<p>These functions are like yes/no questions. Predicate  functions in <span class="snap">snap</span>  will always have the pointed, hexagonal shape: <img src="/bjc-r/img/cond/demo-predicate-block.png" alt="a predicate block"/>.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
        	<div class="sidenote">
        	  <div>Some  predicates, like <code>turbo mode?</code>, will not yet make sense, but you are likely to be able to make a good guess about many others.</div></div>
            <ol start="3">
            	<li>Look in the "Sensing" and "Operations" tabs, find the <em>predicate</em> blocks, and talk with your pair programmer about what you think they might do. </li>
            	<li>Look in the "Control" tab to find what other <em>conditionals</em> are there. Again discuss how you think those might be used.</li>
            </ol>
