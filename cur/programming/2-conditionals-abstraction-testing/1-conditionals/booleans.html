		<h2>Getting Started</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
        <ul>
        	<li>In #3, show the predicate blocks. And give some non-examples.</li>
            <li>Let's us the term "procedures" for subroutines where appropriate.</li>
            <li>
            	We could:
                  <ul>
                    <li>We could introduce a few logic puzzles with if-then (maybe it could be in the TG as a lesson opener). Or a choose your own adventure style activity. </li>
                    
                    <li>Experiement with prediates and do a few problems and then do Bowen's idea before.</li>
                  </ul>
            </li>
            <li>MF: Maybe students could write their own choose their own activity at the end of the lesson.</li>
            <li>MF: Maybe we could keep the truth tables but put them in the lesson openers in the TG.</li>
            <li>PG: One possitbility: start with the traffic light then go to the plurals.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        <p>This code <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/follow-that-mouse.png" alt="Follow That Mouse Script"/>  appeared in  &lt;link to Lab XX&gt;. </p>
        <p>The following scripts use one new  block, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/IfElse_72x101.png" alt="If Else">, which you can find in the yellow Control tab, and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/X-Position_104x22.png" alt="x position"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/direction_94x22.png" alt="direction">, which you can find in the blue Motion tab.</p>
          <ol>
            <li> Construct each script and try it out.<br />
              <div class = "sidenote"> When the sprite is pointing in the direction 127°, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Direction-mod-60_203x28.png" alt="127 mod 60"> reports 7, because when you divide 127 by 60 the remainder is 7. <br /> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/227DividedBy60.png" alt="127 divided by 60 leaving a remainder of 7"> <br /> 
    When the sprite is pointing in direction 90, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/direction-mod-30.png" alt="direction mod 30"> reports 0 <br />
    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/90-divided-by-30.png" alt="90 divided by 30 with zero remainder">.<br /></div>

            <li>Now try to create scripts that draw these pictures:</li>
                
    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Challenge1.png" alt="Challenge 2: circle with northwest circumference red and the rest green"> 
    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Challenge4.png" alt="Circle with southeast circumference thin and the rest thick"> 
    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Challenge3.png" alt="Circle with southwest corner thick and the rest thin"> 
    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Challenge4.png"  alt="Circle with the southeast corner thin and the rest thick"></p>
            <li>And try to create a script that has this behavior.</li>

        <div class="takeNote">
       	    <div>  Blocks, like <code>greater than</code>, that report <code>true</code> when a condition is met and <code>false</code> when it is not met are called "predicates." <p> <img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/predicate-returning-boolean.gif" alt="5 > 3 returns 'true'"/></p> In <span class="snap">snap</span>, these functions have the hexagonal shape: <img src="/bjc-r/img/cond/demo-predicate-block.png" alt="a predicate block"/>.  Predicate functions are like questions that can be answered with <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. The two special values  are represented in <span class="snap">snap</span>  by the blocks <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true"/> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false"/>. They are called Boolean values, named after the great logician George Boole. </div></div>
