		<h2><code>If</code> and <code>If-else</code></h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
        <ul>
        	<li>JK: #1 requires a lot of detailed typing. I suggest giving them that code pre-built because I feel like people will get caught up in the details. And you kind of want the two codes side-by-side to compare them. Also, people have to interpret the code in order to interact with it on the screen, so I think it's ok that they're not entering the information directly. Or, maybe give them the pieces to assemble together so that people see that the if-else block is a separate entity from an if block.
            	<ul>
                	<li>MF: I agree that a pre-built XML file is the right thing to provide here. Building these is a time-sink with little benefit.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>JK: I'm confused by information about mod showing up both in the sidenote and the orange box. They read similarly to me (though I get they're not saying exactly the same thing), and neither of them is a great introduction to mod (I think we can assume that this is the first time students and some teachers are encountering this idea).
            	<ul>
                	<li>MF: Yeah, we could definitely offer a <em>whole lab</em> on mod and it would be time well-spent both for mathematics and computer science learning.</li>
                	<li>Team: maybe not so much of an emphasis on it at this point; maybe justa dialogue saying briefly "this is how you skip by 2's or 3's".</li>
                    <li>Al: In a sidenote maybe we could just write out a long division problem</li>
                    <li>AC: 14 &divide; 3</span> is 4.666&hellip;. I know this is picky, but it should say something like ``the remainder when 14 is divided by 3 is 2'' or even ``14=4&times;3 + 2''. And ``we are only using integers'' should be ``we are only using positive integers.''</li>
            	</ul>
    </li>
            <li>JK: The text between the FYTD boxes is confusing. I initially read it to mean that we didn't need the "else" statement, which you do. It would make more sense if students ALSO saw the script built with the additional if and then saw that it does the same thing as the script with if/else.</li>
            <li>AC: Is there any reason not to make these reporters rather than commands?</span></li>
            <li>JK: I predict that no one will predict before #3. And I don't think they really need to. I think it's more fun to actually just run them, see what they do, then think about it. I think we should only ask them to predict when we really want them to predict.</li>
            <li>JK: In the Teacher notes for this lab, I would suggest that teachers display their grid and show #3 and #4 if students don't get absolute value. And I would also suggest that they not TEACH absolute value (as they might in algebra) because it's really more about distance not the boring algebra stuff. Actually, I might revise the sidenote and NOT talk about abs(-10) being 10 so much as showing a picture. Maybe say "-10 and 10 are both a distance of 10 from 0 so <code>abs of -10</code> and <code>abs of 10</code> are both 10" with a number line picture?</li>
            <li>JK: Mystery3 requires some support, I think. Teachers definitely needed it during the NYC PD week. I might suggest keeping only 3, 4, and 6 on this page, and then actually moving #5 to the next page and sitting a little longer with it. Teachers had a hard time because they didn't know what mod meant. And even after they knew the block was saying "if divisible by 4", they didn't see WHAT was being divided by 4 (the counter). And they didn't know why the counter was going from 1 to 43. What helped them was to suggest they set the counter to 4, then 8, then ask things like "if it goes to 10, what would you expect?" Or, they could play with the mod - what would you expect if it were changed to mod 20? Maybe a problem could show this script except with i going from 1 to 4, then 1 to 11, then showing the result of going 1-43 and asking them to make it? And then maybe show a result with a different mod and ask them to produce that one too.</li>
            <li>JK: Actually, I would make Mystery3 into a dialogue between Alphie and Betty. And they can say something like "this would be useful if you want something to happen every 3rd time" so that people see a more general use for mod.</li>
            <li>Why does <span class="snap">snap</span> use "say" instead of "report"?</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol> 
                <div class="sidenote">When the sprite asks its question, you will see an "answer space" at the bottom of the stage. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/SpriteAskingQuestion,withAnswerBox.png" alt="Answer space on stage"> <p>Type your answer there and  click the check box (or hit return). </p></div>
                <li>These two scripts are almost the same. Build them both, experiment with them, and explain the difference in their behavior. </li>

How are you?&quot; If answer is &quot;happy&quot; say &quot;I'm glad.&quot; Say &quot;Oh...&quot;">
                <li> Here is another pair of scripts. Again, they are similar.  Build them. One does the wrong thing. Explain why.</li>
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/EvenOrOdd correct 163&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;148 pixels.png" alt="Even Or Odd with If Else"> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/EvenOrOdd, incorrect 163&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;131 pixels.png" alt="Even Or Odd with just If">
            
                <div class="sidenote"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/n mod 2 = 0, 138 × 23 pixels.png" alt="n mod 2 = 0"/> is the same as asking if <em>x</em> is divisible by 2 (i.e. whether <em>x</em> is even).</div>       
                <div class="takeNote">
                    <div class="comment">Al has some other comments on the mathematics in this sidenotes. Maybe 12 mod 5 is better or 7 mod 3.</div>
                    The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mod.png" alt="() mod ()"/> block  reports the remainder when the first input is divided by the second (and we are using only positive integers). For example, <code>14 mod 3</code> reports 2 because 14 &divide; 3 leaves a remainder of 2. When a number is divisible by another, the remainder is 0.
                </div>       	
            </ol>
        </div>
<p>In that second example, we didn't need to have an additional "if," because all whole numbers are either even or odd. If the boolean expression (<code>n mod 2 = 0</code>) evaluates to <code>false</code>, we know that the number is not even, so it must be odd.</p>
		
<div class="forYouToDo">
<p>Below are several blocks that use <code>if</code> and <code>if-else</code>. </p>
<p>Predict what each one will do and discuss it with your pair programmer. <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /></p>
<p>Afterward, try running each of the blocks, which can be found <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/conditionals/predict-if-functions.xml">here</a>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><div>Two of these scripts use the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/abs.png" alt="abs ()"/> block. This block offers several mathematical functions. In the palette, it shows up as <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/sqrt-of-10.png" alt="sqrt (10)"/>. To select other functions, click the drop-down menu. "abs" is short for "absolute value." The absolute value of a number is that number's distance from zero. For example, <code>abs(-10)</code> and <code>abs(10)</code> are both 10.  <code>abs(-2.5)</code> is 2.5.</div></div>
