		<div class="sidenoteBig">There are different traditions on how to name predicates. Using question marks in the name, as in <code>even?</code>, is hard to miss, but some people don't like it because in English the question mark would go at the end: <code>is (n) even?</code>. And in any case English questions don't go after the word <code>if</code>. But don't try too hard to read or write any programming language as if it were English.</div>
		
        <p><em>You</em> know that the code <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/if-n-mod-2-equals-0.png" alt="if-n-mod-2-equals-0"> means &quot;if <em>n</em> is even,&quot; but programs are much easier to read and debug when the code  <em>says</em> what it means, something like <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/if-even-n.png"  alt="if even? n"> or  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/if-n-is-even.png" alt="if n is even">. </p>

    				You have just created a <strong>predicate</strong>, a block that reports only <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> depending on its input. <strong>Conditional</strong> blocks—<code>if-else</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>repeat until</code>, <code>wait until</code>—use the condition you are testing to control the behavior of your program. 
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    Your <code>even? (n)</code> block reported the result of one of <span class="snap">snap</span>'s built-in predicates, <code>=</code>, which tested to see if <code>n mod 2</code> equaled 0.</div>

                    <p>To create realistic dialogues, a program  needs to adjust some words to fit others. For example, it needs to know  when to use <em><strong>a </strong></em> or <em><strong> an</strong></em>.  <strong><em>A</em></strong> peach or <strong><em>an</em></strong> peach?  <strong><em>A</em></strong> apple or <strong><em>an</em></strong> apple?</p>
					<p>To decide, it  needs a predicate that tests the next letter to see if it's a vowel. It should work like this:</p>
					<p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/newvowel.gif" alt="predicate vowel? tests e and reports true, and tests b and reports false"></p>
					<p>There are many ways to create a block like this. Here's one way, started for you. </p>
					<p>Complete it, test it, and save it for future use. </p>
					<div class="sidenoteBig">
						Again, the block is defined with the hexagonal <strong>predicate</strong> shape because it outputs only <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Choose the shape when you first define the block.

        <p>The solution to problem 1 needs only one <code>if</code> statement, because all integers are either even or odd. If the boolean expression (<code>n mod 2 = 0</code>) evaluates to <code>false</code>,  the number is not even, so it must be odd. </p>
        <p>The way problem 4 was approached above used several <code>if</code> statements because it tested for several conditions. </p>

					<strong>Analyzing:</strong>  To solve the puzzles in problems 7 and 8, you will need to understand how the conditionals (<code>if-else</code> and <code>repeat until</code>) control each of these scripts. Construct  and analyze them with your pair programmer, experimenting with the conditions until you are sure you can explain exactly how this code does what it does.
