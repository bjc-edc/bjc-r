		<h2>Creating Predicates</h2>
        
        <div class="todo">
        	NOTE: There were numbering issues on this page at one point. This has been fixed, so the references below may not be correct. --MF
            <ul>
                <li>On TTA, I have run into countless teachers who insist that "zero is neither odd nor even." We should probably clarify that zero is even in the TG. --MF</li>
                <li>In TG, also clarify that the a/an rule the students are using are about spelling, and the real English rule is about pronunciation: we say <em>an</em> umbrella but <em>a</em> unicorn, and we say <em>a</em> house, but <em>an </em>hour. This doesn't need to be said in class, or taught to students, but is something the teacher should be aware of <em>if</em> it comes up. Or it could be a introduction into how very complicated language processing is and how much programs like Siri must know in order to get things right.</li>
            </ul>

       To make progress with Tic Tac Toe, your program needs to  <em>control</em> which action happens at which time. That is the topic of this lab. You will also start a new mini-project about  English words and simple phrases that will give you  practice with <em>conditional statements</em> and with breaking complex tasks into meaningful parts.
       

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">

		<!--  <div class="sidenoteBig">There are different traditions on how to name predicates.  Using question marks in the name, as in <code>even?</code>, is hard to miss, but some people don't like it because in English the question mark would go at the end: <code>is (n) even?</code>. And in any case English questions don't go after the word <code>if</code>. But don't try too hard to read or write any programming language as if it were English.</div> -->
		<p> <em>You</em> know that the code <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/if-n-mod-2-equals-0.png" alt="if-n-mod-2-equals-0"> means "if <em>n</em> is even," but programs are much easier to read and debug when the code  <em>says</em> what it means, something like <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/if-even-n.png"  alt="if even? n"> or  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/if-n-is-even.png" alt="if n is even">. </p>
				<li>The video below shows <em>almost</em> all you need to do to define <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/even-predicate.png" alt="the even predicate">, but an important step is missing. <br />
                  
                    <ul> 
                      <li>You must choose the hexagonal shape to define your block as a <em>predicate</em> rather than a command. </li> 
                        <li>You must use  the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/report.png" alt="report"> block to report the result.</li>
                      <li><strong>What else must be done before clicking OK?</strong></li>
                      <div class="sidenote">The video also shows a different (optional) way to create an input name. You can, if you like, type the title text and input name at the same time, and <em>then</em> change the part that you want to use as an input name  by clicking on it and choosing "input name." Use whatever way you like best.</div>

              <li>
                        <strong>Test</strong> your new block to make sure it works properly.</li>

                    <img class="imageRight" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/use-a-or-an-with-(word).gif" alt="use-a-or-an-with-(word)">
                    <p>To create realistic dialogues, a program  needs to adjust some words to fit others. For example, it needs to know  when to use <em><strong>a </strong></em> or <em><strong> an</strong></em>.  <strong><em>A</em></strong> peach or <strong><em>an</em></strong> peach?  <strong><em>A</em></strong> apple or <strong><em>an</em></strong> apple?</p>
					<p>To decide, it  needs a predicate that tests the next letter to see if it's a vowel. It should work like this:</p>
					<p><img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/newvowel.gif" alt="predicate vowel? tests e and reports true, and tests b and reports false"></p>
					<p>There are many ways to create a block like this. Here's one way, started for you. </p><div class="sidenoteBig">
						Because <code>vowel?</code> outputs only <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, remember to choose the hexagonal <strong>predicate</strong> shape when you first define the block. 
						<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/make-a-predicate-block.png"  alt="make a predicate block by choosing the correct shape"></p>
					</div>
					<p>Complete it, test it, and save it for future use. </p>
					
					<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/vowel-definition.png" alt="vowel definition"></p>

				<li> <div class="sidenoteBig"> <img  class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/make-a-reporter-block.png" width="180" alt="make a reporter block"> When you define this block, you will need to choose the rounded <strong>reporter</strong> shape.</div>  Use <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/vowel-letter(1)of.png" alt="vowel(letter(1)of"> to define a block <code> use "a" or "an" with </code>, that takes a word as input and reports either "a" or "an." </li>
				<li>Now, use that block you just created to define a block <code>join &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot; with (noun)</code> that works like this:<br />
				  <img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/join-a-or-an-with.gif" alt="join-a-or-an-with" title="join-a-or-an-with" /><br />
                    
                    <p>You will need to use <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join-words().png"  alt="join words"> with <em>two</em> inputs. The block  shows a slot for only <em>one</em> input, but you can use the arrows <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/input-arrows.png"  alt="input arrows"> to increase or decrease the number of inputs.</p>
				</li>
                <li>Save this project before you continue.  You will use these blocks on the next page.</li>
			</ol>
	</div>
        
        <p>The solution to problem 1 needs only one <code>if</code> statement, because all integers are either even or odd. If the boolean expression (<code>n mod 2 = 0</code>) evaluates to <code>false</code>,  the number is not even, so it must be odd. </p>
        <p>The way problem 4 was approached above used several <code>if</code> statements because it tested for several conditions. </p>

                        <p> In how many other directions will the predicate <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/direction-mod-30-equals-0.png" alt="direction-mod-30-equals-0"> report <code>true</code>?</p>

					<strong>Analyzing:</strong>  To solve the puzzles in problems 9 and 10, you will need to understand how the conditionals (<code>if-else</code> and <code>repeat until</code>) control each of these scripts. Construct  and analyze them with your pair programmer, experimenting with the conditions until you are sure you can explain exactly how this code does what it does.

                    <ol>
                        <li>What if, instead of <code>direction mod <em>whatever</em> = 0</code>, you used <code>direction mod <em>whatever</em> = 20</code>? </li>
                        <li>What if you tried <code>direction mod <em>23</em> = 0</code>?</li>
                        <li>What if you use <code>turn 2 degrees</code> or <code>turn 7 degrees</code> instead of <code>turn 1</code>?</li>
                    </ol>
				</li>
				<li>Two puzzles: For each picture, create a script (or modify one you already have) that keeps the sprite moving in a circle drawing that picture.</li>
