                <li>GitHub Feedback: The report block was not introduced prior to this page. It needs some explanation. Also, in item #6 that piece of code reports a joined word. What receives it?</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 10/21/15: put the n in side the mod bar when making the even? block</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 10/24/15: on problem number 6, I think that code with the blank part in the middle is confusing. It looks like there should only be 3 If blocks which is incorrect.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 10/29/15: For the block for number 6, is there a particular starting direction desired for the sprite? otherwise, students results are different. (I think this is about #8 --MF)</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 10/30/15: For number 8 on this page, was it the intention that they write a script that resets the sprite to direction 90 every 2nd time the sprite points in the direction 180? I ended up just having them clear the circle for ever complete revolution from the pointer being in the direction of 90.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 10/30/15: No doubt you are already well aware, that the choice of 'a' or 'an' depends on the initial sound of the next word. The sound often coincides with the letter, but you would not say 'an ukelele', 'an honest mistake' etc. But, maybe this serves as an introduction to the difficulties in forming plurals, which is coming up.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 11/8/15: described more (Not verbose, but I included it because I think it's clear what they mean. --MF)</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 12/16/15: #7 is confusing (use indefinite article) (e.g. &quot;Now, define a block use indefinite article (noun) that works like this:&quot;) . It doesn't say what block to use to check if the word starts with a vowel. This is key to getting the (use indefinite article) block to work. There needs to be a hint just like there was a hint to use (join words) for inputs.</li>
                <li>On TTA, I have run into countless teachers who insist that "zero is neither odd nor even." We should probably clarify that zero is even in the TG. --MF</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 1/18/16: On item #7 ["Now, define a block use indefinite article (noun) that works like this..."], students haven't learned letter 1 of word explicitly yet. It was just a block they saw when running the for loops. They may need a hint here. You give them join words but not the letter of block.</li>

       <em>You</em> know that the code <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/if-n-mod-2-equals-0.png" alt="if-n-mod-2-equals-0"> means "if <em>n</em> is even," but programs are much easier to read and debug when the code  <em>says</em> what it means, something like <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/if-even-n.png"  alt="if even? n"> or  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/if-n-is-even.png" alt="if n is even">.

		<div class="sidenoteBig">There are different traditions on how to name predicates. Using question marks in the name, as in <code>even?</code>, is hard to miss, but some people don't like it because in English the question mark would go at the end: <code>is (n) even?</code>. And in any case English questions don't go after the word <code>if</code>. But don't try too hard to read or write any programming language as if it were English.</div>
		
				<li>
                    Create the <code>even? (n)</code> block.<br />
                    <div class="sidenote">The video also shows a different (optional) way to create an input name. You can, if you like, type the title text and input name at the same time, and <em>then</em> change the part that you want to use as an input name  by clicking on it and choosing "input name." Use whatever way you like best.</div>
                    The video below shows <em>almost</em> all you need to do to define <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/even-predicate.png" alt="the even predicate">, but an important step is missing. 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>You must define your block to be a <em>predicate</em> rather than a command. </li>
                        <li>You must use  the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/report.png" alt="report"> block to report the result.</li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Test</strong> your new block to make sure it works properly.</li>

                    <p>To create realistic dialogues, a program  needs to adjust some words to fit others. For example, it needs to know  when to use <em><strong>a </strong></em> or <em><strong> an</strong></em>.  <strong><em>A</em></strong> peach or <strong><em>an</em></strong> peach?  <strong><em>A</em></strong> apple or <strong><em>an</em></strong> apple?</p>
					<p>To decide, it  needs a predicate that tests the next letter to see if it's a vowel. It should work like this:</p>
					<p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/newvowel.gif" alt="predicate vowel? tests e and reports true, and tests b and reports false"></p>
					<p>There are many ways to create a block like this. Here's one way, started for you. </p>
					<p>Complete it, test it, and save it for future use. </p>
					<div class="sidenoteBig">
						Again, the block is defined with the hexagonal <strong>predicate</strong> shape because it outputs only <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Choose the shape when you first define the block.

					<div class="todo">GitHub Feedback: The vowel block doesn't have much context. I found out that it relates to the Take It Further section for words that end in y, but there should be a link or description of some sort added to clarify this.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li> Now, define a block <code>combine &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot; with (noun)</code> that works like this:<br />

                    <p>You will need to use <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join-words().png"  alt="join words"> with <em>two</em> inputs.

        <p>The solution to problem 1 needs only one <code>if</code> statement, because all integers are either even or odd. If the boolean expression (<code>n mod 2 = 0</code>) evaluates to <code>false</code>,  the number is not even, so it must be odd. </p>
        <p>The way problem 4 was approached above used several <code>if</code> statements because it tested for several conditions. </p>

					<strong>Analyzing:</strong>  To solve the puzzles in problems 7 and 8, you will need to understand how the conditionals (<code>if-else</code> and <code>repeat until</code>) control each of these scripts. Construct  and analyze them with your pair programmer, experimenting with the conditions until you are sure you can explain exactly how this code does what it does.
