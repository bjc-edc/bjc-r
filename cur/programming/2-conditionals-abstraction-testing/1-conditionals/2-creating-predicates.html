		<h2>Creating Predicates</h2>
        
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol> 
               <li> These two blocks are quite similar.  Build them both. Which one works properly?
                    <p> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Block_even-or-odd_if(incorrect).png" alt="Block title Even Or Odd, input n; if (n mod 2 equals 0) [say (join n with text is even) for 1 second]; say (join n with text is odd) for 1 second">
                     <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Block_even-or-odd_if-else(correct).png" alt="Block title even or odd, input n; if (n mod 2 equals 0) [say (join n with text is even) for 1 second]  else [say  (join n with text is odd) for 1 second]"></p>
               </li>
                   <div class="takeNote">
                      <p><strong>mod: </strong>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mod.png" alt="() mod ()"/> block  reports the remainder when the first input is divided by the second (and we are using only positive integers). For example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/17-mod-5-reporting-2.png"  alt="17 mod 5 reports 2"> because  when 17 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2. </p>
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                      <p>When one number divides another evenly, the remainder is 0 <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/15-mod-5-reporting-0.png" alt="15-mod-5-reporting-0">.  So the predicate <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/n mod 2 = 0, 138 × 23 pixels.png" alt="n mod 2 = 0"/> reports <code>true</code> if <em>n</em> is divisible by 2 (i.e., if <em>n</em> is even) and <code>false</code> if <em>n</em> is odd.</p>
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                      <p>In mathematical notation, we write <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/17-mod-5-reporting-2.png"  alt="17 mod 5 reports 2"> as 17 (mod 5) &#x2261 2 and we write <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/15-mod-5-reporting-0.png" alt="15-mod-5-reporting-0"> as 15 (mod 5) &#x2261 0.</p>
                   </div>
               <li >For an upcoming project, it will be useful to create a predicate that tests a letter to see if it is a vowel. It should work like this: 
                   <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/newvowel.gif" alt="predicate vowel? tests e and reports true, and tests b and reports false"></p>
               
                 <p>There are many ways to create a block like this. Here is one way, started for you. Complete it, test it, and save it for future use. </p>
                      <div class="sidenote">
                            Notice that the block is defined with the hexagonal <strong>predicate</strong> shape because it outputs only <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. You choose  the shape when you are first making the block. 
                            <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/make-a-predicate-block.png"  alt="make a predicate block by choosing the correct shape"></p>
                      </div>
                 <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/vowel-definition.png" alt="vowel definition"></p>
               </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
<p>In problem 1, we needed only one <code>if</code> statement, because all integers are either even or odd. If the boolean expression (<code>n mod 2 = 0</code>) evaluates to <code>false</code>, we know that the number is not even, so it must be odd. But in problem 2, we needed several <code>if</code> statements because we were testing for several conditions. </p>
		
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="3">
            <li> <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> 
                 <div class = "sidenote">

So, the predicate <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/direction-mod-60-equals-0.png" alt="direction-mod-60-equals-0"> will be true only when the <code>direction</code> is 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300. 
                     <p><em><strong>n</strong></em> <code>mod</code> <em><strong>m</strong></em> reports the remainder when <em>n</em> is divided by <em>m</em>.  So, when the sprite's direction is not a multiple of 60, 
                        <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Direction-mod-60_203x28.png" alt="127 mod 60"> reports a number other than 0 (and less than 60). For example, if the sprite is pointing in the direction 127&deg;, 
                        <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Direction-mod-60_203x28.png" alt="127 mod 60"> reports 7.</p>

                     <p>When the sprite is pointing in direction 90, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/direction-mod-30.png" alt="direction mod 30"> reports 0. </p>

                     <p> In how many other directions will the predicate <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/direction-mod-30-equals-0.png" width="278" height="34" alt="direction-mod-30-equals-0"> report <code>true</code>?
                     </p>
                </div>
            To solve the puzzles in problems 5 and 6, you will need to understand how the <strong>predicates</strong> (the <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> tests) in the conditionals <code>if-else</code> and <code>repeat until</code> controls each of these scripts. Construct each script and analyze it with your pair programmer, experimenting with the conditions until you are sure you can explain exactly how this code does what it does.

            </li>
            <li>Two puzzles: For each picture, create a script (or modify one you already have) that keeps the sprite moving in a circle drawing that picture.
            </li>

                 </p>
            <li>And try to create a script that has this behavior.

            <ol start="6"> 
                <li>Problems 4 and 5 can be solved with  conditionals or without. Whichever way you solved it, figure out how to solve it the other way.</li>
                <li>In problem 6, the sprite always says "Another hour has passed." How boring! Make it say <em>what</em> time it has just reached, like this.</li>
                    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/clock.gif" alt="animated clock that says the hour"></p>

                  <p><strong>Data types: </strong> <span class="snap">snap</span> lets you manipulate a variety of <strong>data types</strong>.

                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p> The next two problems use a new data type, <strong>lists</strong>, and show how useful lists can be. The problems are optional, just a first taste of an interesting new idea. In Unit 3, you will study <strong>lists</strong> in depth. </p>
      </div>
            <ol start="8">
                <li> It would be convenient if we could just list the vowels and then test to see if a particular letter was in that list.  <span class="snap">snap</span> makes that a snap! Experiment with these blocks to see what they do.
