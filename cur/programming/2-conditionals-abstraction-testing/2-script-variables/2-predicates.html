                <li>MF: I'm missing the whole "predicates are a special kind of reporter" piece here.</li>
                <li>MF: I guess, overall, I'm missing a sense of where I'm going and why I'm doing this as a reader. I feel like I'm just reading "you'll use this later" content and doing lots of little tasks.</li>
                <li>MF: Our students might not be familiar with factorials and may not be solid enough with algebra to be confident with the presentation of 2a.</li>

        <p>
            <span class="snap">snap</span> has a "greater than" operator (<code>&gt;</code>), an "equal" operator (<code>=</code>), and
            a "less than" operator (<code>&lt;</code>) built in, but doesn't have a "greater than or equal to" (<code>&gt;=</code>)
            operator.

                            <div class="sidenote">Operators like <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/a times b 94 × 27 pixels.png" alt="a times b">  that stand in between their two inputs are called <em><u>in</u>fix</em> operators. Operators like <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/sqrt of 120 × 28 pixels.png" alt="sqrt of"> that stand their inputs are called <em><u>pre</u>fix</em> operators. When we write <em>n</em>! to mean &quot;<em>n</em> factorial,&quot; the &quot;!&quot; is a <em><u>post</u>fix</em> operator&mdash;it comes after its input <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/postfix factorial 47&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;27 pixels.png" width="47" height="27" alt="n factorial">.</div> 
							Because you want the block's name<code>&gt;=</code>to go between the two input slots you'll have to use the left plus sign in the Block Editor.</li>

                        	You'll probably find the Boolean operators helpful, although they're not entirely necessary:<br />

         			There are several correct ways to do this! As long as your block gives the right <code> true</code> and <code> false</code> answers, it's correct.
