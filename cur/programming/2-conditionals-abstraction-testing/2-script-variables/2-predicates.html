            <ul>
                <li>MF: I'm missing the whole "predicates are a special kind of reporter" piece here.</li>
                <li>MF: I guess, overall, I'm missing a sense of where I'm going and why I'm doing this as a reader. I feel like I'm just reading "you'll use this later" content and doing lots of little tasks.</li>
                <li>MF: Our students might not be familiar with factorials and may not be solid enough with algebra to be confident with the presentation of 2a.</li>

        <p>
            <span class="snap">snap</span> has a "greater than" operator (<code>&gt;</code>), an "equal" operator (<code>=</code>), and
            a "less than" operator (<code>&lt;</code>) built in, but doesn't have a "greater than or equal to" (<code>&gt;=</code>)
            operator.

                	Build <code>>=</code> and test it well to make sure it does what you expect. Here are three things worth knowing.
                	<ol>
					    <li>When you type the title of this block in the initial <code> Make a block</code> dialog, make sure that you choose the hexagonal <code> predicate</code> block shape.</li>

							<div class="sidenote">Operators like <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/a times b 94 × 27 pixels.png" alt="a times b">  that stand in between their two inputs are called <em><u>in</u>fix</em> operators. Operators like <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/sqrt of 120 × 28 pixels.png" alt="sqrt of"> that stand their inputs are called <em><u>pre</u>fix</em> operators. When we write <em>n</em>! to mean &quot;<em>n</em> factorial,&quot; the &quot;!&quot; is a <em><u>post</u>fix</em> operator&mdash;it comes after its input <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/postfix factorial 47&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;27 pixels.png" width="47" height="27" alt="n factorial">.</div> 
							Because you want the block's name<code>&gt;=</code>to go between the two input slots you'll have to use the left plus sign in the Block Editor.</li>
	    				<li>
                        	You'll probably find the Boolean operators helpful, although they're not entirely necessary:<br />

	    				</li>
	   
					</ol>
         			There are several correct ways to do this! As long as your block gives the right <code> true</code> and <code> false</code> answers, it's correct.

         		<li>
                	Here is one way to create a <code>factorial</code> block that takes a positive integer <em>n</em> and reports the value 1 &times; 2 &times; 3 &times; ... &times; (<em>n</em> - 1) &times; <em>n</em>. <br />
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/factorial script 226 × 258 pixels.png" alt="factorial script">
                    <ol>
                    	<li>Create a block <code>triangular number n</code> that takes <em>n</em> as input and reports 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (<em>n</em> - 1) + <em>n</em>.</li>
                        <li>Create <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/sum from a to b 170 × 27 pixels.png" alt="sum from a to b"> that works this way: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/sum from 3 to 7 170 × 27 pixels.png" alt="sum from 3 to 7"> reports the sum 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7.</li>
