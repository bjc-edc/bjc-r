<h2>Building a useful collection of predicates</h2>
    <p>Some tests—for example, a test to see if a number is even or if a letter is a vowel—are needed so often that you won't want to re-create them each time you need them. In this activity, you will create a set of tools that you may use often, especially for complicated programming tasks.  </p>
        <p>
     You've already built a predicate <code>vowel?</code> to test for vowels. In the same lesson, you built a block that <em>says</em> whether a number is even or odd, but not a <em>predicate</em> that you could use inside <code>if</code> to choose different actions depending on whether a number is even or odd. <span class="snap">snap</span> has a built-in test to see if something is a number, but not a test to see if the number is an integer, and often you will want that.

              <li>Create the predicate <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/predicate-even-number.png" alt="predicate to test if a number is even"> to report <code>true</code> when its input it even and <code>false</code> otherwise.</li>
        	  <li><span class="snap">snap</span> has a "greater than" operator (<code>&gt;</code>), an "equal" operator (<code>=</code>), and a "less than" operator (<code>&lt;</code>) built in, but doesn't have a "greater than or equal to" (<code>&gt;=</code>) operator.

                            <li>To set the block's name <code>&gt;=</code>  between the two input slots, use the left plus sign in the Block Editor. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/left-plus-sign.png" alt="left plus sign"></li>
                            <li>You may find one or more of these Boolean operators helpful:

                  <p>There are several correct ways to do this! As long as your block gives the right <code> true</code> and <code> false</code> answers, it's correct.</p>

You could write this  without your <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/weekend.png" alt="weekend?"> block, but it'll be much easier (and cleaner code!) if you use <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/weekend.png" alt="weekend?"> as part of this new block.</li>
