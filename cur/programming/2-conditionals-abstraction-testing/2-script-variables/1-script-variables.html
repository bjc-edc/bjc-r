		<h2>Script Variables</h2>
        <!-- <div class="todo">
        	<ul>
                <li>MF: I worry that the mathematics required on this page would be non-trivial for our students. What if they haven't had any geometry?</li>
            </ul>
        </div> -->
        <p>   <div class="sidenote"> A script variable  exists only while the script is running. </div> 
              Sometimes you will want a variable in your script and will want to set its value. 
        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
           <ol>
                <div class="sidenote">In this script, the value of <code>sides</code> is used twice, once in the <code>repeat</code> block to say how many times the <code>move</code>-and-<code>turn</code> combination should be done, and once in computing the angle through which to <code>turn</code> for each side. Why bother with the script variable? Problem 6 below asks you why we can not just use the <code>pick random</code> in those two places.
          		</div>
               <li> Create the following script, which draws polygons with a random number of sides. The video below shows how to create, name, and set the value of a script variable. 
               </li>

    </p>
        
         <div class="sidenote"> To create a script variable, use <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/scriptvar.png" alt="script variables" /> (in the variables tab, of course). To name the variable, click on the orange <em><code>a</code></em> and type the name you want to use. To set the value of your variable, use 
		<img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/set.png" alt="set" />; click on the down-arrow to select the variable name you want (in this example, there is only one to choose). Then set its value. </div>
        <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/ScriptVariables.gif" alt="movie showing how to choose the name of a script variable and set its initial value"></p>
     
      <li>Try running the script (by clicking the green flag) several times to see what shapes it draws.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Check your understanding:</strong> Why does it make sense to start the range of possible random numbers at 3?</li>
            <li><strong>Check your understanding:</strong> Where did the formula <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/360-over-sides.png" alt="360/sides" /> come from?</li>
            <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Modify the script so that it also picks a <em>size</em> randomly, from 30 through 60 using <em>only multiples of 10</em>.
                <p>There are two ways to add a second script variable.  You could add a second <code>script variables</code> block like this 
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/script-variables-sides-script-variables-size.png" alt="script-variables-sides-script-variables-size"> or you could extend the one block, using the right-arrow <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/second-script-variables-movie.gif" alt="adding a second script variable"></p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Analyzing and debugging:</strong> Instead of setting a script variable, this script just uses the <code>pick random</code> block in the two places that need the random number. Before you build and run this script, try to figure out what is likely to go wrong.
                    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/bad-random-poly.png" alt="buggy random polygon" /></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                	Here is one way to create a <code>factorial</code> block that takes a positive integer <em>n</em> and reports the value 1 &times; 2 &times; 3 &times; ... &times; (<em>n</em> - 1) &times; <em>n</em>. 
                    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/factorial script 226 × 258 pixels.png" alt="factorial script"></p>
                    <ol>
                    	<li>Create a block <code>triangular number n</code> that takes <em>n</em> as input and reports 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (<em>n</em> - 1) + <em>n</em>.</li>
                        <li>Create <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/sum from a to b 170 × 27 pixels.png" alt="sum from a to b"> that works this way: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/sum from 3 to 7 170 × 27 pixels.png" alt="sum from 3 to 7"> reports the sum 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7.</li>
                    </ol>
             </li>
        </ol>
	</div>
    <!--    <p>Script variables can also be useful when a program  interacts with the user.</p>
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/converse.png" alt="conversation with ASK AND WAIT" />
<p>Note that this script has <em>two </em>script variables. The <code>script variables</code> block has a little right-arrow at the end:</p>
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/arrowhead.png" alt="arrowhead in block" />
        <p>If you click the arrowhead, a second orange variable oval will appear. Also, there will be left- and right-facing arrowheads. You can click these to adjust the number of variables you need.</p>
        <p>The join block also has arrowheads to control the number of input slots it has. In the text string inputs, both in <code>join</code> and in the <code>ask</code> blocks, the pale brown raised dots represent spaces. The brown dots don&rsquo;t appear in the text on the stage when the script is run. They&rsquo;re in the input slots so that you can easily see if there are multiple spaces in a row:</p>
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/multispace.png" alt="text input with multiple spaces in a row" />
        <p>and also so that you can distinguish between a completely empty input slot and one that has a space in it:</p>
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/emptyspace.png" alt="empty input text vs. space" />
        <!-- The below line seems to enforce bad programming habits.. why is it here?
        <!-- <p>Test yourself: Actually, that conversation script could have been made using just one variable. Which one, and how would you do it?</p> -->
