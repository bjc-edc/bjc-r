                <li>MF: I worry that the mathematics required on this page would be non-trivial for our students. What if they haven't had any geometry?</li>
                <li>MF: I love the animation, but will students know where to find the "sides" variarble for the blocks that use it?</li>
                <li><strong>GH Feedback:</strong> Here is one way to create a factorial block that takes a positive integer n and reports the value 1 × 2 × 3 × ... × (n - 1) × n. factorial block<br />Where is the for loop found? needs to be imported from a library - need some prompt help Import library &gt; iteration, composition?</li>

    <p>You have used variables that the <code>for</code> block <em>gave</em> you. <img src="/bjc-r/img/looping/squirral-script.png" alt="squiral script"></p>
              <p> You also <em>created</em> variables <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural-hat-block-and-first-line-only.png" alt="plural-hat-block-and-first-line-only"> as inputs to blocks that you made.</p>
    <p> <div class="sidenote"> A script variable  exists only while the script is running. </div>  Sometimes you will need <em>extra</em> variables to store information temporarily while your script is running. The

                <li>Create this script, which draws polygons with a random number of sides.

                    <strong>Challenge:</strong> Modify the script so that it also picks a <em>size</em> randomly, from 30 through 60 using <em>only multiples of 10</em>.
                    <div class="endnote">There are two ways to create a second script variable.  You could use another <code>script variables</code> block

                	<strong>Analyzing and debugging:</strong> Instead of setting a script variable, this script just uses the <code>pick random</code> block in the two places that need the random number. Before you build and run this script, try to figure out what is likely to go wrong.

                <li>
                    Here is one way to create a <code>factorial</code> block that takes a positive integer <em>n</em> and reports the value 1 &times; 2 &times; 3 &times; ... &times; (<em>n</em> - 1) &times; <em>n</em>. 
                    <p><a name="factorial" class="anchor"></a><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/factorial-block.png" alt="factorial block"></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Build this block and test it out. When the block's input is 4, its output should be 24 (because 1 &times; 2 &times; 3 &times; 4 = 24). And when the input is 5, you should see. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/5-factorial-with-result(120).png"  alt="five factorial with result (120)"></li>
                        <li>Dividing 5! by 4!, the result should be 5 <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/5-factorial-divided-by-4-factorial-with-result(5).png" alt="5-factorial-divided-by-4-factorial-with-result(5)"> because 4! is  1 &times; 2 &times; 3 &times; 4, and 5! is  1 &times; 2 &times; 3 &times; 4 &times;5. Using your block, check each of these computations&mdash;<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/4-factorial-divided-by-3-factorial.png"  alt="4-factorial-divided-by-3-factorial">, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/3-factorial-divided-by-2-factorial.png"  alt="3-factorial-divided-by-2-factorial">, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/2-factorial-divided-by-1-factorial.png"  alt="2-factorial-divided-by-1-factorial"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/1-factorial-divided-by-0-factorial.png"  alt="1-factorial-divided-by-0-factorial">&mdash;to see what it reports. </li>
                        <li>For mathematics to be consistent, we'd like all of these to follow the same pattern, but one of them does not. To fix the problem, we need to <em>define</em> 0! = 1. Edit your <code>n!</code> block to  report 1 if <em>n</em> = 0. Then fully test <code>n!</code> again to make sure it works as it should. </li>
                        <li><strong>Debugging: </strong>Obviously <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/cookie-factorial-bug.png" alt="cookie-factorial-bug"> should not work! Check to see what does happen.  Then edit your block and find a way to use <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/is-n-a-number.png" alt="is n a number"> to check that the input is a number and report some sensible result or message.</li>
                        <li> 
                            <strong>Analyzing code: </strong>In mathematics, factorial is defined only for positive integers and zero, so 3.7! would make no mathematical sense.  But <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/three-point-seven-factorial.png" alt="three-point-seven-factorial"> reports a result!
                            Find out what it reports and analyze what the block does so that you can figure out why <em>that</em> is the result.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Create a block <code>triangular number n</code> that takes <em>n</em> as input and reports 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (<em>n</em> - 1) + <em>n</em>. <code> triangular number 4</code> should report 10.  Define your block so that <code> triangular number 0</code> reports 0. </li>
                <li>
                    Create a <code>raise (n) to the power (b)</code> block that works like this:
                    <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/raise(2)-to-the-power(3)(with-result).png" alt="raise 2 to the power 3 (result = 8)"><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/raise(2)-to-the-power(5)(with-result).png" alt="raise 2 to the power 5 (result = 32)"><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/raise(3)-to-the-power(4)(with-result).png" alt="raise 3 to the power 4 (result = 81)"><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/raise(2)-to-the-power(1)(with-result).png" alt="raise 2 to the power 1 (result = 2)"></p>
                    <p>Make sure it also works for this case: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/raise(5)-to-the-power(0)(with-result).png" alt="raise 5 to the power 0 (result = 1)"></p>
                </li> 
                <li>Create <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/sum from a to b 170 × 27 pixels.png" alt="sum from a to b"> so that <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/sum from 3 to 7 170 × 27 pixels.png" alt="sum from 3 to 7"> reports the sum 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7, and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/sum from -3 to 3.png" alt="sum from -3 to 3"> reports the sum of -3 + -2 + -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3.</li>
                <li> <div class="sidenote">Recall that <code>n mod i</code> will tell you if <em>i</em> is a divisor of <em>n</em>.</div> Create a block that takes a whole number as input and checks  numbers from 1 through that input and counts the ones that evenly divide the input. So, for example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/number-of-divisors-of-8-with-result(4).png" alt="number of divisors of 8, with result = 4"> because, from 1 through 8, only the numbers 1, 2, 4, and 8 evenly divide 8.  <code>number-of-divisors 10</code> should also report 4 because, of the numbers from 1 through 10, only 1, 2, 5, and 10 are divisors of 10.</li>
                <li>Create a tool <code>digital sum</code> that adds up the digits in a number.  So, for example <code>digital sum 7</code> should report 7, and <code>digital sum 12</code> should report 3, and <code>digital sum 126</code> should report 9 (the sum of 1, 2 and 6).  You may find these blocks useful. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/letter-i-of-number.png" alt="fletter-i-of-number"> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/for-i=1-to-length-of-number.png" alt="for-i=1-to-length-of-number"> </li>

<p>Note that this script has <em>two </em>script variables. The <code>script variables</code> block has a little right-arrow at the end:</p>
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/arrowhead.png" alt="arrowhead in block" />
        <p>If you click the arrowhead, a second orange variable oval will appear. Also, there will be left- and right-facing arrowheads. You can click these to adjust the number of variables you need.</p>
        <p>The join block also has arrowheads to control the number of input slots it has. In the text string inputs, both in <code>join</code> and in the <code>ask</code> blocks, the pale brown raised dots represent spaces. The brown dots don&rsquo;t appear in the text on the stage when the script is run. They&rsquo;re in the input slots so that you can easily see if there are multiple spaces in a row:</p>
        <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/multispace.png" alt="text input with multiple spaces in a row" />
        <p>and also so that you can distinguish between a completely empty input slot and one that has a space in it:</p>
