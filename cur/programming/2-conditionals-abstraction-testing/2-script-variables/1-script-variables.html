                <li>MF: I worry that the mathematics required on this page would be non-trivial for our students. What if they haven't had any geometry?</li>
                <li>MF: I love the animation, but will students know where to find the "sides" variarble for the blocks that use it?</li>
                <li>GH Feedback: Here is one way to create a factorial block that takes a positive integer n and reports the value 1 × 2 × 3 × ... × (n - 1) × n. factorial block<br />Where is the for loop found? needs to be imported from a library - need some prompt help Import library &gt; iteration, composition?</li>
                <li>We need to mention that <code>set</code> is an "assignment statement". --MF and BH</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 9/8/15: Overall the organization is not the best in terms of directing students to different parts of the page...the different green boxes continue the sequence from previous boxes even though they are different questions/problems - doesn't make sense.<br />In number 5 in the second green box, you refer to step 3 and step 5, but the lines aren't numbered...maybe add line numbers in Snap! or in the course guides?</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 1/12/15: For you to do, 5a is confusing (where it says step 3 and step 5)</li>

        <p>You have used variables that the <code>for</code> block <em>gave</em> you. <img src="/bjc-r/img/looping/squirral-script.png" alt="squiral script"></p>
		<p> You also <em>created</em> variables <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/plural-hat-block-and-first-line-only.png" width="200" alt="plural-hat-block-and-first-line-only"> as inputs to blocks that you made.</p>

        	<div class="sidenote"> A script variable  exists only while the script is running. </div>  
            Sometimes you will need <em>extra</em> variables to store information temporarily while your script is running. The <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/scriptvar.png" alt="script variables" /> block lets you do that.
        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">

                	Watch the video (or read the  instructions that follow it) to see how to create, name, and set the value of a script variable.

                    <ol> 
                        <li>To create the variable, use <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/scriptvar.png" alt="script variables" /> (in the variables tab, of course).</li>
                        <li>To name the variable, click on the orange <em><code>a</code></em> and type the name you want.</li>
                        <li>
                        	To set your variable's value, use 
                        	<img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/set.png" alt="set" />. The down-arrow lets you select the variable you want (in this example, there's only one variable to choose).
                        </li>
                        <li>Then set its value. </li>

                    This script draws polygons with a random number of sides.

                    <strong>Challenge:</strong> Modify the script so that it also picks a <em>size</em> randomly, from 30 through 60 using <em>only multiples of 10</em>.
                    <div class="endnote">There are two ways to create a second script variable.  You could use another <code>script variables</code> block

                <li>
                    <strong>Analyzing and debugging:</strong> Instead of setting a script variable, this script just uses the <code>pick random</code> block in the two places that need the random number. Before you build and run this script, try to figure out what is likely to go wrong.

        	You will sometimes find it useful to compute some expression using the <em>current</em> value of a variable and then set the variable's value to the result. Here is one way that might look in <span class="snap">snap</span>.<br />

					This script leads up to a more useful example. <br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/power--set-result-to-1-repeat-2-(set-result-to-result-times-5)-say-result.png" alt="power--set-result-to-1-repeat-2-(set-result-to-result-times-5)-say-result">
					<ol> 
						<li> Build it, try it, and figure out how it does what it does. </li>
                        <li> Change the <code> times 5</code> to <code> times 3</code> and <em>predict</em> what it will do.</li>
                        <li> Then change the <code> repeat 2</code> to <code> repeat 3</code>. </li>
                        <li> 
                            Build a <strong>reporter</strong> block named <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/raise-base-to-the-power-of-exponent.png" alt="raise-base-to-the-power-of-exponent">.<br />
                            The script you created should help. Put the variables <code>(base)</code> and <code>(exponent)</code> in the right places inside that script.<br />
                            Your block should work like this:<br />
                            <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/raise(2)-to-the-power(3)(with-result).png" alt="raise 2 to the power 3 (result = 8)">
                            <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/raise(2)-to-the-power(5)(with-result).png" alt="raise 2 to the power 5 (result = 32)">
                            <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/raise(3)-to-the-power(4)(with-result).png" alt="raise 3 to the power 4 (result = 81)">

                            Make sure it also works for this case: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/raise(5)-to-the-power(0)(with-result).png" alt="raise 5 to the power 0 (result = 1)"><br />
                            Check (as always!) to make sure it works as you expect.
                        </li>

				<li>Here is another example.

                    <ol> 
                        <li> Build it, try it, and figure out <em>how</em> it does what it does. </li>
                        <li> Change the code so that it puts in hyphens (-) where the vowels used to be.</li>
                        <li> 
                            Change the code so that it <em>counts</em> the vowels, <em>counts</em> all the letters (not including spaces), and ends with <br />
                            <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/say-(vowels)-for-2-secs-say(total-letters)-for-2-secs-say((join-words-(this-passage-is)(vowels-divided-by-total-letters)-percent-vowels.png" alt="say-(vowels)-for-2-secs-say(total-letters)-for-2-secs-say((join-words-(this-passage-is)(vowels-divided-by-total-letters)-percent-vowels"><br />
                            If you like, compare the results you get from similar length sentences in two different languages. You may get very interesting results.
