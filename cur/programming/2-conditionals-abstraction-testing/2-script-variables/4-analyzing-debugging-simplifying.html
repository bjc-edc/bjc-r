                	<strong>GitHub Feedback:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is a typo in 3.b.</li>
                        <li>The block specs should be written to show that there is a numeric input in the function. (Students might not know how to set input types in Snap! yet, but we should always show them the correct way.)</li>
                        <li>3 is a jump. to go from 3 conditionals down to 0. The first time students see this, many likely won't have any idea or hint what to do. The "not" case is also particularly tricky for the first time seeing this simplification.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Additionally, while this should be in the curriculum, we should have an explanation of why a case of simplification like this is important. It's about understanding how code works and what functions can return. Many students need time and/or a discussion before they appreciate this case. Otherwise, that's just ignore it.

                <li><strong>More GitHub Feedback:</strong> make the scripts that we're supposed to click on actually clickable</li>
				<li><strong>GitHub Feedback:</strong> the pictures do not open new windows when clicked as the text box says</li>
                <li><strong>Even more GH feedback:</strong> Items did not link to anywhere, using chrome?<br />Click on any of the pictures to go to a Snap file containing the code.</li>

		<p>Here are two buggy versions written by other programmers. Imagine you are helping these programmers debug their code. Show exactly where, in <em>their</em> code, a small fix (or two) will make it work correctly and be ready to <em>explain</em> why their code didn't work.</p>

        		<li>It is useful to have a <code>max</code> block <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/max.png"> that takes two numbers as input and  tells which is bigger (the maximum). Four versions of <code>max</code> are shown below, two that <em>report</em> the max value, and two commands that <em>say</em> the max value. One of them doesn't work quite right. .
