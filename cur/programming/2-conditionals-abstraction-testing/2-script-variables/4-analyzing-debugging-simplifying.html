                	<strong>GitHub Feedback:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is a typo in 3.b.</li>
                        <li>The block specs should be written to show that there is a numeric input in the function. (Students might not know how to set input types in Snap! yet, but we should always show them the correct way.)</li>
                        <li>3 is a jump. to go from 3 conditionals down to 0. The first time students see this, many likely won't have any idea or hint what to do. The "not" case is also particularly tricky for the first time seeing this simplification.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Additionally, while this should be in the curriculum, we should have an explanation of why a case of simplification like this is important. It's about understanding how code works and what functions can return. Many students need time and/or a discussion before they appreciate this case. Otherwise, that's just ignore it.

                <li><strong>More GitHub Feedback:</strong> make the scripts that we're supposed to click on actually clickable</li>
				<li><strong>GitHub Feedback:</strong> the pictures do not open new windows when clicked as the text box says</li>
                <li><strong>Even more GH feedback:</strong> Items did not link to anywhere, using chrome?<br />Click on any of the pictures to go to a Snap file containing the code.</li>

		<p>Here are two buggy versions. Imagine helping these programmers debug their code. You are not trying to rewrite from scratch, the way you did before, but to find the spots in their code where a small fix (or two) will make it work correctly. You also need to <em>explain</em> what caused the bug in their code.</p>
