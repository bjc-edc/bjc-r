                <li><strong>Mondrian—an art project:</strong> The Dutch artist Piet Mondrian is possibly best known for his artwork using brightly colored rectangles.
                  <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Tableau-I-Piet-Mondrian.png" width="300" alt="Tableau_I,_by_Piet_Mondriaan, from Wikimedia Commons"> &quot;Tableau 1&quot; by Piet Mondrian</p>
                  <p>Mondrian wasn't at all random in his choice of colors and locations, but even some random choices can be interesting. A <span class="snap">snap</span> script can produce designs like these. </p>
                <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Snap-Piet-Mondrian.png" width="260"  alt="Mondrian-like art drawn with Snap"> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Snap-Piet-Mondrian2.png" width="260"  alt="another Mondrian-like design drawn with Snap"></p>
                This algorithm  produced those designs.
<pre class="indent" style="width:450px;">Draw outer frame (400 x 300)
Fill with some color
Repeat many times
    Pick random location
    Pick random height and width for a rectangle that, 
        at that location, won't extend beyond frame
    Draw rectangle boundary in thick black line
    Fill rectangle with random color</pre>
    <p>To keep your code clear, you may want to create separate blocks that specialize in boundary and fill and choosing locations and calculating size.</p>
    <p><span class="snap">snap</span> has no <code>fill with color</code> block.  One way to make such a block is 
<pre class="indent" style="width:450px;">Repeat until height or width is less than 2
	Draw rectangle of specified height and width
	Set height slightly smaller
	Set width slightly smaller</pre>
    </p>
    <p>To get bright colors, use <code>set pen shade to 100</code>, and you get a good collection of colors with

                  <ol>  
                  		<li>Build a program that draws different pictures each time, always using colored rectangles. Use the algorithm suggested above or some idea of your own. <em>Take screen shots of the artworks your program generates and <strong>save the ones that you like</strong> best.</em></li>
                        <li> Mondrian limited his colors and used a lot of white and some black. Experiment with that to see if you get designs you like.</li>
                        <li>Find ways to improve your program. </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Another art idea:</strong> The code <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Set-pen-size-50-move-100-steps.png"  alt="Set-pen-size-50-move-100-steps"> does not do what you might expect, because the "ends of the lines" are rounded. Try it.  Now <code>clear</code> the stage and try <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Set-pen-size-50-move-0.1-steps.png"  alt="Set-pen-size-50-move-0.1-steps">.

                  If you switch to "Flat line ends" for this project, you will probably want to switch back to "round ends" for other drawing projects.

              </li>
                <li><strong>Writing secret code:</strong> Create a block that takes a word as input, changes each letter into the <em>next</em> letter in the alphabet—for example, A becomes B, Y becomes Z...—and reports the result, like this: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/encode-decode(HANDY)-with-result(IBOEZ).png" alt="encode-decode(HANDY)-with-result(IBOEZ)">.
                <p>In order to do this, you will need to be able to change a letter into a number, add 1 to that number, and then change the new number back to a letter. The blocks <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/unicode-of(Y).png" alt="unicode-of(Y)">                and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/unicode(89)as-letter.png"  alt="unicode(89)as-letter"> will help you do that. Experiment with them to see how they work.</p>
                <ol><li>This block encodes by adding 1 to the unicode for each letter. You could, instead, always add 2 or 5 or whatever. Give your block a second variable that allows you to specify what to add to the unicode.</li>
                <li>When you give your <code>encode</code> block the input <code>z</code>, what does it report? If that's not what you would <em>like</em> it to report, change it. </li>
                <li>Make a <code>decode</code> block.</li></ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Linguistic research:</strong> Build a block that can take a piece of text as input and which letter,  <strong>t</strong> or <strong>s</strong>, is used more often in that bit of text. Later, you will be able to generalize this and take a large block of text and figure out the frequency of each letter. <em>Letter frequency differs from language to language. That information has been used as one clue in decoding encrypted messages.</em></li>
    
                <li><strong>A mathematical function: </strong>Create <a name="factorial" class="anchor"></a> a <code>factorial</code> block <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/n-factorial.png" alt="n factorial"> (or <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/n-factorial-symbol.png"  alt="n!">) that takes a positive integer <em>n</em> and reports the product of all whole numbers from 1 through <em>n</em>, in other words 1 &times; 2 &times; 3 &times; ... &times; (<em>n</em> - 1) &times; <em>n</em>. When the  input is 4, the output should be 24 (because 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24). 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Dividing 5! by 4!, the result should be 5 <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/5-factorial-divided-by-4-factorial-with-result(5).png" alt="5-factorial-divided-by-4-factorial-with-result(5)"> because 5 factorial is really just 5 times 4 factorial. Using your block, check each of these computations&mdash;<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/4-factorial-divided-by-3-factorial.png"  alt="4-factorial-divided-by-3-factorial">, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/3-factorial-divided-by-2-factorial.png"  alt="3-factorial-divided-by-2-factorial">, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/2-factorial-divided-by-1-factorial.png"  alt="2-factorial-divided-by-1-factorial"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/1-factorial-divided-by-0-factorial.png"  alt="1-factorial-divided-by-0-factorial">&mdash;to see what it reports. One of these is inconsistent with the others. To fix the problem, we need to <em>define</em> 0! = 1. Edit your <code>n!</code> block to  report 1 if <em>n</em> = 0. Then fully test <code>n!</code> again to make sure it works as it should. </li>
                        <li><strong>Debugging: </strong>Obviously <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/cookie-factorial-bug.png" alt="cookie-factorial-bug"> should not work. Check to see what does happen.  Then edit your block and find a way to use <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/is-n-a-number.png" alt="is n a number"> to check that the input is a number and report some sensible result or message.</li>
                        <li> 
                            <strong>Analyzing code: </strong>In mathematics, factorial is defined only for positive integers and zero, so 3.7! would make no mathematical sense.  But <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/three-point-seven-factorial.png" alt="three-point-seven-factorial"> reports a result.
                            Find out what it reports and analyze what the block does so that you can figure out why <em>that</em> is the result.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Another mathematical function:</strong> Create a block <code>triangular number n</code> that <em>adds</em> all of the whole numbers from 1 through <em>n</em>. 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (<em>n</em> - 1) + <em>n</em>. When its input is 4, your block should report 10 (that is, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4).  Define your block so that <code> triangular number 0</code> reports 0. </li>
                <ol> 
                <li>Create <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/sum from a to b 170 × 27 pixels.png" alt="sum from a to b"> so that <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/sum from 3 to 7 170 × 27 pixels.png" alt="sum from 3 to 7"> reports the sum 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7, and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/sum from -3 to 3.png" alt="sum from -3 to 3"> reports the sum of -3 + -2 + -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3.</li></ol>
                <li> <div class="sidenote">Recall that <code>n mod i</code> will tell you if <em>i</em> is a divisor of <em>n</em>.</div>
                  <strong>Counting divisors: </strong>Create a block that takes a whole number as input and checks  numbers from 1 through that input and counts the ones that evenly divide the input. So, for example, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/number-of-divisors-of-8-with-result(4).png" alt="number of divisors of 8, with result = 4"> because, from 1 through 8, only the numbers 1, 2, 4, and 8 evenly divide 8.  <code>number-of-divisors 10</code> should also report 4 because, of the numbers from 1 through 10, only 1, 2, 5, and 10 are divisors of 10. <strong>Experiment</strong> to find several numbers that have an odd number of divisors.</li>

                <li><strong>Old-fashioned divisibility test—divisibility by 3 or 9: </strong>
                <ul><li>Create a helper reporter <code>digit sum</code> that adds up the digits in a number.  So, for example <code>digit sum 7</code> should report 7, and <code>digit sum 12</code> should report 3, and <code>digit sum 126</code> should report 9 (the sum of 1, 2 and 6).  You may find these blocks useful. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/letter-i-of-number.png" alt="fletter-i-of-number"> <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/for-i=1-to-length-of-number.png" alt="for-i=1-to-length-of-number"></li>
                <li>Then write <code>repeated digit sum</code>, which keeps taking the <code>digit sum</code> until the result is a single digit. For example, the digit sum of 238 is 2+3+8=13, which is more than a single digit. The digit sum of 13 is 1+3=4, which <em>is</em> a single digit. So the repeated digit sum of 238 is 4.</li>
                <li>Write predicates <code>divisible by 3?</code> and <code>divisible by 9?</code>. A number is divisible by 3 if its repeated digit sum is 0, 3, 6, or 9; it's divisible by 9 if its digit sum is 0 or 9.
