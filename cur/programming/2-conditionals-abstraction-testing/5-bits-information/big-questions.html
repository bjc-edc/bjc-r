		<title>Unit 2 Lab 5: Bits and Information</title>
	</head>

	<body>
    	<h2>Getting Started (In process)</h2>
        
        <div>More content to come. Will be based on Blown to Bits chapter 3. See Unit 1 Social Implications Labs for examples of what this page will look like.</div>

<div class="todo">JK: It occurs to me that one thing we lose in not reading the Koans piece is the part about Moore's Law. I still don't think reading the Koans part is worth it, but Moore's Law is probably useful to have that be a part of what gets presented to students. It's referred to in chapter 3. Maybe it can just be a sidenote in this unit?</div>
        
        <p>Notes about BtB Chapter 3</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>What You See Is Not What the Computer Knows (p 73-80) - Includes section on metadata.</li>
            <li>Representations, Reality, and Illusion (p 80-94) - How digital photography works, bits, [note: have students play with a rasterizer], image quality, preserving and losing information, lossless and lossy compression, open source software (maybe skip the part about open source software)</li>
            <li>Hiding Information in Images (p 95-99) - First part is about spam (maybe skip because outdated? It's about spam in the form of images), but second part (97-99) is about steganography, which is interesting!</li>
            <li>The Scary Secrets of Old Disks (p 99-108) - First part is about erasing data from disks, disk organization itself, and then a philosophical bit about data and whether turning everything digital actually reduces its lifespan as technologies become obsolete.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Structure for this lab:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Getting started - playing with a rasterizer?</li>
            <li>Reading Representations, Reality, and Illusion</li>
            <li>An unplugged activity about compression</li>
            <li>Steganography</li>
            <li>[What is the social implications part of this lab? It's about our own beliefs about data - about how long it will last and about how well-protected it is and our ability to control it (delete it and know what does and doesn't exist). So how to bring this to students? Maybe through the idea of control of information? Or "processing is power" idea - so something about the kinds of innovations that are needed and some of the solutions to issues? - Maybe something like think about the limitations of data and representations currently. What innovations are necessry for progress? blah i don't like it]</li>
        </ul>
