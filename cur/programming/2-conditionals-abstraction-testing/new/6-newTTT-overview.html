<p>In this series of Tic Tac Toe projects, you will build three versions of the game, each version making the computer’s involvement in the game more intelligent than the version before:</p>

<strong>Note</strong>: In the last version, even though the computer will be aware of the nuances of the game, it will <strong>not</strong>  be unbeatable.  As an extension activity, you will be encouraged to develop an AI that is unbeatable at Tic Tac Toe.  Such AI, while fun to code, will not be so much fun to play against.</td>

<div class="todo">
<b>Note to the teachers in TG:</b><br>
<p>Based on the feedback we received from previous years, this year we have simplified the Tic Tac Toe project greatly so that all the tedious math is gone and the programmers can focus on the game itself and explore more interesting avenues for the game such as developing an AI player.  In this new version of the Tic Tac Toe, the squares of the Tic Tac Toe board are <strong><em>click-conscious </em></strong> sprites, thus eliminating the need for extensive mathematical computations.  Even though the Tic Tac Toe series of projects are “Teacher’s Choice” (optional), we hope that you and your students will take on the challenge of creating something quite profound like AI at this first course in Computer Science.</p>
