In the “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” series book titled “Hard Luck”, the hilarious main character, Gregg Heffley, decides to use a toy named <em>Magic 8 Ball</em><sup>&reg</sup> to determine what to do about the tough choices he has to make in his life, such as whether to do laundry or clean up his room.  In this project, you will build a program inspired by the <em>Magic 8 Ball</em><sup>&reg</sup> to help you deal with the uncertainties of the future.</div>

<div class="forYouToDo"> 
<ol>
<li>Open the file <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=selimtezel&ProjectName=Magic8Ball_Teacher&hideComtrols" target="_blank">linked here</a> and play with the simulation to get a feel for the toy what you are trying to model.</li> 

<li>The possible answers that the toy gives to a YES/NO question is:<br />

<table class="indent">
<tr><td>&nbsp&nbsp Outlook uncertain&nbsp&nbsp</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp&nbsp Probably yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp&nbsp No way</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp&nbsp It is certain</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp&nbsp Not likely </td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp&nbsp Reply hazy</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp&nbsp May be</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp&nbsp Without a doubt</td></tr>
</table>
<br />
What kind of a data structure would you use in your code to store and retrieve the answer choices?</li>

<li>Open and examine this <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=selimtezel&ProjectName=Magic8Ball_Student" target="_blank"> starter project file</a> where two costumes and a sound file have already been created for you. </li>
<div class="sidenote">If you get stuck, you can look at <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/new/magic8ball-hints.html" target="_blank">this page</a> for some more information.</div>
<li>Write code to model the toy.  Feel free to change any aspects of the project to personalize the project and fit your creative needs.  For example, consider changing the predictions of the ball; use new images for the costumes and may be even add another sound file.</li>

<li>Wikipedia entry for the <em>Magic 8 Ball </em><sup>&reg</sup> mentions that in the original standard version of the toy there were 20 possible answers that the toy could give.  Ten of the possible answers are affirmative (<span style="color:green">green</span>), five are non-committal (<span style="color:blue">blue</span>), and five are negative (<span style="color:red">red</span>).  Change your code to include this greater set of choices.<br />

<li>Trick your friends to think that your model of the <em>Magic 8 Ball </em><sup>&reg</sup> actually knows things and tells the truth.  Create a version of your  model that allows you to select among a certain type of choices when a particular key is <em>secretly</em> pressed.  For example, when the key “1” is pressed only affirmative answers are chosen, when the key “2” is pressed only non-committal answers are chosen, when the key “3” is pressed only negative answers are chosen. Have fun but please be nice!</li>

<li>Fortune telling machines have been popular in our culture for a long time.  Below you see a young Tom Hanks in the movie "Big" with the automated fortune teller Zoltar.  Create your own fortune telling program.<br />
