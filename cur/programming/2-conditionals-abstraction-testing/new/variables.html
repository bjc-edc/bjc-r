            <p>Variables look like reporters, and both do report values, but they are different. 
            <ul>
                <li>Variables always give the <em>same value </em>until the value is changed by the user or programmer.</li>
                <li>
                    Reporters may report different output but always by <em>same</em> <em>process</em> until the process is changed by the programmer.<br />

                </li>
            </ul>
            Reporters always have the same behavior as was coded in at the beginning. Reporter functions it can't be changed by the user but only by a programmer changing the code. Variables, the other hand, can change while the program is running.</p>
