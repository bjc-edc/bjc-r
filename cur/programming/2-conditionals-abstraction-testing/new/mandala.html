<h2>Mandala Design</h2>

In this project you are going to create a geometric pattern called the “Mandala” and explore its variations.<br />

</ol>
</div>

<p>Notice that the drawing of this design can be broken into the following steps:<br />
<ol type="a">
<li> Trace a regular polygon (dodecagon, a 12-sided polygon is pictured in this case)</li>
<li>Store the locations of the vertices of the polygon</li>
<li>Draw segments from each vertex of the polygon to all the other vertices of the polygon.</li>

<li>Start by creating some custom blocks that will help keep track of important information.  The design is based on a set of evenly spaced points (the vertices of the polygon), so there needs to be a way to store the locations of these points.  First create a reporter block that will store in a list the input x and y coordinates of a point.<br />
 <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/point.png" height="100" alt=""/></li>

<li>Then create the reporter blocks that will give access to the x and y coordinates of a given point.<br />
 
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/xPoint.png" height="100" alt=""/><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/yPoint.png"  height="100" alt=""/></li>
 

<li>A lot of segments will be drawn so create a custom block that will draw a segment between any two given points.  The following blocks may help.<br />
<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/HintsForDrawSegment1.png" height="100" alt=""/><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Mandala_img/HintsForDrawSegment2.png"  height="150" alt=""/><br />
 

Note the return to the original point at the end the above code.  This is so because once a diagonal is drawn there is a need to go back to the original vertex in order to draw the remaining diagonals from the vertex.
 
Now everything needed is ready to create the custom block to draw the Mandala.  This block will have two inputs: number of sides and the side length of the polygon used in the Mandala.
 


Create a script variable “pointList” to keep track of the vertex points, initialize it to an empty list and store these points as they are visited during the traversing of the vertices of the regular polygon.
 

 


The following picture may help you remember a turn of 360/n degrees is needed each time while traversing a regular polygon.
 
Now the rest of the code is simple thanks to all the previous steps.  A segment must be drawn from every vertex of the polygon to every vertex of the polygon. 
 

Note that “for each” loop control block is not available by default and to make this control block available you must “Import Tools” from the Snap! file menu.
 

 

Extensions:
(1)  Here is a simple variation on the Mandala created in this project. It shows a more densely knit Mandala.  Change the input of the Mandala custom block to create this in Snap!  Also note that all the concentric circles that appears in this image.  Our Mandala code did not employ any circles, where did these circles come from?  
 


(2) Below are some variations that use the code for the Mandala.  Create these in Snap!

  

(3) Explore some variations of the Mandala based on color such as:

    

(4) In many cultures, Mandala and its variations are celebrated as symbols of “interconnectedness” and “harmony”.  Do some research on Mandalas as created and viewed by different cultures and present your finding to your classmates with a slide show.  Can you create any of these with Snap! ?
 
 


(5) Create your own variations of the Mandala.
