		<h2>Simplifying Tic-Tac-Toe Using Custom Blocks</h2>
    	<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
        	<p>In a <!--Link to this. Where is it? -->previous lab, we used a <code>repeat</code> block to avoid duplicating code.  Similarly, we can use a custom block to avoid duplicating code. Below is some code to draw a tic-tac-toe board.</p>
            <ol><li>Your goal is to create blocks that make this code simpler.</li></ol>

			<p>Some things to remember:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As a first step, break up this drawing task into meaningful sub-tasks.  We suggest doing this working with pen and paper, not while looking at the code!</li>
                <li>Give your new blocks appropriate names.  You want to make it easy to read the code&mdash;at its best, like natural, english sentences&mdash;and understand what it does.</li>
                <li>It may make sense to "split" some blocks up into different custom blocks.  For instance, a single <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-left-180.png" alt="turn left 180 degrees" /> might be better performed as a <img  class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-left-90.png" alt="turn left 90 degrees" /> in one custom block followed by a <img  class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/turn-left-90.png" alt="turn left 90 degrees" /> in another.</li>
            </ul>
