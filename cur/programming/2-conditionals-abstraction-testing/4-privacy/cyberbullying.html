		<div>In this lesson, students have their first class discussion. </div> 

		<h3>Opener</h3>
            <div>Snap Judgment: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bQVpIWKUlYonoGchEU1nfeIGtUek8h3amzg9JbVeASU/edit?usp=sharing"><strong>What is cyberbullying?</strong></a><br>
		Students have likely heard of or even experienced some form of cyberbullying. In <em>Blown to Bits</em>, they will later read a story (page 16) about a student who committed suicide after hurtful comments were aimed at her online. While students generally agree that such tragedies should not occur, they likely differ about their definition of what should be considered cyberbullying. Later, they will engage in a class discussion about possible ways to address cyberbullying. This Snap Judgment is meant to help students clarify for themselves what they mean when they think of "cyberbullying."</div>
            
        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <div><strong>Examine some cases of cyberbullying.</strong> Have students work in small groups for 10-15 minutes researching the issue of cyberbullying online. Guiding question: <em>What are some different forms that cyberbullying can take?</em> For example, they might look at resources like:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://nobullying.com/six-unforgettable-cyber-bullying-cases/">Six Unforgettable CyberBullying Cases (NoBullying.com)</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.violencepreventionworks.org/public/cyber_bullying.page">Cyber Bullying (Violence Prevention Works)</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/Passcode-Voices/2015/0327/How-to-defeat-Internet-bullies">How to defeat Internet bullies (CS Monitor)</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://stopcyberbullying.org/educators/howdoyouhandleacyberbully.html">What methods work with the different kinds of cyberbullies? (stopcyberbullying.org)</a></li>
            </ul> </div>
        <div>Students will <strong>engage in a 25-30 minute discussion.</strong> There are three parts to this discussion:
        <ol>
        	<li>Establish norms for classroom discussion. Ask: <em>What are some important guidelines we should keep as a class?</em> Record these to refer back to in future discussions. Examples may include:
            <ul>
            	<li>We want to hear from as many people as possible. (It may make sense for students to raise their hands when they have something to say, and a facilitator - teacher or student - to write down students' names in order on the board. The students then know what order in which to speak, don't have to keep their hands raised, and the facilitator doesn't have to interrupt to call on people. In this case, it might also help to have a special sign students can make for when they would urgently like to respond to a comment, though this should be used sparingly.)</li>
                <li>We will be discussing sensitive topics; we should treat all contributions with respect. We also know that people's views can change or may not come across as they intended, so we won't jump to conclusions about people's views from their short contributions here.</li>
                <li>We want to keep a spirit of inquiry during discussion; this is not the time to insist on being "right."</li>
                <li>We want to acknowledge each other's contributions and speak to each other, addressing each other by name.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Share some of the findings from the online research. <em>What are some different forms that cyberbullying can take?</em>
            <ul>
            	<li>Students can share stories they found or different definitions of cyberbullying.</li>
                <li>Possible follow-up question: Did anyone find themselves re-thinking their Snap Judgment response from the beginning of class?</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><em>What are some possible ways to effectively address this issue?</em>
            <ul>
            	<li>Students may choose to focus on what they can do individually, what they should think should happen in schools, or what should be done at a societal level.</li>
                <li>Follow-up: What are the challenges to addressing cyberbullying? For example, students may raise first amendment rights, privacy issues regarding their communication, or the ability to assume other identities or operate anonymously online.</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ol>            
            </div>
        
        <h3>Homework</h3>
        <div><strong>Response to cyberbullying discussion</strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j4kFf-22Ta03tvUeLycbqi2_QcfruigXLN8wD922jTo/edit?usp=sharing">Google doc</a><br />
Students have the choice to respond to one of two prompts:
		<ol>
        	<li>How did your understanding of cyberbullying change as a result of today's discussion? Explain your previous understanding, your current understanding, and specific moments of the discussion that helped change that understanding.</li>
            <li>What are the most effective ways for schools to address the issue of cyberbullying? Explain your thinking, raise at least one possible objection someone might raise, and how you would respond to that objection.</li>
            </ol></div>
                    
        <h3>Prepare</h3>
        <div>
        <ul>
        	<li>You may want to think about how your classroom space is set up. If it is possible to move away from computers and even arrange chairs in a circle, this will help establish a discussion space.</li>
        </ul></div>
