		<h2>Keeping Score with Global Variables</h2>

            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will use a <em>global variable</em> to keep score in your Click Alonzo game.</p>

        <div class="comment">Brian, I expect you'll have edits here. --MF</div>
        <p>On the last page, you used <em>script variables</em> to keep track of temporary information (the value of <var>secret number</var>) that was only needed inside one script. To keep score, you need to be able to access the current score from anywhere in your app, and so you'll use a <em>global variable</em>.</p>
        <div class="endnote">It's good programming practice to always use script variables (also known as local variables) <em>unless</em> you need the variable to be accessible to the whole program, in which case you'll use a global variable.</div>

                Variables look like reporters, and both do report values, but they are different:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Variables always give the <em>same value until the value is changed</em> by the user or programmer.<br />

                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/change-score-by-1.png" alt="change (score) by (1)" title="change (score) by (1)" />

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reporters may report different output but always by <em>same process until the process is changed</em> by the programmer.<br />
