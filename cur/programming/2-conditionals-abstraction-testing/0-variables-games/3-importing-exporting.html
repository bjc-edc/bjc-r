            <h4><strong>Dependencies</strong></h4>
            <p>Sometimes when you take a script out of the program where you built it and try to use it somewhere else, something breaks. It could be that the script depends on a custom block that isn't defined in the new program, or it could be (like it is here) that the script depends on a <em>global variable</em> that isn't defined in the new program. </p>

        	<h4><strong>Script Variables vs. Global Variables</strong></h4>

            <div class="comment">I cut this back a lot, but it still feels too long. Any suggestions? --MF</div>
            <p>
            	Whenever possible, you should use script variables (a.k.a. local variables). Here's why:
                <ul>
                    <li>If you import a block that requires global variables into another project, you'll get errors if you don't have those variables defined.</li>
                    <li>It's easier to make sense of the program if only a few global variables are listed at the top of the Variables palette.</li>
                    <li>If you use global variables throughout a large program, you might pick the same name for two variables in different scripts, and one script will change the variable out from under the other script.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            	There are two situations in which you should use a global variable:
                <ol>
                    <li><em>The variable will be used by several scripts across the program.</em> For example, if you are keeping score and different parts of the program change the score.</li>
                    <div class="manualBig">
						<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" alt="Tough Stuff" title="Tough Stuff" />
                    	There are, in fact, two different ways in Snap<em>!</em> to avoid using a global variable for revisiting a value with the same script; look up "block variables" and "object oriented programming with lambda" in the <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/help/SnapManual.pdf" target="_blank">Snap<em>!</em> Reference Manual</a> if you want to know more.(But both of those techniques are a little too complicated for this introductory course.)
	                    <div class="todo">Move to TG? --MF</div>
                    </div>
                    <li><em>The variable will be used by the same script more than once and will need to remember the value between uses.</em> A counter is the classic example; each time you call a block, you want it to change a value by oneâ€”not reset it.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Get in the habit of using script variables most of the time and using a global variable only when a script variable won't work.</strong></p>

        <h3>Personalize the Game</h3>
        <p>Next, you'll give your Number Guessing game a more personal touch by addressing the player by name.</p>

    		<ol start="8">
                <li>Create a new variable, <var>current player</var>, to store the name of the current player. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Should this be a global variable or a script variable?</li>
                <li>
                    Use the <var>current player</var> variable to address the player by name:

                            Edit <code>Number guessing game</code> to use the player's name:

                                <li>Have the computer use the player's name when it says whether the player's guess is correct or not. For example, "Nope, Maria, that's not my number. Try again." or "Wow, Maria, you got it!"</li>
