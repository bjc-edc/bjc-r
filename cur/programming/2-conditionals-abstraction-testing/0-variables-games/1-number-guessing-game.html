		<h2>Developing a Number Guessing Game with Script Variables</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p>
                <strong>In this lab,</strong> you will use two kinds of variables to manage data in your games:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Script variables</em> that are temporary and end when the script ends, and</li>
                    <li><em>Global variables</em> that can be accessed anywhere in the app.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop a number guessing game that uses script variables to keep track of a secret number.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Using a Script Variable</h3>
        <p> 
            You have created variables as inputs to blocks that you made:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Blockswith-Inputs_img/numberofbranches.png" alt="pinwheel code after replacement" title="pinwheel code after replacement" />
        </p>
        <p>
            You have also used variables that the <code>for</code> block gave you:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/squirral-script.png" alt="squiral script" title="squiral script" />
		</p>
        <p> 
			<div class="sidenoteBig"> A script variable exists only while the script is running.</div>  
            Sometimes you will need <em>extra</em> variables to store information temporarily while your script is running. The <code>script variables</code><!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/scriptvar.png" alt="script variables" title="script variables" />--> block lets you do that.
        </p>
		<p>For example, imagine a number-guessing game in which the player tries to guess the computer's secret number. The computer needs to remember the secret number so that is can compare the player's guesses to it, but once the game is over, the secret number does not need to be remembered.</p>
        

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">

                <li>Create a new block called <code>Number guessing game</code>. (You might choose to put it in the Looks palette since there will be a lot of conversation using the <code>say</code> block.)</li>
                <li>
                    Inside this new block, create a script variable called <var>secret number</var> and set it to a random number between 1 and 10.

                                <strong>Set the initial value</strong> of the variable using <code>set</code>. The down-arrow lets you select the variable you want. Set <var>secret number</var> to a random number between 1 and 10.<br />

                        <p>Setting the initial value of a variable is known as <strong>initializing</strong> the variable.</p>

        <h3>Checking the Player's Guess</h3>
		<p>Now the computer should ask the player to guess the secret number again and again until the player gets it right. You will use the <code>repeat until</code> block, which is a <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/6-the-for-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">loop</a> (just like <code>repeat</code>, <code>forever</code>, and <code>for</code>), but it only repeats until a certain <strong>condition</strong> is met. In this case, it should repeat until the player's answer is the secret number.</p>
        
		<div class="takeNote">
        	<p><code>Repeat until</code> is a conditional block just like <code>if</code>. Conditionals control the code based on a <em>condition</em> called a <strong>predicate</strong>. Predicates are hexagonal-shaped reporters that always report a <strong>Boolean value</strong> (that is, they can only report either <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true" title="true" /> or <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false" title="false" />). Predicates help conditionals (such as <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if.png" alt="if block" title="if block" /> or <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat-until.png" alt="repeat until" title="repeat until" />) <em>decide when to do something</em>.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="4">
                <li>Use <code>repeat until</code> to ask the player to guess the secret number until their answer equals the secret number.</li>
        		<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /> 
                <li>After the players guesses the secret number, make the computer congratulate the player.</li>
                <li><strong>Debug.</strong> Take turns playing the game, and fix any problems with the code before moving on.</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="7">
				<div class="sidenoteBig">Use <code>join</code> to merge the text "You guessed it! My secret number was" with the value of the <var>secret number</var> variable.</div>
                <li>When the computer congratulates the player for guessing correctly, have the computer say the number. For example, it might say, "You guessed it! My secret number was 7."</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="8">
            	<li>Use more conditional blocks and predicates to make the computer tell the player whether their guess is too big or too small: "That's too big. Try again." <br /><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> How should these conditionals work and where in the code should they go?</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Debug.</strong> Play your game a few more times, and check that it performs as expected:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The game should ask the player to guess its secret number.</li>
                        <li>The game should say whether the answer was too big or too small or congratulate the player if they guess the number.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>Since script variables only exist while the script is running, the <var>secret number</var> variable will <em>not exist</em> when <code>Number guessing game</code> is not running. When the game is played again, the program will create the variable again and <em>initialize</em> it with a different random number.</p>
		<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />
        <p>Later in the course, you will teach the computer to guess <em>your</em> secret number.</p>
        
        <div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="10">
				<li>Right now, the script always picks a number between 1 and 10.  At the start of the game, ask the player what the maximum number should be, and set a script variable named <var>maximum</var> to that number. Let your program choose a number between 1 and <var>maximum</var>.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeItFurther"><a name="further" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
            <ol type="A">
				<li>Use another script variable to keep track of how many guesses the player makes before getting the right number. When the player guesses the secret number, say how many guesses it took.</li>
                <li>Find a way to vary the language a bit so that your program does not always repeat exactly the same words in the same situation. For example, if a player guesses too high twice in a row, the program could say "That's <em>still</em> too big. Try another number."</li>
            </ol>
