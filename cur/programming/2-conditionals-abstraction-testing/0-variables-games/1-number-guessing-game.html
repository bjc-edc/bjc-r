		<h2>Developing a Number Guessing Game with Script Variables</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p>
                <strong>In this lab,</strong> you will use two kinds of variables to manage data in your games:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Script variables</em> (also known as <em>local</em> variables) that are for use in a single script, and</li>
                    <li><em>Global variables</em> that can be accessed anywhere in the app.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop a number guessing game that uses a script variable to keep track of a secret number.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Using a Script Variable</h3>
        <p> 
            You have created variables as inputs to blocks that you made:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Blockswith-Inputs_img/numberofbranches.png" alt="pinwheel code after replacement" title="pinwheel code after replacement" />
        </p>
        <p>
            You have also used variables that the <code>for</code> block gave you:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/looping/squirral-script.png" alt="squiral script" title="squiral script" />
		</p>
        <p>Both input variables and <code>for</code> variables belong to the script in which they're created; you can't drag one into a different script (or rather, you can, but it won't work). They are kinds of <strong>script variables</strong>.	</p>
    <div class="sidenoteBig"> A script variable usually exists only while the script is running.</div>  
            Sometimes you will need <em>additional</em> script variables to hold information temporarily, while your script is running. The <code>script variables</code><!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/scriptvar.png" alt="script variables" title="script variables" />--> block lets you do that.
        </p>
		<p>For example, imagine a number-guessing game in which the player tries to guess the computer's secret number. The computer needs to remember the secret number so that it can compare the player's guesses to it, but once the game is over, the secret number does not need to be remembered. If you play the game again, you want to get a new secret number.</p>

                    Inside this new block, create a script variable called <var>secret number</var> and set it to a random number between 1 and 10.

        <h3>Checking the Player's Guess</h3>
		<p>The computer should ask the player to guess the secret number again and again until the player gets it right. You will use the <code>repeat until</code> block, which is a <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/6-the-for-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">loop</a> (just like <code>repeat</code>, <code>forever</code>, and <code>for</code>), but it only repeats until a certain <strong>condition</strong> is met. In this case, it should repeat until the player's answer is the secret number.</p>
        
		<div class="takeNote">
        	<div class="vocab"><strong>: Boolean.</strong><br />It's capitalized because it's named after a person, George Boole, who invented the branch of mathematics dealing with Boolean operations.</div>
        	<p><code>Repeat until</code> is a conditional block, like <code>if</code>, as well as being a loop block. Conditionals make choices in a program based on a true-or-false <em>condition</em> called a<strong> Boolean value.</strong> There are only two Boolean values,<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true" title="true" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false" title="false" />. But you don't generally use these values directly in your code; you don't say <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/iftrue.png" height="50" alt="if (true) ...">. Instead, you use a block to ask a yes-or-no question, such as <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/a-gt-7.png" alt="a &gt; 7">. Blocks that report Boolean values are called <strong>predicates</strong>. They are a special shape (hexagonal) so that they fit into the hexagonal input slots of conditional blocks. Predicates help conditionals (such as <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if.png" alt="if block" title="if block" /> or <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat-until.png" alt="repeat until" title="repeat until" />) <em>decide when to do something</em>.</p>
