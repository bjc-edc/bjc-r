    </head>

		<h2>Practice with Complex Booleans</h2>
		<p>Now we're going to write some blocks that utilize predicates like <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>.</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>Write a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/weekend.png" alt="weekend (_)"/> block that reports whether a given day is a weekend. Let's assume that only Saturday and Sunday are part of the weekend.</li>
                <li>Write a <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/weekday.png" alt="weekday (_)"/> block. You could write this with or without your <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/weekend.png" alt="weekend (_)"/>block, but it'll be much easier if you do.</li>
                <li>
                    Here is a block definition. Give it a more descriptive name, then re-write using no <code>if</code> blocks.<br/>
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/cond/mystery.png"/>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
   </body>
