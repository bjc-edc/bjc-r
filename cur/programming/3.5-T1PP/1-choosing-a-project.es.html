            <p>On the one hand, I love the differentiation.</p>
            <p>On the other, I worry that, even with differentiation, the amounts of time required to complete the different projects is radically different.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but teachers need to have the ability to get away from keeping students at the same pace.</p>
            <p>I do not have suggestions at this time.  I'm just a bit concerned that you will hit trouble because of the timing issues.</p>

CRD-2.E:
Develop a program using a development process.

CRD-2.E.1:
A development process can be ordered and intentional, or exploratory in nature.

CRD-2.E.2:
There are multiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program:
•	investigating and reflecting
•	designing
•	prototyping
•	testing

CRD-2.E.3:
A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process.

CRD-2.E.4:
A development process that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole.

CRD-2.F:
Design a program and its user interface.

CRD-2.F.1:
The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements.

CRD-2.F.2:
Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program.

CRD-2.F.3:
Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows:
•	collecting data through surveys
•	user testing
•	interviews
•	direct observations

CRD-2.F.4:
Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide.

CRD-2.F.5:
A program’s specification defines the requirements for the program.

CRD-2.F.6:
In a development process, the design phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification.

CRD-2.F.7:
The design phase of a program may include:
•	brainstorming
•	planning and storyboarding
•	organizing the program into modules and functional components
•	creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface
•	development of a testing strategy for the program

CRD-2.G:
Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation.

CRD-2.G.1:
Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed.

CRD-2.G.2:
Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people and do not affect how a program runs.

CRD-2.G.3:
Programmers should document a program throughout its development.

CRD-2.G.4:
Program documentation helps in developing and maintaining correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments.

CRD-2.G.5:
Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be required.

CRD-2.H:
Acknowledge code segments used from other sources.

CRD-2.H.1:
It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source.

CRD-2.H.2:
Acknowledgment of code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgment should include the origin or original author’s name.

CRD-2.I:
For errors in an algorithm or program:
a. Identify the error.
b. Correct the error.

CRD-2.I.1:
A logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly.

CRD-2.I.2:
A syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of the programming language are not followed.

CRD-2.I.3:
A run-time error is a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program. Programming languages define their own run-time errors.

CRD-2.I.4:
An overflow error is an error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside of the defined range of values.

CRD-2.I.5:
The following are effective ways to find and correct errors:
•	test cases
•	hand tracing
•	visualizations
•	debuggers
•	adding extra output statement(s)

CRD-2.J:
Identify inputs and corresponding expected outputs or behaviors that can be used to check the correctness of an algorithm or program.

CRD-2.J.1:
In the development process, testing uses defined inputs to ensure that an algorithm or program is producing the expected outcomes. Programmers use the results from testing to revise their algorithms or programs.

CRD-2.J.2:
Defined inputs used to test a program should demonstrate the different expected outcomes that are at or just beyond the extremes (minimum and maximum) of input data.

CRD-2.J.3:
Program requirements are needed to identify appropriate defined inputs for testing.

        <p>You now have a chance to develop a project of your own. You may choose one of the ideas suggested below, or  design something completely different. Doing your own project will  help to prepare you for the <a href="http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-performance-assessment.pdf" target="_blank">Advanced Placement Create Task</a> later in the year.</p>

    <div class="endnote"> <p>
            The  AP Create Task, later this year, requires you to go through each of the following steps with a partner and <em>also</em> individually. For now, you will work only with a partner, and you will not do the video.
<ul>

	            <li>Choosing and developing a Snap<em>!</em> project to develop as a team</li>
                <li>Submitting a PDF of your code and a video of your project</li>
                <li>Writing a team reflection on your programming project</li>

</ul>
        </p></div>

        <!--<p>
            You will do part of the project <strong>by yourself</strong>:
			<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/work-by-yourself.es.png" alt="Work by Yourself" title="Work by Yourself" />
            <ul>
	            <li>Creating a second Snap<em>!</em> project <em>by yourself</em> <strong>or</strong> developing a new feature for your team program by yourself</li>
                <li>Submitting a PDF of your code and a video of your project</li>
                <li>Writing an <em>individual</em> reflection on both programming projects</li>
            </ul>
        </p>-->

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first"><a name="projects" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>
           Review the following ideas for projects, and <em><strong>select one</strong></em> to build. Or  design one of your own ideas!
            <ol>
                        <li>Improve or extend a project you have already started.
                        	<ol type="i">
                            	<li>You built <strong>ClickAlonzo</strong> in Unit 1. You can now keep track of players' scores, or add another sprite that chases you and you have to avoid or.... Invent your own ideas.</li>
                                <li>You built a <strong>Contacts app</strong>. You can invent "search" or some other feature. And you can make it look better.</li>
                                <li>You built <strong>sprite chase</strong> project. Lots of projects can come from that. Here's one: imagine that some sprites are wolves and some are sheep. Wolves need to eat to live, so they chase sheep and eat them if they catch them. But if they eat <em>all</em> the sheep, the wolves have nothing to eat and die, too. Sheep reproduce if they live long enough.  Build a model that "lives" for a while.</li>
                            	<li>You built <strong>sentence generators</strong>. You might make more interesting sentences, or parts of conversations, or even poems, or choose another language.</li>
                            	<li>You built <strong>art and music generators</strong>. You might research what geometric ideas artists have used and model some of their art. Or you might find a way to write a melody as a list of positions on a scale and them <code>map</code> the melody to various scales. </li>
                            	<li>You began a <strong>board game</strong> in Unit 2, and extended it to let two people play <strong>Tic Tac Toe</strong>. You might get the <em>computer</em> to play one side of the Tic Tac Toe game. Here are some things the computer might want to "think" about on its turn: Can I <em>win</em> on this move? If not, must I <em>block</em> the other player on this move?</li>
                                <li>There are zillions of <strong>other games</strong> on a Tic-Tac-Toe-like board. Here's one: On a six-by-six board, get four in a row. Here's another, originally invented by a nine-year-old girl named Rani: On a five-by-five board, on your turn, play in any space that <em>doesn't touch (even at a corner)</em> a space that has already been played in. Last person who can move is the winner. Tough game to play well!</li>
                                <li>The<strong> number guessing</strong> game is too easy. What twenty-questions-like game can you invent? </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Invent something new:
                        	<ol type="i">
                            	<li>Use sprites as the buttons on a <strong>calculator</strong>, and make your calculator work.</li>
                                <li>Invent an <strong>algebra calculator</strong>, like multiply two binomials.  You might represent -2x + 1 as the list <code>{-2; 1}</code>. It could help with homework!</li>
                                <li>Or <strong>come up with any idea of your own</strong>!</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Projects that others have done:
