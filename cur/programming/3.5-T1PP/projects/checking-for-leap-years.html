		<h2>Checking for Leap Years</h2>
        <div class="todo">
        	<ul>
                <li>MF: Again, I'm wanting us to be mindful of mathematical level here. Divisibility might not be a comfortable topic for our NYC students... And there are a lot of different constraints with this leap year issue.</li>
                <li>MF: The last question here ("Which script is the most beatuiful?") is a tricky one. In a CS10 class, students might be comfortable with the subjectivity of this question based on their classroom culture, but I would think most high school math or computer sceince students are going to be expecting questions to have a "right answer" and if we want to ask questions like this, we might need to be careful to help teachers build a culture that is more comfortable with questions like this.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Some years in our (Gregorian) calendar are "leap years." In a leap year, February has a 29th day and the year overall has 366. Leap years let the calendar adjust for the fact that  it takes the earth takes slightly <em>over</em> 365 days to revolve around the sun. The fact that it is approximately 365.25 days should mean that leap year should come every fourth year.</p>
        <p>But, things are a bit more complicated than that because one revolution around the sun is <em>almost</em> but not quite 365.25 years, so leap years come slightly less often than once every four years.  To figure out if a year (say, 1999) is a leap year, you need to test whether it is divisible evenly &mdash; that is, if there is no remainder after the division &mdash; by three different values.</p>
        <div class="takeNote">
            <p>A calendar year is a leap year if</p>
            <ul>
                <li>it can be divided evenly by 4,</li>
                <li><em>unless</em> it can also be divided evenly by 100, in which case it is <em>not</em> a leap year,</li>
                <li>except if it is <em>also</em> divisible by 400, in which case it <em>is</em> a leap year.</li>
            </ul>
           <p>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#Gregorian_calendar" target="_blank">We aren't making this up.</a>)</p>
        </div>
        <p>So, the year 2000 was a leap year (divisible evenly by 400, 100, and 4),1900 was not (divisible evenly by 100 and 4 but not by 400), 2012 was (divisible evenly by 4 but neither 100 nor 400), and 2015 wasn't (not divisible by 4).</p>

                	Consider the block sets below: they all say "leap year" if the <code>year</code> variable is a leap year and "normal year" otherwise.  That is, they all work correctly, without any bugs. (The scripts are available in <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/conditionals/dates/is-leap-year.xml">this <span class="snap">snap</span> program</a>).
