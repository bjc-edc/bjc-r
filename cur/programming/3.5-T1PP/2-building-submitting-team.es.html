                Work with your partner to develop your program.
                <p>When you have a working project:</p>
            <ol>
                   
    <li>Export a summary of your project and save that page as a pdf: <img src="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3.5-T1PP/Export-Summary.es.png" width="157" height="261" alt="export-summary.es.png"></li>
    <li>Create a document describing your project... 
    	<ol type="i">
        <li>Describe the purpose of your program and the language that you used (Snap<em>!</em>, of course) to write it. If necessary, say how to use it. (100 words or less)</li> 
        <li>Describe how your project uses <em>abstraction</em>: (100 words or less)

                    <ul>
                        <li>Include an image of part of your program that uses abstraction.</li>
                        <li>Describe how this part of your program uses abstraction.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
    
   		 <li>Describe how your project uses a complex <em>algorithm</em>: (100 words or less)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Include an image of the most complicated algorithm in your program.</li>
                        <li>Describe what that algorithm does.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li></ul>

                <!-- <li>
					Create a video (two options below) of your program running. It should be <em>less than 1 minute</em> and include a description of the program either as text or a voice recording. Send the video to your teacher.
                    <ul>
                    	<li>You can create your video by using a screen-recording program like QuickTime Player (on a Mac) or by downloading a program that your teacher recommends (on a PC).</li>
                        <li>Or you can use a phone, tablet, or video camera to record your program in action.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>  -->
            </ol>
