This is an advance release of one unit of the 2017-2018 version of the curriculum. (You can continue to use the prior version of Unit 4 at the Jan 2017 link at the bottom of this page.)</li>

                <li>Update on 11/5/16: additions to Teacher Guide for Unit 2 Lab 6 and Unit 3 including the Lab Goals, assessment ideas, mathematical notes, and solutions; added <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/resources/video-list-scratch.html">Alternate Links</a> page for edX BJC Videos; fixed buggy <code>proxied HTTP</code> block in Unit 4 Lab 1.</li>

                <li>Update on 10/8/16: addition of BJCx videos to Teacher Guide Lab pages and complete list on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/resources/tg-resources.html?course=bjc4nyc_teacher.html&novideo&noassignment">Teacher Resources</a> page, changes to Unit 2 Lab 2 Page 2 problems 1 and 2 (to make them more doable), other more minor changes to Unit 2 student pages, and significant changes to the Unit 2 Teacher Guide including the addition of Lab Goals, assessment ideas, mathematical notes, and solutions.</li>
                <li>Update on 9/19/16: very few changes to the student materials (mostly typos), but significant changes to the Unit 1 Teacher Guide, namely: the addition of "Goals for the Lab" designed to help teachers target the essential skills learned on each student page, ideas for assessment, mathematical notes where we thought they would be helpful, and official solutions.</li>

        <p>Please note that some changes may continue to take place in "relatively fixed" units. We developers will eschew major changes on units with which teachers may be currently planning or teaching. We will develop those materials at other times of the year.</p>-->
        
        <p>The 2016-2017 version of the site will remain relatively static throughout the school year. There may be minor changes (such as correcting typos, editing images, or teacher guide updates) but no major unit restructuring. For example in August, we marked a number of labs and pages as optional, but they have not been removed from the curriculum so as to maintain consistency for teachers familiar with these labs.</p>
        <p>For 2017-2018, the completed version of the curriculum will be made available later in the summer of 2017.</p>
        <p>Note: If you are looking for old content, there are three older versions of this curriculum available: <a href="http://bjc.edc.org/Sept2015/bjc-r">Sept 2015</a> (<a href="http://bjc.edc.org/Sept2015/bjc-r/teacher">Sept 2015 TG</a>), <a href="http://bjc.edc.org/Aug2016/bjc-r">Aug 2016</a> (<a href="http://bjc.edc.org/Aug2016/bjc-r/teacher">Aug 2016 TG</a>), <a href="http://bjc.edc.org/Jan2017/bjc-r">Jan 2017</a> (<a href="http://bjc.edc.org/Jan2017/bjc-r/teacher">Jan 2017 TG</a>), and <a href="http://bjc.edc.org/June2017/bjc-r">June 2017</a> (<a href="http://bjc.edc.org/June2017/bjc-r/teacher">June 2017 TG</a>).</p>
