One of the most significant of the doors that has been recently opened is the ability to <span style="font-style: italic;">simulate</span> natural events to predict what effects will arise from a particular situation. While pre-simulation science depended on using theories or direct experiments, we are also now able to use theory and mathematical laws to predict things like planet-wide climate change that could not be determined through the use of normal experiments.<br><br>The scientific community has already incorporated simulation down to the core of some of its projects. From the National Science Foundation's Simulation-Based Engineering Science Report (2006):<br><br><p style="margin: 0pt auto; text-align: center; width: 70%;">"[Scientific simulation] is a discipline indispensable to the nation's continued leadership in science and engineering. It is central to advances in biomedicine, nanomanufacturing, homeland security, microelectronics, energy and environmental sciences, advanced materials, and product development. There is ample evidence that developments in these new disciplines could significantly impact virtually every aspect of human experience." </p><br>Many simulations have a degree of randomness to them to accommodate for the unpredictability of the situations they're trying to represent. Because of this randomness, we can't trust that a single run of a simulation will act as a gateway to the future; instead, we run the simulation many times and determine what the average outcome is. According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">law of large numbers</a>, if the model that is being simulated is accurate then more trial runs will result in more accurate results. The availability of massive supercomputers today makes it possible to run large simulations many times in a relatively short period of time.<br><h2>Recent Examples of Simulation</h2>Simulations already play a pivotal role on many of the frontiers in scientific research today. We have included six major applications of simulations in today's world.  Read over any of the examples that seem interesting, in order to get a better feel for what types of problems are typically addressed with techniques like simulation.<br></body></html>
