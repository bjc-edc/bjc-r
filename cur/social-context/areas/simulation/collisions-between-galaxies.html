Mixing chemicals can start fires. Testing big weapons can put the lives of many people at risk. But what about colliding two galaxies together? That's taking it to a whole different level, not to mention how difficult this sort of experiment would be to set up given that we have no control over these sorts of things.<br><br>Nevertheless, our galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy, is expected to collide with the "nearby" Andromeda galaxy in about 3 billion years. What will this mean for both galaxies and anything that happens to inhabit them at that time? Is there any way that studying such a collision could improve our understanding of physics? The video focuses on the Milky Way galaxy as the Andromeda galaxy makes two passes through it: the first is a glancing blow while the second results in a merging of the two into a single galaxy.<br></body></html>
