<div style="float: left; margin: 5px;"><img border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/lss-chdm.jpg" alt="Universe matter distribution" title="Universe matter distribution" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/lss_chdm.jpg"></div>The world of physics experienced a paradigm shift when Einstein developed his general theory of relativity (all of that E = mc<sup>2</sup> stuff). Einstein, as well as other scientists like James Clerk Maxwell, have led the world of physics into the realization that many of the things that we see can be explained with a very small set of physical rules. In order to test these theories, physics has taken a huge move into the area outside of Earth's atmosphere -- our solar system, galaxy, and universe.<br><br>Many people (non-scientists included) are intensely curious about the universe. Where did it all come from? How is it possible for life to exist on Earth? Why are there so many stars in the sky? Why aren't there <span style="font-style: italic;">more</span> stars in the sky? These are questions that are not only interesting on a personal level, but also a scientific level to many physicists. Until very recently, it was incredibly difficult to fathom any sort of evidence-based answers to them.<br><br>Recent improvements in scientific instrumentation, such as satellites and the Hubble Space Telescope, have allowed us to get a much firmer understanding of what our universe is and where it may have come from. However, many of these ideas predict that strange (and possibly invisible, to make matters worse) types of particles and matter must exist in the universe in order for it to have formed in the way it did.<br><br>That sounds like a serious problem for those who are trying to observe it, but its a perfect application for simulations! Not only are astrophysicists able to predict that it exists, but they can predict about how much of it there should be. Once again, by combining the evidence we've gained from observation with the best physical theories that we have, we are able to simulate what our universe would look like with and without the invisible matter. The simulation above is an image generated by Columbia University showing a possible structure for the universe given that a particular type of this invisible matter actually exists.<br></body></html>
