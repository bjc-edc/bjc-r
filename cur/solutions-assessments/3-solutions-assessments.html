                                Exercise 1: Many answers are possible.  Besides the left-wall algorithm described later on the page, a likely student response would be something like this:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>From any position there are four possible ways to move: forward, backward, to my left, or to my right.  List the ways that are not blocked by a wall.</li>
                                    <li>If this isn't the first move, delete any move that takes us to a position we've been in before.</li>
                                    <li>For each remaining possible move, make a clone and start it going in the appropriate direction.</li>
                                    <li>When a clone moves, have it mark the square it's in as having been visited, for the sake of rule (b).</li>
                                    <li><code>Hide</code> the original sprite.</li>
                                    <li>If there is no possible move for this sprite, delete it.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Exercise 2: The steps of the algorithm, from (a) to (f), are done in sequence.  Steps (b) and (f) involve selection.  The repetition is harder to find because it works by cloning rather than explicit looping, so this algorithm might not be a good choice for the AP Create Task.  But technically, cloning should count as repetition, which happens in the language's scheduler ("give each sprite with work to do a chance to run" cycles through a list of active sprites, like a FOR EACH ITEM).</li>
                            <li>Exercises 3 &amp; 5:  This exercise is a little sneaky, because the optimal move at the beginning is to back up a step and then move to the east.  Still, the algorithm above works, because a backward move is allowed if it doesn't take us to an already-visited square.  So does the left-wall algorithm, although it's important to note that left-wall <em>doesn't</em> say to give up if a square has been seen before.  In this maze, the sprite will visit almost every square in the left half of the maze, then visit it again retracing its steps.  Eventually it'll return to its starting position, but facing a different direction, so its left wall will take it into the right half of the maze and a quick solution.</li>
                            <li>
                                Exercise A (Take It Further): The simplest example is to have an "island" at the entrance to the maze...
<pre>XXXXXXXXXXXXX         XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
X                                    X
X    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX                 X
X    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX                 X
X                                    X
XXXX        ^                  XXXXXXX</pre>
                                <p>At the entrance (^) there's no left wall, so we move forward, hit an obstacle, turn right, and then forever loop going counterclockwise around the island.</p>

                            <li>Exercise 1: At one time, some people thought that the goal of robotics should be to make a humanoid robot, because such a robot could use all the tools, vehicles, and so on that are designed for human beings.  But, so far at least, it has been more effective to design the robot into the tool.  For example, industrial automation uses robot arms that aren't attached to bodies.  So far, the main use of artificial human bodies, not really robots because they don't <em>do</em> anything, has been as "victims" of simulated violence or as sex objects.  They've also been used as simulated passengers by drivers who want to use carpool lanes without really carpooling, but it hasn't been very successful, because they don't really look human.  The social implications would be more serious if technology ever reaches the point of building robots that look like <em>specific</em> human beings, for example to use as stunt doubles in making movies.  This would introduce the possibility of a real-time "deepfake."</li>
                            <li>
                                Exercise 2: 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>There has been a huge flurry of writing by ethicists about this question of whose life an AI vehicle should end, if there's a choice of two bad outcomes.  The question feels bizarre, and it <em>is</em> bizarre, because ethical behavior would be to drive in a way that doesn't allow such dilemmas to arise, e.g., not driving faster than your headlights can see.  By the time you have a choice of whom to save and whom to kill, it's too late for ethics.</li>
                                    <li>The question of a fair distribution of the benefits of robots is like the same question for any technology.  One solution would be to reduce the work week without reducing pay: 30 hours work for 40 hours pay.  Another would be, as was done in some places during the COVID-19 closing of most workplaces, just to keep paying workers displaced by robots, as a matter of social justice.</li>
                                    <li>We are very, very far from developing robots with a human being's sense of self and moral agency.  So a robot can't really "commit a crime" in the same way that a person can.  If the programmer of a robot deliberately programs it to commit crimes, it's the programmer who commits the crime.  If a robot behaves destructively because of an error in its programming, then it's not a crime at all, but an industrial accident, for which the programmer is civilly liable for the cost of the damage, but is not criminally liable, unless the programming was done carelessly by the standard of the craft, in which case it depends on the skill of the lawyers.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Exercise 3: Most AI systems today are not programmed in the traditional sense of developing an algorithm and coding it, as students do in this course.  Rather, AI developers use a general program that simulates a neural net, and then <em>train</em> that network using examples of desired and undesired cases.  Research has shown that when those cases include people (for example, sick and healthy people, to teach the AI to diagnose illness) and all the examples are white people, the AI doesn't work for people of color.  The actual example that made the news was a self-driving car that failed to recognize black pedestrians as obstacles to be avoided.  That problem was solved by retraining the AI with a diverse set of pedestrians.  Since then, it has been accepted as an ethical obligation for AI developers to think about people of color (and women, and people in wheelchairs, and very young or very old people) in the training set they use.  Really, while it's super important, this should be an easy problem to solve now that we've become aware of it.

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Jobs that didn't exist at all 25 years ago include social media influencers, data scientists (although to some extent this is just a renaming of statisticians), reality TV stars, and the like.  But 60 years ago, at the beginning of the personal computer revolution, was a burst of new jobs that still just barely existed 25 years ago and are now very significant, e.g., movie digital effects technicians.  A different question that could be asked, though, is "what jobs are showing the most growth?" and the answers are personal services, including home health care for boomers, and (as everyone knows) fast food workers.  There have also been shifts in the nature of work that amount to a new category even though the work itself has been around forever, such as the shift from employees of taxi companies to self-employed Uber drivers.</li>
                                    <li>Many repair jobs, e.g., watch repair, and to a large extent automobile repair, have lost ground because it's cheaper to replace the entire thing, in the case of watches, or a major subassembly such as the transmission, in the case of cars.  Manufacturing jobs are disappearing quickly, both to automation and to China.  Teaching jobs are in decline, a victim of school budgets.</li>
                                    <li>The job situation in 25 years depends on the <em>general</em> situation in 25 years.  For example, there could be a greatly increased need for rescue workers if climate change leads to many more extreme weather events. On the other hand, US job loss could reach the point at which not having a job and having a government-provided, livable minimum income becomes politically acceptable.  New Deal-style infrastructure jobs (from fixing the potholes to painting murals) may appear.  Perhaps there will be a profession of privacy advocates who fight Facebook on your behalf.</li>
                                    <li>"Never" is a long time.  It's definitely possible that in some future time the question of consciousness&mdash;the property we have that computers, so far, don't&mdash;becomes fully understood, so that computers can do anything.  But if present trends continue, what we'll see is probably that computers will continue to do a mediocre job of things like language translation, much better than nothing, but comically bad compared to human beings.</li>
                                    <li>Of course this is an opinion question without a correct answer.  But the kind of work that should be withheld from computers includes jobs in which they do very well in the average, but the results are terrible for some individual person when they do badly, such as the current experiments in making parole decisions by computer.</li>

                            <li>Exercise 1: The answers are really the same for all the bullet points in this question:  They're all good from the employer's point of view, and all bad from the worker's point of view.  Even the last one, using video surveillance to reduce theft, which seems unobjectionable at first glance, has the problem that the video cameras won't <em>only</em> pick up theft.  They'll also see a worker taking a short break, overhear the worker complaining about the boss, and record minor embarrassing behaviors like itching scratches in sensitive areas.  So, as usual in social implications questions, a better way to think about it is (1) what are the benefits; (2) what are the harms; <em>and (3) how could we change the design to keep the benefits and avoid the harms?</em>  So, in the case of video surveillance, perhaps a system could guarantee that the recordings aren't visible by the boss, and are deleted after 24 hours unless a theft is detected, in which case the police can see the recordings but the boss still can't.  In the case of email, the current position of the law is that anything you do using your boss's computer is their property, but occasional personal email while at work is something everyone does, and the law <em>should</em> find a way to preserve the worker's privacy.  As a start, perhaps the employer should see a log of names of people outside the company with whom a worker corresponds, but not the content of the messages.  Even that's problematic, but would be better.  As for games, if I had a job answering phone calls from customers, I'd play games on the side, too.</li>
                            <li>Exercise 2: (Second bullet group.)  The answers are pretty clear, namely, false, it depends, true, and true.  One question not asked here is about the benefits to customers, i.e., cheap rides.  (The downside for both customers and drivers is the occasional assault by the other party.)  For those of us who were red diaper babies, this is no different from the century-old question about scab labor vs. union labor; the former makes for cheaper products, but not cheaper enough to make up for the loss of income.</li>

                                <p>Exercise 1:  This page was written before COVID-19, which has changed everything, perhaps permanently.  Even before the pandemic, there was a sharp division between intellectual workers, who can work anywhere, and service workers, who have to work on location.  Since the pandemic, the division is not only financial but in workers' ability to protect themselves from illness.  For <em>most</em> workers, the issues on this page don't arise.  For intellectual workers, employers used to prefer on-site work because of the ease of conducting both formal and spur-of-the-moment meetings.  (This is the explanation for the provision on site of everything from Nerf balls to laundry facilities.)  But now there has been a forced movement of intellectual workers to their homes, and employers are discovering that it's not so terrible.  Workers are more alert if they can skip the hours every day wasted in commuting, and Zoom, one of the few companies whose stock rose during the massive sell-offs in the first days of the pandemic, isn't so bad for customers who pay for premium service.  So it's likely that even after a return to the workplace is possible, many workers will choose to remain at home with their employer's blessing.</p>

                                    <li>Telemedicine is way better than nothing, although its big weakness is that a doctor may be less likely to notice something about the patient's condition other than the problem that brought the patient to the doctor.</li>
                                    <li>Third world agriculture has indeed been changed dramatically by cell phones, but this really has nothing to do with remote work.</li>
                                    <li>Outsourcing is always bad for US workers.  It saves money for already-rich companies at a huge human cost.  At the end of the page is a discussion of individuals outsourcing their lives; there has been at least one case in which a computer programmer hired programmers in India for very low wages to perform his entire job!
