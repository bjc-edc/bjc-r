                                Exercise 1: Many answers are possible.  Besides the left-wall algorithm described later on the page, a likely student response would be something like this:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>From any position there are four possible ways to move: forward, backward, to my left, or to my right.  List the ways that are not blocked by a wall.</li>
                                    <li>If this isn't the first move, delete any move that takes us to a position we've been in before.</li>
                                    <li>For each remaining possible move, make a clone and start it going in the appropriate direction.</li>
                                    <li>When a clone moves, have it mark the square it's in as having been visited, for the sake of rule (b).</li>
                                    <li><code>Hide</code> the original sprite.</li>
                                    <li>If there is no possible move for this sprite, delete it.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Exercise 2: The steps of the algorithm, from (a) to (f), are done in sequence.  Steps (b) and (f) involve selection.  The repetition is harder to find because it works by cloning rather than explicit looping, so this algorithm might not be a good choice for the AP Create Task.  But technically, cloning should count as repetition, which happens in the language's scheduler ("give each sprite with work to do a chance to run" cycles through a list of active sprites, like a FOR EACH ITEM).</li>
                            <li>Exercises 3 &amp; 5:  This exercise is a little sneaky, because the optimal move at the beginning is to back up a step and then move to the east.  Still, the algorithm above works, because a backward move is allowed if it doesn't take us to an already-visited square.  So does the left-wall algorithm, although it's important to note that left-wall <em>doesn't</em> say to give up if a square has been seen before.  In this maze, the sprite will visit almost every square in the left half of the maze, then visit it again retracing its steps.  Eventually it'll return to its starting position, but facing a different direction, so its left wall will take it into the right half of the maze and a quick solution.</li>
                            <li>
                                Exercise A (Take It Further): The simplest example is to have an "island" at the entrance to the maze...
<pre>XXXXXXXXXXXXX         XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
X                                    X
X    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX                 X
X    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX                 X
X                                    X
XXXX        ^                  XXXXXXX</pre>
                                <p>At the entrance (^) there's no left wall, so we move forward, hit an obstacle, turn right, and then forever loop going counterclockwise around the island.</p>

                            <li>Exercise 1: At one time, some people thought that the goal of robotics should be to make a humanoid robot, because such a robot could use all the tools, vehicles, and so on that are designed for human beings.  But, so far at least, it has been more effective to design the robot into the tool.  For example, industrial automation uses robot arms that aren't attached to bodies.  So far, the main use of artificial human bodies, not really robots because they don't <em>do</em> anything, has been as "victims" of simulated violence or as sex objects.  They've also been used as simulated passengers by drivers who want to use carpool lanes without really carpooling, but it hasn't been very successful, because they don't really look human.  The social implications would be more serious if technology ever reaches the point of building robots that look like <em>specific</em> human beings, for example to use as stunt doubles in making movies.  This would introduce the possibility of a real-time "deepfake."</li>
                            <li>
                                Exercise 2: 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>There has been a huge flurry of writing by ethicists about this question of whose life an AI vehicle should end, if there's a choice of two bad outcomes.  The question feels bizarre, and it <em>is</em> bizarre, because ethical behavior would be to drive in a way that doesn't allow such dilemmas to arise, e.g., not driving faster than your headlights can see.  By the time you have a choice of whom to save and whom to kill, it's too late for ethics.</li>
                                    <li>The question of a fair distribution of the benefits of robots is like the same question for any technology.  One solution would be to reduce the work week without reducing pay: 30 hours work for 40 hours pay.  Another would be, as was done in some places during the COVID-19 closing of most workplaces, just to keep paying workers displaced by robots, as a matter of social justice.</li>
                                    <li>We are very, very far from developing robots with a human being's sense of self and moral agency.  So a robot can't really "commit a crime" in the same way that a person can.  If the programmer of a robot deliberately programs it to commit crimes, it's the programmer who commits the crime.  If a robot behaves destructively because of an error in its programming, then it's not a crime at all, but an industrial accident, for which the programmer is civilly liable for the cost of the damage, but is not criminally liable, unless the programming was done carelessly by the standard of the craft, in which case it depends on the skill of the lawyers.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Exercise 3: Most AI systems today are not programmed in the traditional sense of developing an algorithm and coding it, as students do in this course.  Rather, AI developers use a general program that simulates a neural net, and then <em>train</em> that network using examples of desired and undesired cases.  Research has shown that when those cases include people (for example, sick and healthy people, to teach the AI to diagnose illness) and all the examples are white people, the AI doesn't work for people of color.  The actual example that made the news was a self-driving car that failed to recognize black pedestrians as obstacles to be avoided.  That problem was solved by retraining the AI with a diverse set of pedestrians.  Since then, it has been accepted as an ethical obligation for AI developers to think about people of color (and women, and people in wheelchairs, and very young or very old people) in the training set they use.  Really, while it's super important, this should be an easy problem to solve now that we've become aware of it.

                                Create two <em>selectors</em> <code>name</code> and <code>grade</code> that, given a student record as input, report the name or grade for that student record.<br />

                        <li>Add a button (sprite) that uses your constructor to allow the user to create a student record by entering the student’s name and grade. </li>

                        <li>Add a button that generates a grade report. Use the <code>for each</code> block to go through each record in <var>class</var> and have the sprite say the student’s name and grade for a second. Format the output so that it makes sense to the user.</li>

                    Assessment Idea: Write a program that allows a user to enter words and definitions.
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                            Create an abstract data type to hold each word definition:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Create a <code>word definition</code> <em>constructor</em> that accepts two inputs: the word and the definition (both as text strings).</li>
                                <li>Create two <em>selectors</em> <code>word</code> and <code>definition</code>.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Create a variable called <var>vocab list</var> that is a list of words and their definitions and that initializes when the green flag is clicked.</li>
                        <li>Make a way for a user to enter a word and its definition. Use <code>keep</code> to determine whether a new word is already in the list of words and provide an error message to the user if it is.</li>
                        <li>Make a way for the user to read all the words included in the dictionary. Use <code>map</code> to make the sprite say all the words separated by commas.</li>
                        <li>Make a way for the user to look up the definition of a word in the vocab list.</li>
                        <li>Submit your code in whatever way your class submits work.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

        <h4><strong>Tic Tac Toe Analysis of Abstractions</strong></h4>
        <p>Students complete and refine their work on the Tic-Tac-Toe project, describe the purpose of the program (in 100 words or less), and write a description of the <strong><em>abstractions</em></strong> they used (in preparation for the <a href="http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-performance-assessment.pdf#page=3" target="_blank">AP Create Task</a>). <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/103MsT0yaGdIdAITs6MrufEv5omXkE8Tygm97T18N2z0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">This Unit 3 Assessment file</a> includes student-facing instructions and a list of the abstractions students have used in developing this project.</p>

        <h4><strong>Written Assessment Item Bank</strong></h4>
        <p>
            Adapt this collection of assessment items to your needs. It includes several multiple choice questions similar to those on the AP CSP practice exam and several short-answer questions.
