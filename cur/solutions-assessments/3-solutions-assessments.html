        <h4><strong>Lab 1: Dealing with Complexity</strong></h4>
        <div>
			<ul>
				<li>Robot in a Maze
			              <p>1.  Many answers are possible.  Besides the left-wall algorithm described later on the page, a likely student response would be something like this:
			  <ol type="(a)">
       <li>From any position there are four possible ways to move: forward, backward, to my left, or to my right.  List the ways that are not blocked by a wall.</li>
       <li>If this isn't the first move, delete any move that takes us to a position we've been in before.</li>
       <li>For each remaining possible move, make a clone and start it going in the appropriate direction.</li>
       <li>When a clone moves, have it mark the square it's in as having been visited, for the sake of rule (b).</li>
       <li><code>Hide</code> the original sprite.</li>
       <li>If there is no possible move for this sprite, delete it.</li>
       </ol>

<p>2.  The steps of the algorithm, from (a) to (f), are done in sequence.  Steps (b) and (f) involve selection.  The repetition is harder to find because it works by cloning rather than explicit looping, so this algorithm might not be a good choice for the AP Create Task.  But technically, cloning should count as repetition, which happens in the language's scheduler ("give each sprite with work to do a chance to run" cycles through a list of active sprites, like a FOR EACH ITEM).</p>

<p>3&5.  This exercise is a little sneaky, because the optimal move at the beginning is to back up a step and then move to the east.  Still, the algorithm above works, because a backward move is allowed if it doesn't take us to an already-visited square.  So does the left-wall algorithm, although it's important to note that left-wall <em>doesn't</em> say to give up if a square has been seen before.  In this maze, the sprite will visit almost every square in the left half of the maze, then visit it again retracing its steps.  Eventually it'll return to its starting position, but facing a different direction, so its left wall will take it into the right half of the maze and a quick solution.</p>

       <p>TIF A.  The simplest example is to have an "island" at the entrance to the maze</p>

<pre>XXXXXXXXXXXXX         XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
X                                    X
X    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX                 X
X    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX                 X
X                                    X
XXXX        ^                  XXXXXXX</pre>

<p>At the entrance (^) there's no left wall, so we move forward, hit an obstacle, turn right, and then forever loop going counterclockwise around the island.</p>

        <h4><strong>Tic Tac Toe Analysis of Abstractions</strong></h4>
        <p>Students complete and refine their work on the Tic-Tac-Toe project, describe the purpose of the program (in 100 words or less), and write a description of the <strong><em>abstractions</em></strong> they used (in preparation for the <a href="http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-performance-assessment.pdf#page=3" target="_blank">AP Create Task</a>). <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/103MsT0yaGdIdAITs6MrufEv5omXkE8Tygm97T18N2z0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">This Unit 3 Asssessment file</a> includes student-facing instructions and a list of the abstractions students have used in developing this project.</p>
