                                <p>Exercise 1: Optimization, because finding almost the best solution is often good enough. In many cases, heuristics can make guarantees, e.g., that the solution they find will be within 10% of the cost of the best possible solution.  (The hill climbing heuristic explained below this problem on the page doesn't have a guarantee of quality -- it's too simple a technique.  If you reach the top of a hill, it's always possible that right around the corner, so to speak, is an enormous mountain.)</p>
                                <p>There's something sort of like heuristic methods for decision problems, though.  Let's take the example "is 5,825,496,221 a prime number?"  There are pretty fast primality tests that can give you a clear No answer, but if you get a Yes there's only, let's say, a 95% probability that the number is prime.  You can run the test again, with a different starting point (I'm leaving out the mathematical details...), and get either a guaranteed No or another 95% Yes.  Since the test is pretty fast, you can test the candidate prime 100 times, and if all 100 tests say Yes, then there's well over 99% probability that the number is, in fact, prime.  People use this kind of primality test in cryptography applications, which are based on finding large primes.  If you choose a number that actually isn't prime, your security won't be as good as you think, but still perhaps not a disaster.</p>
                                <p>This sort of question is part of the subfield of Analysis of Algorithms, part of theoretical computer science.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>Exercise 2: Playing chess.  It is known that there exists a guaranteed winning strategy for whoever plays White, but nobody knows what that strategy is, and we never will, because working it out takes exponential time in the number of moves.  Human chess players have rules for analyzing how good a board position is, using things such as how many more pieces you have than your opponent, which pieces they are, and how they're distributed around the board.  The best players have an almost magical ability to glance at a chessboard and know instantly who's winning and what the next move should be.  Computers, though, have different strengths.  They can analyze every possibility for the next several moves, and thereby generate a large number of possible board configurations after those moves.  Then the computer has to use heuristics to find which possible board is best for it, and work backwards to decide where to move.</p>
                                <p>Find the biggest item is too fast an algorithm to need heuristics.  Finding the lock combination doesn't have good-enough solutions; the lock opens only if you really know the combination!  And the best spaghetti sauce is easy: don't put cheese in it.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Exercise 3: A problem is undecidable if it's not possible to solve it, even given all the time in the world, and even if they invent some new kind of computer. It isn't at all obvious that there <em>are</em> undecidable problems, but in 1936 two researchers published proofs that they exist.  One was Alan Turing, whose name everyone knows because he won World War II.  The other, Alonzo Church, was the inventor of Lambda Calculus, the computational theory of functions that gave rise, decades later, to the Lisp programming language and so indirectly to Snap!.  Church's paper actually came first, so he's the one whose name everyone should know in this area.  The two proofs are <em>constructive,</em> which means they actually produced examples of undecidable problems.</p>
                                <p>Another name people should know in this connection is Kurt GÃ¶del, who proved five years earlier that formal axiom systems, such as Euclid's axioms in geometry, can't prove every true statement about the subject they cover.  So, there are questions in geometry that Euclid's algorithms can't answer, and the same is true for <em>every</em> axiom system, not just in geometry. What Church and Turing did was to recast this decidability question as a matter of actual computational algorithms rather than axiom systems.  They showed that there are things you might want to do with your computer that can't be programmed.</p>
                                <p>What's really important for students to understand is how undecidability differs from unreasonable-time algorithms.  Some problems that were unreasonable-time 30 years ago will be polynomial-time solvable when quantum computers become really practical.  Maybe 30 years from now another entirely new kind of computer will be invented that will be able to solve even more problems in reasonable times that are now impractical.  But an undecidable problem will be undecidable forever, no matter what kind of computer comes along.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Exercise 1: This one should be easy.  The blocks are run in sequence; each one has to finish before the next one starts.  So the script will take 6+4+8 = 18 seconds.</li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Exercise 2: The easiest way to get this problem wrong is to fail to notice the <code>and wait</code> in the <code>broadcast</code> block that starts the program. This block won't be finished until both of the scripts that it starts have finished.  Those two scripts take 8 and 4 seconds, and they happen in parallel, so it takes 8 seconds for both to be finished.  Only then does the main script start the <code>wait 6 secs</code>.  So the total time is 8+6 = 14 seconds.</p>
                                <p>Note:  Some students may object that Snap<i>!</i> can't really run two threads in parallel; it just simulates that by switching back and forth between threads.  This would be true if the threads were doing useful work.  But the <code>wait</code> block doesn't actually use up 4 or 6 or 8 seconds of processor time,  Instead, the <code>wait</code> block tells Snap<i>!</i> "Take me out of the list of threads wanting to run, until ___ seconds from now."  This is why we use <code>wait</code> in these examples, rather than something more practical.  Since a waiting thread doesn't use any of the processor time, several can be waiting truly in parallel.</p>

                            <li><p>Exercise 3: Completing the table:</p>

                                Exercise 4: 
                                <ol>
                                    <li>One processor takes 61 minutes; two processors take 31 minutes.  Adding one processor saved half an hour of computation.</li>
                                    <li>240 processors take 1.25 minutes; 480 processors take 1.125 minutes.  Adding 240 processors saved 1/8 of a minute (7.5 seconds).</li>
                                    <li>A really good answer to this question would require knowing the cost of a processor.  If you're Google, you probably pay less than a dollar for a processor.  (Remember, several can be on the same chip.)  So adding 240 processors isn't as big a deal as it sounds; if this same computation is going to be repeated thousands of times every day, spending $240 might be worth it.  But if you're <em>not</em> Google and a processor costs you $50, you might think four processors are more than enough.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Exercise 5: This problem basically checks whether they've read the text on the page.  The benefit of parallel computation is reducing the time required to solve a problem or, equivalently, increasing the number of problems you can solve in a given amount of time.  The disadvantages are increased hardware failure rate, potential conflicts between processes, and difficult programming.</li>
                            <li>Exercise 6 (If There Is Time): The programs are the same as in problems 1 and 2.  The sequential time (prob. 1) is 18 seconds; the parallel time (prob. 2) is 14 seconds.  So the speedup is 18/14.  (Some students will feel intuitively that the formula should be parallel/sequential, which would be "what fraction of the sequential time does the parallel version take?"  But if we want to measure the speedup due to parallelism, we want an answer greater than 1; "the parallel version is twice as fast," for example.  Don't let students say "two times faster," an incoherent neologism.)</li>

                                    <li>Impractical:  Add a lane to the highway and see if that improves the traffic jams.  What if it's a carpool lane?  Etc.</li>

A more real-life example is that physicists want to know about the nature of physical laws during the first fraction of a second after the creation of the universe.</li>
                                    <li>Unethical:  We are writing these solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and so there are many real-life examples of things researchers want to know that are hard to find out without deliberately infecting volunteers, such as how long an infected person remains contagious, and what fraction of infected people develop symptoms.</li>

                                Exercise 2: Simulations allow performing quasi-experiments in the computer model, and the results can indicate likely results if the same experiment were made in the real world.  Visual display of information can help people understand the phenomena; for example, a computer can display a planetary orbit so the experimenter can see the result rather than just seeing equations describing the result.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Pro: Computers can model the impractical, impossible, or unethical situations that would otherwise not be available for experiments.  Even when something can be done in the real world, computer modeling is generally much cheaper and faster, so many experiments can be made instead of only a few.  (For example, auto body designs are tested in simulated wind tunnels many times, until the designers think they have the optimal shape, and only then do they actually build a physical car and try it in a physical wind tunnel.)</li>
                                    <li>Con:  There's only one big problem with computer modeling, but it's a crucial one:  The simplifications made in building the computer model may be more important than the developers think, and so the results may not really be correct.  This is especially likely when modeling very complex systems, in which a small error in one piece of the model may have much larger effects in other pieces.  A related problem is that sometimes the model-builders make simplifications that they <em>know</em> are importantly wrong, but they don't know how to build a better one.  For example, many economists assume that everyone in a society has perfect access to relevant information, and always behaves rationally.  This is <em>so</em> wrong that their conclusions aren't very convincing to anyone who looks at a real economy.  The risk of oversimplified assumptions is particularly great in social sciences, where prejudice based on race, sex, etc. can affect the simulation.  (Prejudice can affect real-world experiments, too, but at least the assumptions are more visible and can be criticized.)</li>

                                Exercise 1: If Adam is a False-Teller, then they are <em>not</em> from the same family, and so Eve is a Truthteller. If Adam is a Truthteller, then they <em>are</em> from the same family, and still Eve is a Truthteller. Either way, Eve is a Truthteller, but there is no way to know for sure which family Adam is from.

However, if the statement is false, then because it says it is false, it must be true. Neither makes sense.</li>

If Max were a Truthteller, then he would not say that they were both liars. So, the only possibility is that Max is a False-Teller, in which case, the statement must be a lie; so they are <em>not</em> both False-Tellers, and Min must be a Truthteller. Thus, the statement is definitely resolvable.</li>

                                    <li>In a proof by contradiction, you start by assuming the <em>opposite</em> of what you're trying to prove, and from there you derive a contradiction.  You prove that the opposite <em>can't</em> be true, which means the original goal must be true.  (By the way, although it's an unusual position today, around 1900 there was a strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionism" title="Wikipedia article on Intuitionism that discusses the group of of mathematicians who rejected proof by contradiction" target="_blank">group of mathematicians</a> who rejected proof by contradiction.  So if your students have trouble with the idea, they're in good company!)</li>
                                    <li>The <code>halts?</code> function takes a reporter (that is, a function; for example, <code>f</code>) and an input value (an argument; for example, <code>x</code>) and reports <code>true</code> if and only if the computation of <code>f(x)</code> will report a value in finite time.  In other words, <code>halts?</code> is (supposedly) able to detect an infinite loop in any program.  (Note that this proof would be impossible in a programming language in which procedures can't be used as data, that is, in which a function couldn't be used as input to another function, such as inputting <code>f</code> into <code>halts?</code>.  The Halting Theorem would still be true, but proving it would be a lot harder&mdash;as it was for Turing.)</li>
                                    <li>We construct a procedure <code>tester</code> so that it reports a value if and only if <code>halts?</code> says that <code>f(f)</code> loops forever for some given function <code>f</code> but also so that <code>tester</code> loops forever if <code>halts?</code> says that <code>f(f)</code> reports a value.  So, whatever <code>f</code> does, <code>tester</code> does the opposite.  Then we call <code>tester</code> on itself: <code>tester(tester)</code>.  Whatever <code>halts?</code> says that <code>tester</code> will do, <code>tester</code> will be forced to actually do the opposite.  That's a contradiction, and so an infallible <code>halts?</code> can't exist.</li>

                                <p>Exercise 3: Metal-clad ships were fairly new at the time of the Civil War.  Wooden ships were not only easier for cannonball to penetrate, but very vulnerable to fire.  The South were first (1861) to deploy an ironclad, but by 1862 the North had seven smaller ironclads, as well as the large <em>USS Monitor</em>.  Seeing an urgent need to match the <em>Monitor,</em> the South raised the scuttled (deliberately sunk) <em>USS Merrimack,</em> clad it in iron, and rechristened it the <em>CSS Virginia.</em>  The first battle (worldwide) between two ironclads was the Battle of Hampton Roads, in which the <em>Virginia</em> was destroying several wooden ships of the North until the barely-built <em>Monitor</em> rushed to the scene and drove off the <em>Virginia</em>.  Both ships survived the encounter, but each was destroyed later in the war.  It quickly became clear that a wooden ship could not survive battle with an ironclad.</p>
                                <p>The gunpowder that provided the propellant force for rifles until the 1880s filled battlefields with thick black smoke, making it hard to tell allies from enemies.  Bright colored uniforms helped improve visibility.  Improved weaponry reduced the smoke problem, at which point it became more important to keep one's own soldiers hidden from the enemy.  Dull colors that blended with the landscape then became the standard.</p>
                                <p>Before airplanes were used in warfare, there were generally well-defined battlefields, and rules of war disallowed attacks on civilians.  But military airplanes don't have riflemen; they have bombs, which kill people over a wide area.  A civilian anywhere near a battlefield could no longer rely on being protected by wearing civilian clothing.  And once air war became common, it didn't take long until bombs were dropped on cities.  Today there is really no such thing as a "noncombatant."</p>

                                    <li>The story of the Manhattan Project is well known.

                                    <li>GPS was a Defense Department project, motivated originally by the desire to get very precise coordinates for bombings of specific buildings, but also used to allow battlefield officers to know precisely which soldier is where despite the chaos of battle.</li>
                                    <li>The Internet was meant to ensure high-reliability communication through network redundancy, and to allow more efficient use of communication circuits through packet switching, which allows many conversations over the same circuit.  Many people believe that the technology was developed specifically for the sake of a network that would survive a nuclear attack on the United States, but this is apparently not the case.  (For one thing, few <em>computers</em> would survive the strong electromagnetic pulse that is a side effect of a nuclear explosion.)</li>

                            <li>Exercise 2: The Roomba automatic vacuum cleaner started life as a military robot.  Drones, first used as weapons, are now widely available for news coverage and even as toys.  Radar, developed to detect enemy missiles or vehicles, is now used to police highway speed (unpopular, but life-saving) and to enable adaptive cruise control (which slows down your car if it get too near to the car in front of it).  Several weapons, especially non-fatal ones, have moved from military to police use, e.g., tear gas.  The technology to develop vaccines also serves to develop biological weapons (although they are outlawed by international treaties).  Night vision technology has many civilian uses but its export is regulated as a munition because soldiers use it for night attacks.</li>
                            <li>Exercise 3: This question is deliberately phrased provocatively.  The first part is rhetorical; of course killing someone is worse than deleting their computer files.  But the second is not rhetorical.  It's important to understand that institutions have a character of their own, separate from that of the people who make up the institution.  Nobody at the ACM is in favor of killing people!  But their principles for the conduct of members are, at best, silent on the question, while voluble about lesser harms.</li>
                            <li>Exercise 4: This is a question about ethics, not about computer science, and there is room for disagreement.  But students who argue that the United States should have the best possible weapons, because we're the good guys, should read Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States" title="list of wars involving the United States">list of wars involving the United States</a>.  Compare the two occasions in all of its history when the United States was invaded militarily and had to defend itself (War of 1812, Pearl Harbor) with the countless invasions of other countries by the US.  (This is not to suggest that the US is especially evil!  But it's not especially benevolent either.  It's a country like many others.)</li>

                    <ul>
                    	<li><code>Number guessing game - player guesser</code> where the computer picks the number and tells the player if their guesses are too high or too low</li>
