						<ul>
							<li>Exercise 1. Five.  Level 1 is the trunk, level 2 are the smaller branches just above the trunk, and so on.</li>
							<li>Exercise 2. Flipped upside down.  It's easy to be confused about this, since all the emphasis in this lab is on levels, but this question is asking about the <var>size</var> input, which doesn't affect the flow of control in the recursive process.  It just makes the sprite move backward.  In the recursive calls, the size is multiplied by a fraction, but the result is still negative.</li>
							<li>Exercise 3. This time, the question <em>is</em> asking about the <var>level</var> input.  If it's negative in the first call, each computation of <var>level</var><code> − 1</code> just makes the result more negative, so it'll never be equal to 1, which is the base case test.  So it always takes the left branch, with smaller and smaller lengths.</li>
							<li>Exercise 4. Change the base case test to <var>level</var><code> &lt; 2</code>, which will be true for any negative value.  <var>level</var><code> &lt; 1</code> will work also, so don't mark it wrong.</li>

						<ul>
							<li>Exercise 1: The turn amount.  The sizes of the branches haven't changed, but all of them are left of center, which means that the turn just before the second recursive call has become a left turn, by some amount less than 15 degrees.  It looks like about 5 degrees.  And of course the turn following that recursive call has to become a right turn by five degrees.</li>
							<li>Exercise 2: Additional recursive calls.  It may be hard to see what's happening near the top of the tree, but look at the top of the trunk, and you can clearly see five branches at different angles.</li>
							<li>Exercise 3: The scaling factor.  The branches are getting larger in the recursive calls, not smaller.</li>
							<li>Exercise 4: The scaling factor again. This time, the scaling factor is 1, i.e., the length isn't changing in the recursive calls.</li>
							<li>Exercise 5: The turn amount, which has changed to 90 degrees.  The result no longer looks like a tree; it's more like an old-fashioned TV antenna, in the days before cable.  But it's still basically the same tree program.</li>

								<ul>
									<li>Exercise 7: There is actually a lot of variation in the number of rectangles in Mondrian's paintings.  Sometimes he used very few, roughly like level 2 or 3 in this program. There's clearly no correct answer to this question, but we used level 6 to make the pictures on the lab page.  That seems about the limit.</li>
									<li>Exercise 8 (If There Is Time): Mondrian wanted the rectangles to jump out of the painting and grab the viewer's attention.  The specific colors were less important to him than the arrangement of shapes.  Using the same colors in every picture prevents the viewer putting too much weight on the coloring: "I don't like this one because it's purple."</li>
									<li>
										Exercise 9 (If There Is Time): The biggest problem with our algorithm is that Mondrian didn't only make lines that entirely divide an area into two pieces.  He would, for example, draw a line that only partly divides the space.
										Here's an example:<br />
										<div class="sidenote"> <small>Composition No. 10. 1939-42. Piet Mondrian. Oil on canvas. 80 × 73 cm. Private collection. Public domain. Via <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Piet_Mondriaan,_1939-1942_-_Composition_10.jpg" title="Wikimedia source of Mondrian painting" target="_blank">Wikimedia</a>.</small></div>
										<img class="noshadow indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/mondrian-tg.jpg" width="210" alt="a Mondrian picture" title="a Mondrian picture"><br />
										Look at the horizontal line that runs into the yellow box at the left.  It crosses two verticals but stops at the third one.  Also, that line is thinner than the horizontal lines above and below it.  A better program would first put down lines, and then choose colors to fill some of the regions.  It would also have a system for positioning the lines.  In this picture there's a central rectangle with a small space to its left and two small spaces to its right, not counting the partial spaces that run off the ends of the canvas.
