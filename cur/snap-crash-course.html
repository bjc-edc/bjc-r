            Once you've learned how to program in one language (at least any language that your AP Computer Science Principles class would have used), it's <em>much</em> easier to learn another language. And Snap<em>!</em> will be especially easy to pick up quickly because it's all visual; you just snap blocks together, and you don't have to worry about any syntax (parentheses, commas, semicolons, quotation marks, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>This page is designed to get you up and running in Snap<em>!</em> as quickly as possible. It will help you pick up Snap<em>!</em> quickly if you take the time to read (or at least skim) this whole page. Click the links below to learn about each topic.</p>

                    <li>The <strong>Sprite Corral</strong> lets you select the sprite (or the stage) you want to work with (either to write or to view code; to control the costumes or background; or to select, import, and record sounds).</li>

                There are two primary ways to share your Snap<em>!</em> projects: sending an XML file containing a copy of your project; and creating a link to your active project file.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Exporting an XML file:</strong> If you send someone an XML copy of your project, they will have a snapshot of your work at that day and time; if you make changes to your project, their copy will not change. (If they make changes to their copy, your project won't change.) To create an XML file, choose "Export project..." from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>), and an XML file will download to your computer that you can share with others. They can then import that file in Snap<em>!</em> to see your project.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Importing an XML file:</strong> The recipient must either drag the XML file into the Snap<em>!</em> window or choose "Import..." from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu and locate the file on their computer. Importing a project will close any project that is open in that Snap<em>!</em> window.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Creating a link:</strong> If your project is saved in the Snap<em>!</em> cloud, you can "Share" it, which will make a URL (link) to your project.  If you email someone that link, then they will be able to see your project and any changes that you make to it in the future (unless you "Unshare" it). They can't edit your project, but they can save a copy to their Snap<em>!</em> account and edit that. To create a link:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Make sure your current project is saved, and then open the project you want to share.</li>
                            <li>Then choose "Open..." from the File menu again, and select the project you want to share from the project list.</li>
                            <li>Click "Share," and then click "Yes" to share. Then click "Cancel" to close the menu.</li>
                            <li>
                                The URL (the link) at the top of the browser window will have changed.  Copy this new URL, and send it to someone else to share the project. <a href="#hint-URL" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for images that show where the URL is and how it changes.">Click for images that show where the URL is and how it changes.</a>

        <h3>Code-Building Basics</h3>


        <h4><strong><a href="#hint-creating" data-toggle="collapse" class="collapsed expansion-menu" title="Creating Scripts">Creating Scripts</a></strong></h4>
        <div id="hint-creating" class="collapse">
            <p></p>

            <p>In Snap<em>!</em>, you drag and attach blocks together to create your scripts. You can learn more about a particular block by right-clicking it (or control-clicking it on a Mac) and selecting "help..." which will bring up a little window with information about how the block works. You can also just click a block to see what it does. <a href="#hint-help" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an example of accessing the Help menu for a pen block.">Click for an example of accessing the Help menu for a pen block.</a></p>
            <div id="hint-help" class="collapse">

            </div>
            <p>
                Every script you build in Snap<em>!</em> belongs either to a sprite or to the stage. Identifying words in block names such as "I" or "my" refer to that sprite or to the stage (depending on which one is selected in the sprite corral):<br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/my-costume-reporting-bear.png" alt="my (costume) reporting a small picture of a white bear waving" title="my (costume) reporting a small picture of a white bear waving" />

            </p>
            <p>
                Some blocks have little arrows that allow to you to control the inputs:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Downward pointing arrows (<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:.6em;">&#9660;</span>) indicate dropdown menus with additional options:<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/set-a-to-expression.png" alt="set (a) to (expression)" title="set (a) to (expression)" />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/item.png" alt="item (1) of 'list input slot'" title="item (1) of 'list input slot'" />

                        If the downarrow is in a <em>white</em> box, as in the <code>item</code> block above, you can either choose from the menu or type your own value into the box.  If the box is block-colored, you can only use the choices in the menu.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Left/right arrows (<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:.6em;">&#9664; &#9654;</span>) indicate that you can control the number of input slots:<br />

                There are several different block shapes in Snap<em>!</em>, and they each have their own meaning and places they can be used:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>Commands</em> have a rectangular, jigsaw-puzzle-piece shape. These are instructions that tell the computer to do something. They are designed to be snapped together one below another. Here are a few command procedures:<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-full-size.png" alt="go to x: ( ) y: ( )" title="go to x: ( ) y: ( )" />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/clear-full-size.png" alt="clear" title="clear" />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-empty.png" alt="set ( ) to ( )" title="set ( ) to ( )" />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Reporters</em> have a rounded shape. These blocks report (return) a value. They can either be clicked to report a value to the programmer or be dropped into an input slot of another block, in which case they report a value to that other block.  Here are a few reporter procedures and their current output values:<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/x-position-reporting-103.png" alt="x position reporting 103" title="x position reporting 103" />

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <em>Predicates</em> have a hexagonal shape. They are are a special kind of reporter that only reports <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. They are used inside other blocks to help a program decide when to do something or what to report. Here are a few predicate procedures:<br />
                                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/greater-than.png" alt="( ) > ( )" title="( ) > ( )" />

                                And here are a few blocks that take Booleans (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) as input:<br />

                        <em>Hat blocks</em> have a hat shape on top and a puzzle-piece shape at the bottom. They detect an event such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="Green Flag button" title="Green Flag button" />). They can only go at the beginning of a script, and they tell rest of that script to run when that event occurs. (Not every script needs a hat block; you can also run a script by clicking on it.) Here are a few hat blocks:<br />

        <div id="hint-communicating" class="collapse">
            <p>Of course, you can use global variables (more about them below) to share information between sprites, but you can also send messages between your sprites or have one sprite tell another sprite what to do:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sending messages:</strong> The <code>broadcast</code> block sends a message to <em>all</em> the sprites. To set the message, click the down arrow and select "new..."<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/broadcast-open.png" alt="broadcast block with menu open showing one option: new..." title="broadcast block with menu open showing one option: new..." />

                        <br />
                        Once that message has been sent out, any scripts in your project that begin with the <code>when I receive</code> hat block with that same message will run: <br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/when-i-receive-showing-game-ready.png" alt="when I receive (game ready to start)" title="when I receive (game ready to start)" />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>Tell</code>ing sprites what to do:</strong> You can tell a specific sprite (or the stage) what to do by using the <code>tell</code> block to send instructions (not just messages):
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/tell-sprite-2.png" alt="tell (Sprite2) to (go to x:(0) y:(0), stamp, say (I moved and stamped a copy of myself onto the stage!))" title="tell (Sprite2) to (go to x:(0) y:(0), stamp, say (I moved and stamped a copy of myself onto the stage!))" />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><code>Ask</code>ing sprites questions:</strong> You can ask a specific sprite (or the stage) a question using the <code>ask</code> block to send an expression:<br />

        </div>

        <h4><strong><a href="#hint-variables" data-toggle="collapse" class="collapsed expansion-menu" title="Creating Variables">Creating Variables</a></strong></h4>
        <div id="hint-variables" class="collapse">
            <p>There are several kinds of variables in Snap<em>!</em>. Here are the most important:
                <ul>
                    <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/draw-square-def.png" alt="draw square, size: (size) {
    pen down
    repeat (4) {
        move (size) steps
        turn ↻ (90) degrees
    }
}" title="draw square, size: (size) {
    pen down
    repeat (4) {
        move (size) steps
        turn ↻ (90) degrees
    }
}" />
                    <li><strong>Input variables (parameters)</strong> store the input values (arguments) passed to a custom block. For example, <var>size</var> is an input variable to the <code>draw square</code> block shown at right. There is more information about creating blocks with input parameters below.</li>
                    <li><strong>Script (local) variables</strong> only exist within the script that creates them. You can create script variables using the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/script-variables(a).png" alt="script variables (a)" title="script variables (a)" /> block. Place that block at the point in your code where you want to create a variable. You can click a variable name in the <code>script variables</code> block to change the name; you can click the right arrow (<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size:.6em;">&#9654;</span>) to create additional variables at the same point in your program. To use a script variable, drag it from the <code>script variables</code> block to wherever you want to use it (in the same script).</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Iteration variables</strong> change in value as a block repeats a set of commands. You can change the name of an iteration variable by clicking on it. In Snap<em>!</em>, there are two iteration blocks that have built in variables: <code>for</code> uses <var>i</var> (unless you change the name) to hold the index number of the iteration, and <code>for each</code> uses <var>item</var> (unless you change the name) to hold each list item as it traverses (travels through) the list:<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/for-full-size.png" alt="for (i) = (1) to (10) 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" title="for (i) = (1) to (10) 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/for-each-(item)-of().png" alt="for each (item) of 'list input slot' 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" title="for each (item) of 'list input slot' 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" />
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Global variables</strong> can be accessed from anywhere in your program. You can create them by clicking the <img class="inlines" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/make-a-variable.png" alt="Make a Variable" title="" />button in the Variables palette.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Because Snap<em>!</em> is a visual language (not a text-based language), you can use multi-word variable names. It will be clear to you and others when reading the code that those separate words are all part of the same variable name:<br />

            <div class="pseudop">Snap<em>!</em> uses <em>lists</em> to group a bunch of values. If you learned to program in another language, you may have used <em>arrays</em>. In Snap<em>!</em>, lists are ordered, and <strong>the first item in a list is item number 1.</strong> (Some other languages count items from 0 instead of from 1, so <pre class="inline">myList[3]</pre> is <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/my-list-3.png" alt="item (4) of (my list)" title="item (4) of (my list)" />.)</div>

                To create a list, use the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/list-full-size.png" alt="list ( )" title="list ( )" /> block.  Snap<em>!</em> provides the standard list processing functions:<br />

                The gray rings are the equivalent of <pre class="inline">function</pre> or <pre class="inline">lambda</pre> in other languages.

                Some other common list functions aren't built into Snap<em>!</em>, but are available in a library: Select "Libraries..." from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu, and choose "List utilities" near the top of the list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python users can use Snap<em>!</em> lists to recreate the behavior of other data aggregates:
                <ul>
                    <li>A <pre class="inline">tuple</pre> is just a list that you don't modify.</li>
                    <li>A <pre class="inline">set</pre> is unordered; so just use a list and don't make any assumptions about order. Also, Python sets aren't supposed to include the same value more than once. So when you extend a set, use <code>remove duplicates</code> from the Snap<em>!</em> "List Utilities" library.</li>
                    <li>
                        A <pre class="inline">dictionary</pre> is just a list of two-item lists. In each small list, the first item is the <em>key</em> and the second item is the <em>value</em>. In Snap<em>!</em>, this might look like:<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/dictionary-example.png" alt="list (list (first name) (Betsy)) (list (last name) (Anderson)) (list (phone number) (212-555-1234))" title="list (list (first name) (Betsy)) (list (last name) (Anderson)) (list (phone number) (212-555-1234))" /><br />
                        In Snap<em>!</em>, you can use <code>assoc</code> from the "List Utilities" library to search for a key-value pair and then use <code>item (2) of</code> to select the value.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Recursion also lets you traverse a list, just as <code>for each</code> does, but without the use of index variables.  Instead, you split the list into its first item and everything else:<br />

            </p>
            <p>
                You compute some function of the first item, and combine that with a call to the same procedure you're writing, but on the smaller list that remains:

                There are several ways to see the value of variables and sprite attributes while your code is running:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Clicking on a reporter</strong> will make it report its value.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/show-variable-full-size.png" alt="show variable" title="show variable" />block </strong> displays a watcher on the stage, which is useful for script variables since they aren't shown in the palette.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Right-clicking on a script that's running</strong> shows a menu with extra options to display watchers for each currently existing script variable. <a href="#hint-temp-vars" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an example of showing temporary variable watchers.">Click for an example of showing temporary variable watchers.</a>

                One way to avoid having bugs in your program in the first place is to keep your code organized:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can <strong>clean up your scripting area</strong> by right-clicking (or control-clicking on a Mac) the scripting area and selecting "clean up." This will reposition the scripts so they don't overlap.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can <strong>remove a script</strong> from your project by dragging it out of the scripting area and into the palette.  (If you drag a block out of the middle of a script, that block and all the ones below it will be removed; the part of the script above that block will remain.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can <strong>delete a single block</strong> from a script by right-clicking (or control-clicking on a Mac) that block and choosing the "delete" option. (Note that removing a block or script from your scripting area is different from the "delete block definition" option which will permanently delete a custom block and all its instances from your entire project.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can <strong>delete all the unused blocks</strong> from your project by selecting "Unused blocks..." from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu. This allows you to permanently delete custom or imported blocks that aren't being used by your project. This is often helpful when you've loaded a library but you only need one or two blocks from that library. (More about libraries below.)
                    </li>        
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                You can add comments to your Snap<em>!</em> code by right-clicking (or control-clicking) in the Scripts area and choosing "add comment." <a href="#hint-comments" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an animation that shows how to add comments.">Click for an animation that shows how.</a>

            <p>
                You can create a help message for your block by attaching a comment to the hat block in the Block Editor. Then people using your block can find out what your block does without having to look inside. These work just like the help messages for built-in blocks.
