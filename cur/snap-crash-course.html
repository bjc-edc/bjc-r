            Once you've learned how to program in one language (at least any language that your AP Computer Science Principles class would have used), it's <em>much</em> easier to learn another language. And Snap<em>!</em> will be especially easy to pick up quickly because it's all visual; you just snap blocks together, and you don't have to worry about any syntax (parentheses, commas, semicolons, quotation marks, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>This page is designed to get you up and running in Snap<em>!</em> as quickly as possible. It will help you pick up Snap<em>!</em> quickly if you take the time to read (or at least skim) this whole page. Click the links below to learn about each topic.</p>

            <p>You will want to create a Snap<em>!</em> account so you can save and access all your Snap<em>!</em> projects in the cloud. (Technically don't need an account; you could download all your Snap<em>!</em> projects, save them locally, and then load them from your computer, but it is highly recommended to use one.) Instructions for creating an account and logging into and out of your Snap<em>!</em> account are on the first page of the Beauty and Joy of Computing CSP curriculum:

                        The <strong>Palette</strong> includes eight menus (shown right), where you will find all the blocks (procedures) in your project (built-in blocks, imported blocks, and custom blocks).

                    <li>The <strong>Stage</strong> is the user interface for your project. One or more <em>sprites</em> (characters) live on and can talk and move around on the stage. Sprites begin with an arrowhead costume (as shown in the picture above), but you can change a sprite's costume (the picture that it wears) using the Costumes menu inside the File menu (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Scripting Area</strong> is where you drag blocks from the palette and snap them together to build your code. Above the scripting area are three tabs that allow you to view and edit the Scripts, Costumes (or Backgrounds), and Sounds for the sprite (or the stage) that you have selected in the "Sprite Corral."</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Sprite Corral</strong> lets you select the sprite (or the stage) you want to work with (either to write or view code; to control the costumes or background; or to select, import, and record sounds).</li>

                There are two primary ways to share your Snap<em>!</em> projects: sending an XML file containing a copy of your project; and creating a link to your active project file.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Exporting an XML file:</strong> If you send someone an XML copy of your project, they will have a copy of your work from that day and time; if you make changes to your project, their copy will not change. (If they make changes to their copy, your project won't change.) To create an XML file: choose "Export project..." from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>), and an XML file will download to your computer that you can share with others. They can then import that file in Snap<em>!</em> to see your project.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Importing an XML file:</strong> The recipient must either drag the XML file into the Snap<em>!</em> window (this will close any project they have open) or choose "Import..." from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu and locate the file on their computer.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Creating a link:</strong> If you send someone a URL (link) to your project, they will be able to see your project and any changes that you make to it in the future (unless you "unshare" it). They can't edit your project, but they can save a copy to their Snap<em>!</em> account and edit that. To create a link:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Make sure your project is saved.</li>
                            <li>Choose "Open..." from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File button" title="File button"/>), and select the project you want to share from the project list.</li>
                            <li>Click "Share," and then click "Yes" to share. Then click "Cancel" to close the menu.</li>
                            <li>
                                The URL (the link) at the top of the browser window will have changed.  Copy this new URL, and send it to someone else to share the project. <a href="#hint-URL" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for images that show where the URL is and how it changes.">Click for images that show where the URL is and how it changes.</a>

                        <strong>"Unsharing" a link:</strong> If you want an existing link to your project to stop working for other people, you can "unshare" it. To "unshare" a link:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Choose "Open..." from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File button" title="File button"/>), and select the project you want to unshare from the project list.</li>

            <p>
                Drag one block underneath another to snap them together as you create your scripts. Every script you build in Snap<em>!</em> belongs either to a sprite or to the stage. Identifying words in block names such as "I" or "my" refer to that sprite or to the stage (depending on which one is selected in the sprite corral):<br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/my-costume-reporting-bear.png" alt="my (costume) reporting a small picture of a white bear waving" title="my (costume) reporting a small picture of a white bear waving" />

            </p>
            <p>
                Some blocks have little arrows that allow to you to control the inputs:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Downward pointing arrows (&blacktriangledown;) indicate dropdown menus with additional options:<br />

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Left/right arrows (&blacktriangleleft; &blacktriangleright;) indicate that you can control the number of input slots:<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/join-hello-world-reporting.png" alt="join (hello ) (world) reporting 'hello world'" title="join (hello ) (world) reporting 'hello world'" />

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>You can learn more about a particular block quickly by right-clicking it (or control-clicking it on a Mac) and selecting "help..." which will bring up a little window with information about how the block works. You can also just click it to see what it does.</p>
        </div>


        <a href="#hint-shapes" data-toggle="collapse" class="collapsed expansion-menu" title="Block Shapes"><h4><strong>Block Shapes</strong></h4></a>
        <div id="hint-shapes" class="collapse">
            <p>
                There are several different block shapes in Snap<em>!</em>, and they each have their own meaning and places they can be used:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>Commands</em> have a rectangular, puzzle-piece shape. These are instructions that tell the computer to do something. They are designed to be snapped together one after another. Here are a few commands:<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-full-size.png" alt="go to x: ( ) y: ( )" title="go to x: ( ) y: ( )" />

                    <li>
                        <em>Reporters</em> have a rounded shape. These blocks report (return) a value. They can either be clicked to report a value to the programmer or they can be dropped into an empty input slot of another block and used as input. Here are a few reporters reporting values:<br />

                                <em>Predicates</em> have a hexagonal shape. They are are a special kind of reporter that only reports <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. They are used inside other blocks to help a program decide when to do something or what to report. Here are a few predicates:<br />

                        <em>Hat blocks</em> have a hat shape on top and a puzzle-piece shape at the bottom. They detect an event such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>). They can only go at the beginning of a script, and they tell rest of that script to run when that event occurs. (Not every script needs a hat block; you can also run a script by clicking on it.) Here are a few hat blocks:<br />

            <p>Of course, you can use global variables (more about them below) to share information between sprites, but you can also send messages between your sprites or have one sprite tell another sprite what to do:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sending messages:</strong> The <code>broadcast</code> block sends a message to all the sprites. To set the message, click the down arrow and select "new..."<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/broadcast-open.png" alt="broadcast block with menu open showing one option: new..." title="broadcast block with menu open showing one option: new..." />

                        <br />
                        Once that message has been sent out, any scripts in your project that begin with the <code>when I receive</code> hat block with hat same message will run: <br />

                    <li>
                        <strong><code>Tell</code>ing sprites what to do:</strong> You can tell a specific sprite (or the stage) what to do by using the <code>tell</code> block to send instructions (not just messages):

        <a href="#hint-variables" data-toggle="collapse" class="collapsed expansion-menu" title="Creating Variables"><h4><strong>Creating Variables</strong></h4></a>
        <div id="hint-variables" class="collapse">
            <p>There are several kinds of variables in Snap<em>!</em>. Here are the most important:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Global variables</strong> can be accessed from anywhere in your program. You can create them by clicking the <img class="inlines" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/make-a-variable.png" alt="Make a Variable" title="" />button in the Variables palette.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local (script variables)</strong> only exist within the script that creates them. You can create local variables using the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/script-variables(a).png" alt="script variables (a)" title="script variables (a)" /> block. Place that block at the point in your code where you want to create a variable, click the variable name to change it if you want, click the right arrow (&blacktriangleright;) if you want to create additional variables at the same point in your program, and drag the variable off to use it in the code below it.</li>
                    <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/draw-square-def.png" alt="draw square, size: (size) {
    pen down
    repeat (4) {
        move (size) steps
        turn ↻ (90) degrees
    }
}" title="draw square, size: (size) {
    pen down
    repeat (4) {
        move (size) steps
        turn ↻ (90) degrees
    }
}" />
                    <li><strong>Input variables (parameters)</strong> store the input values (arguments) passed to a custom block. For example, <var>size</var> is an input variable to the <code>draw square</code> block shown at right. There is more information about creating blocks with input parameters below.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Iteration variables</strong> change in value as a block repeats a set of commands. You can change the name of an iteration variable by clicking on it. In Snap<em>!</em>, there are two iteration blocks that have built in variables: <code>for</code> uses <var>i</var> (unless you change the name) to hold the index number of the iteration, and <code>for each</code> uses <var>item</var> (unless you change the name) to hold each list item as it traverses (travels through) the list:<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/for-full-size.png" alt="for (i) = (1) to (10) 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" title="for (i) = (1) to (10) 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/for-each-(item)-of().png" alt="for each (item) of 'list input slot' 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" title="for each (item) of 'list input slot' 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" />
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Because Snap<em>!</em> is a visual language (not a text-based language), you can use multi-word variable names. It will be clear to you and others when reading the code that those separate words are all part of the same variable name:<br />

            <p>Snap<em>!</em> uses <em>lists</em> to group a bunch of values. If you learned to program in another language, you may have used arrays. In Snap<em>!</em>, lists are ordered, and the first item in a list is item number 1. (Some languages have the first the first item be 0, and the second is 1, the third is 2, etc.). Also in Snap<em>!</em>, list items do not all have to be the same data type. For example, a single list can contain text, numbers, images, sounds, blocks, and even other lists.</p>
            <p>To create a list, use the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/list-full-size.png" alt="list ( )" title="list ( )" /> block. You can read about several other commonly used Snap<em>!</em> list blocks on the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/reference-sheet.html" title="Snap! vs. AP Exam Language">Snap<em>!</em> vs. AP Exam Language</a> page:<br />

                Python users can use Snap<em>!</em> lists to recreate the behavior of data aggregates:
                <ul>
                    <li>A <pre class="inline">tuple</pre> is just a list that you don't modify.</li>
                    <li>A <pre class="inline">set</pre> is unordered; so just use a list and don't make any assumptions about order. Also, Python sets aren't supposed to include the same value more than once. So when you extend a set, use <code>remove duplicates</code> from the Snap<em>!</em> "List Utilities" library, which you can access from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu.</li>
                    <li>
                        A <pre class="inline">dictionary</pre> is just a list of two-item lists. In each small list, the first item is the <em>key</em> and the second item is the <em>value</em>. In Snap<em>!</em>, this might look like:<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/dictionary-example.png" alt="list (list (first name) (Betsy)) (list (last name) (Anderson)) (list (phone number) (212-555-1234))" title="list (list (first name) (Betsy)) (list (last name) (Anderson)) (list (phone number) (212-555-1234))" /><br />
                        In Snap<em>!</em>, you can use <code>assoc</code> from the "List Utilities" library to search for a key-value pair and then use <code>item (2) of</code> to select the value.
                    </li>

                Recursion also lets you deal with a list by traversal, like <code>for each</code> does, but without the use of index variables.  Instead, you split the list into its first item and everything else:<br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/item-1-of-fruits-reporting.png" alt="item (1) of (list (apple) (banana) (orange) (grape)) reporting 'apple'" title="item (1) of (list (apple) (banana) (orange) (grape)) reporting 'apple'" />

            </p>
            <p>
                You compute some function of the first item, and combine that with a call to the same procedure you're writing:
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/plurals-definition.png" alt="plurals (words ‘list input symbol’) {
        if (is (words) empty?) {

        } else {

        }
    }" title="plurals (words ‘list input symbol’) {
        if (is (words) empty?) {
            report (list)
        } else {
            report ((join (item (1) of (words)) (s)) in front of (plurals (all but first of (words))))
        }
    }" />
