        <h3>Showing Your Code for the AP Create Task</h3>
        <p>Snap<em>!</em> has two convenient ways to share some or all of your code.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>Creating Script Pics</strong></h4>
        <p>
        	You can download a PNG image file of any block or script by right-clicking it (or control-clicking it on a mac) and selecting "script pic..."  If a new window opens with the picture, use your browser's Save command (in the File menu) to save it.  If not, look in your browser's Downloads folder for the image file.<br />
	<table>
	  <tr>

        </p>
        
        <h4><strong>Exporting All the Images at Once</strong></h4>
        <p>
        	You can download an HTML file of all of the blocks in your whole project as well as a picture of the stage by selecting "Export summary..." from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button" title="File button"/>). The HTML file also land in your browser's Downloads folder. Open it (in a browser), right-click (or control-click on a mac) to copy the images you need, and paste them into the document where you are describing your code.<br />

        </p>
                
        <h3>Describing Abstraction and Algorithm for the AP Create Task</h3>
        <p>You've been creating algorithms and using abstraction all year. All you need to know for the AP test is how to <em>call attention to</em> and <em>describe</em> what you've done.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>Algorithm</strong></h4>
        <p>
        	In Unit 1, you created an algorithm for drawing this pinwheel shape:<br />
            <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/pinwheel-shape.png" alt="image of pinwheel drawn in Snap!" title="image of pinwheel drawn in Snap!" />
        </p>
		<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/algorithm-without-abstraction.png" alt="the three blocks 'move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise (45) degrees' repeated 8 times" title="the three blocks 'move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise (45) degrees' repeated 8 times" />
        <p>The shape consists of eight line segments, each the same length. The first segment is 100 steps long. To prepare for the next segment, the sprite backs up 70 steps along the first segment and turns 45 degrees to the right. Each new line segment follows the same pattern: <code>move 100</code>, <code>move -70</code>, <code>turn 45</code>. It could be written using eight sets of those three blocks (as shown at right). That is the algorithm, but it's hard to read. For one thing, it's hard to tell whether all the blocks are there. Using <code>repeat</code> makes the algorithm clearer, briefer, and easier to read. This is how the algorithm is now expressed:<br />
          <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/algorithm-with-repeat.png" alt="repeat (8) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise (45) degrees}" title="repeat (8) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise (45) degrees}" />
    	</p>
        <div class="takeNote">Your program for the AP task will have different algorithms (<strong>stretches of code that accomplish a particular purpose</strong>), and you can point to any chunk of code like that in your program as an example of an algorithm.</div>
        
        <h4><strong>Abstraction</strong></h4>
        <p>The last step shown above, using <code>repeat</code> to clarify the structure is also a simple example of abstraction. It hides a lot of repetitive detail and shows the <em>structure</em> better. This type of abstraction is <em>not</em> what the AP Create Task is looking for though.</p>
        
        <p>
        	You used another abstraction as well. The way you actually wrote the algorithm in Unit 1 recognized that the 45&deg; turn was <span class="katex">\frac{1}{8}</span> of the total turning of 360&deg;. So you wrote the algorithm this way:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/algorithm-with-repeat-and-div.png" alt="repeat (8) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise ((360) / (8)) degrees}" title="repeat (8) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise ((360) / (8)) degrees}" />
        </p>
        <p>
        	Changing both eights to fives in that algorithm would create a pinwheel with 5 branches. Instead of changing the numbers each time you wanted a new pinwheel, you created a <em>block</em> that contained the algorithm and let you just input whatever number of branches you want:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/pinwheel-block-def.png" alt="pinwheel, branches: (number of branches): {repeat(number of branches) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise (360/number of branches) degrees}}" title="pinwheel, branches: (number of branches): {repeat(number of branches) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise (360/number of branches) degrees}}" />
        </p>
        <div class="takeNote">
			<p>This is the kind of example you need to show for the Create Task: <strong>a custom block used multiple times in your project</strong>. Loops <em>are</em> an example of abstraction, but the expectation for the Create Task is that you create and submit your <em>own</em> example of abstraction rather than just pointing out existing abstractions like loop blocks.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
        	The abstraction of <code>pinwheel</code> helps in three ways:
            <ol>
                <li>It saves you from having to change <em>two</em> numbers each time you use the code, which is prone to error (such as accidentally changing only one of them but not the other).</li>
                <li>
                    Instead of putting all this code<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/algorithm-with-repeat-and-div.png" alt="repeat (8) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise ((360) / (8)) degrees}" title="repeat (8) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise ((360) / (8)) degrees}" /><br />
                    in your program everywhere you want it to draw a pinwheel, you now need only<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/pinwheel.png" alt="pinwheel, branches: (8)" title="pinwheel, branches: (8)" />
                </li>
                <li>Your code is easier for someone else to read, because it now <em>says what it does</em>: it makes a pinwheel with 8 branches.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>When you create a block and give it a name that describes its purpose, you are creating an abstraction. You are <em>hiding the details</em> and showing only the purpose. When you use that pinwheel block, it shows the <em>structure</em> of your program more clearly. Someone reading your program doesn't need to figure out what the details inside <code>pinwheel</code> do; they can tell from the name that it makes a pinwheel with a given number of branches. <!--When you create a block with an input that lets it vary what it does, using the same algorithm, you are making it a more general-purpose block, and that is also a kind of abstraction.--></p>
                
        <div class="takeNote">
        	<p>Note that while packing your entire program into a single block might make the page cleaner, it is <em>not</em> a good example of abstraction. The best examples of abstraction to highlight for the AP are <strong>pieces of code that you use multiple times in your program and are clearer <em>because</em> they are packed into a well-named block</strong>. You can often use what's <em>in</em> that block as an example of the <em>algorithm</em> for the purpose that the block serves.</p>
        </div>
       <h4><strong>Gotchas</strong></h4>
		<p>You are encouraged by the College Board to <em>develop your program</em> in partnership with another student, which means planning it in the first place and then writing the code.  But <em>each partner must code at least one algorithm solo,</em> and <em>the video and answers to questions must be done individually.</em>

	<p>Definitely read the grading scale <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap19-sg-csp.pdf">from the College Board</a>.  (This link is to the 2019 grading instructions, but it's close enough.)  There are some grading issues that might not be obvious.  Here's one, about Response 2b:<br />
		<img src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/response-2b.png" /><br />
	They want you to show that you went through a process of <em>repeatedly</em> making changes in your code to fix bugs or add features.  The instructions for students say, "Describe the incremental and iterative development process of your program, 
focusing on two distinct points in that process."  What they mean is that you have to describe <em>two times</em> when you fixed or improved something, <em>not</em> two code pictures showing the before and after states of a single improvement.  Many students have lost these two points because of this misunderstanding.</p>

<p><strong>Responses 1 and 2a:</strong> You must make a one-minute <strong><em>video</em></strong> <em>showing</em> at least part of your project working.  What you submit has to be an actual movie of the user's interaction with the program, not just a sequence of non-moving screenshots.  You don't have to show every feature of the program, and it's best to focus on the algorithm that you wrote individually and will describe later in your response.  Along with the video, you need some explanation, which can be provided as speech recorded with your video, as open captions on the video, or on paper as response 2a  In your explanation, whatever form it takes, you must explain the overall goal of your project ("Our project is meant to teach a third-grader the times table").  You must also explain what your video is showing, and you must say that you used Snap<em>!</em> as the programming language.</p>

<p>If you use a <em>spoken</em> explanation, be extra careful to make the audio commentary in a silent place, not only without other people but also without noise from cars or trains outside; close all the windows during the recording.  (There's no point scored for the audio quality as such, but in past years some audio voiceovers have been so noisy that the graders couldn't make out what the student was saying, so the student lost points having to do with the two explanations listed above.)</p>

<p><strong>Response 2b:</strong> Note that your response has to <em>describe your process</em> of development: "First we listed the major components of the program and decided who would write what.  Then we wrote some code..." or however you actually did it.  As this example shows, you should describe how you and your partner worked both before and after you started coding, but deciding what to make as a project doesn't count.  The College Board wants to see that your process was <em>iterative,</em> which means that you went through several cycles of coding and testing, and <em>incremental,</em> which means that you solved one problem at a time.  It will make life easier for your Reader if you use the actual words "iterative" and "incremental" to flag the place(s) in your answer that specifically addresses these requirements.  Don't confuse <em>iterative development</em> with <em>iteration</em> (looping).</p>

<p>In describing <em>difficulties,</em> don't say "We didn't know how to do this" with "We asked our teacher" as the solution.  (For one thing, you're not allowed to get help from your teacher during this assignment.)  By "difficulty" they mean <em>a bug in your program,</em> and by <em>solving the difficulty</em> they mean the process of debugging.  Did you, for example, set breakpoints with the <code>pause all</code> block?  (There's no right answer to this, and you don't have to use every possible debugging aid.  Just honestly explain the steps you went through, and what you were thinking at each step in the debugging.)</p>

<p>An <em>opportunity</em> is some new feature you think about adding to your project.  If you use an opportunity as one of the two "difficulties or opportunities," then instead of explaining how you found and fixed a bug, you must explain how you added the feature: "We noticed that the program didn't let us choose the plus table instead of the times table, and decided to add a button to switch.  The code to display the button had to be added to the general redisplay module..." continuing down to the details of what procedure you modified and (presumably) what procedure you added.</p>

<p><strong>Response 2c:</strong> In this question you must focus on an algorithm that you wrote by yourself, not with your partner.  

They're fussy about what counts as an algorithm.  It can't be all user interface (you push a button and a light lights up); there has to be some real computation.  You have to explain <em>both</em> how the algorithm works taken in isolation <em>and</em> how this algorithm contributes to the overall program.  

Another requirement is that you show <em>complex algorithms,</em> which means that you wrote a procedure (a block) that calls at least two other procedures that <em>you wrote.</em>  (So that's a total of three algorithms you have to touch on.)

Don't forget to use the magic words <em>sequence, iteration,</em> and <em>conditionals</em> in your description.  The people at the College Board who wrote the grading rubric don't believe that composition of functions (including in implementing recursion) counts as part of a complex algorithm, so you might consider deliberately writing bad code in one procedure so that you can show them an iterative loop.  Your algorithms have to use <em>mathematical or logical</em> concepts, which basically means that you do arithmetic (e.g., with a <code>for</code> loop, in which case you say you're doing "implicit arithmetic") and you use conditionals (<code>if</code>).

You must explain how one of the two helper procedures works on its own; you might, for example, show some inputs and outputs, and also say how the helper procedure is used elsewhere in the project.</p>

Make sure the procedures you discuss aren't one-liners.  This is an explicit rule for the readers, another demonstration that the College Board doesn't believe in composition of functions.  You can use higher order functions, but they don't count as one of two sub-algorithms because they're provided for you.  The function that's used as input to the HOF can count, if you wrote it.

<p><strong>Response 2d:</strong> The abstraction has to be <em>something you wrote,</em> not, for instance, a HOF that was provided by Snap<em>!.</em>  It should be a procedure you wrote, or an abstract data type you created.  In the description, you have to say how the abstraction simplifies the rest of the program: "The <u>contact</u> abstract data type lets the rest of the program ask for the parts of a contact without having to know where they are within the contact."

<div class="todo">
  Thinking about adding this as a hinted read-for-more-info:
  <div class="endnote">
    <h4>Why don't they grade more sensibly?</h4>
    <p>In a world with very competitive college admission, full of parents with lawyers, it's very important to the College Board that scores be <em>reliable,</em> which means that you get the same score regardless of who grades your submission.  The week before the actual grading, they have training sessions in which graders read sample submissions from previous years, and must give the correct grades for each.  That kind of reliability is achievable for tiny yes-or-no questions such as "Are there two examples of refining the program?" but not achievable for broader questions such as "How well does the program work?" or "Does the program do something sensible?"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="todo">
      Really we should go through that table line by line, showing correct and incorrect answers.  I don't have the energy...
