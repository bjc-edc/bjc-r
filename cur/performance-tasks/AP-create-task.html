        <h3>Showing Your Code for the AP Create Task</h3>
        <p>Snap<em>!</em> has two convenient ways to share some or all of your code.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>Creating Script Pics</strong></h4>
        <p>
        	You can download a PNG image file of any block or script by right-clicking it (or control-clicking it on a mac) and selecting "script pic..." Look in your browser's Downloads folder for the image file.<br />
            <div class="sidenote">If you <em>shift</em>-right-click (or <em>shift</em>-control-click) on a <em>reporter</em> block, you will get a script pic of the reporter with it's report bubble showing.</div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/script-pic.png" alt="image of pinwheel block definition with right-click drop-down menu showing and mouse over 'script pic...' There is a balloon showing above the pointer that says, 'open a new window with a picture of this script'" title="image of pinwheel block definition with right-click drop-down menu showing and mouse over 'script pic...' There is a balloon showing above the pointer that says, 'open a new window with a picture of this script'" />
        </p>
        
        <h4><strong>Exporting All the Images at Once</strong></h4>
        <p>
        	You can download an HTML file of all of the blocks in your whole project as well as a picture of the stage by selecting "Export summary..." from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button" title="File button"/>). The HTML file also land in your browser's Downloads folder. Open it (in a browser), right-click (or control-click on a mac) to copy the images you need, and paste them into the document where you are describing your code.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/export-summary.png" alt="image of Snap! file menu open with mouse over 'Export summary...'

        <h3>Describing Abstraction and Algorithm for the AP Create Task</h3>
        <p>You've been creating algorithms and using abstraction all year. All you need to know for the AP test is how to <em>call attention to</em> and <em>describe</em> what you've done.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>Algorithm</strong></h4>
        <p>
        	In Unit 1, you created an algorithm for drawing this pinwheel shape:<br />
            <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/pinwheel-shape.png" alt="image of pinwheel drawn in Snap!" title="image of pinwheel drawn in Snap!" />
        </p>
		<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/algorithm-without-abstraction.png" alt="the three blocks 'move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise (45) degrees' repeated 8 times" title="the three blocks 'move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise (45) degrees' repeated 8 times" />
        <p>The shape consists of eight line segments, each the same length. The first segment is 100 steps long. To prepare for the next segment, the sprite backs up 70 steps along the first segment and turns 45 degrees to the right. Each new line segment follows the same pattern: <code>move 100</code>, <code>move -70</code>, <code>turn 45</code>. It could be written using eight sets of those three blocks (as shown at right). That is the algorithm, but it's hard to read. For one thing, it's hard to tell whether all the blocks are there. Using <code>repeat</code> makes the algorithm clearer, briefer, and easier to read. This is how the algorithm is now expressed:<br />
          <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/algorithm-with-repeat.png" alt="repeat (8) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise (45) degrees}" title="repeat (8) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise (45) degrees}" />
    	</p>
        <div class="takeNote">Your program for the AP task will have different algorithms (<strong>stretches of code that accomplish a particular purpose</strong>), and you can point to any chunk of code like that in your program as an example of an algorithm.</div>
        
        <h4><strong>Abstraction</strong></h4>
        <p>The last step shown above, using <code>repeat</code> to clarify the structure is also a simple example of abstraction. It hides a lot of repetitive detail and shows the <em>structure</em> better. This type of abstraction is <em>not</em> what the AP Create Task is looking for though.</p>
        
        <p>
        	You used another abstraction as well. The way you actually wrote the algorithm in Unit 1 recognized that the 45&deg; turn was <span class="katex">\frac{1}{8}</span> of the total turning of 360&deg;. So you wrote the algorithm this way:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/algorithm-with-repeat-and-div.png" alt="repeat (8) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise ((360) / (8)) degrees}" title="repeat (8) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise ((360) / (8)) degrees}" />
        </p>
        <p>
        	Changing both eights to fives in that algorithm would create a pinwheel with 5 branches. Instead of changing the numbers each time you wanted a new pinwheel, you created a <em>block</em> that contained the algorithm and let you just input whatever number of branches you want:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/pinwheel-block-def.png" alt="pinwheel, branches: (number of branches): {repeat(number of branches) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise (360/number of branches) degrees}}" title="pinwheel, branches: (number of branches): {repeat(number of branches) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise (360/number of branches) degrees}}" />
        </p>
        <div class="takeNote">
			<p>This is the kind of example you need to show for the Create Task: <strong>a custom block used multiple times in your project</strong>. Loops <em>are</em> an example of abstraction, but the expectation for the Create Task is that you create and submit your <em>own</em> example of abstraction rather than just pointing out existing abstractions like loop blocks.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
        	The abstraction of <code>pinwheel</code> helps in three ways:
            <ol>
                <li>It saves you from having to change <em>two</em> numbers each time you use the code, which is prone to error (such as accidentally changing only one of them but not the other).</li>
                <li>
                    Instead of putting all this code<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/algorithm-with-repeat-and-div.png" alt="repeat (8) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise ((360) / (8)) degrees}" title="repeat (8) {move (100) steps, move (-70) steps, turn clockwise ((360) / (8)) degrees}" /><br />
                    in your program everywhere you want it to draw a pinwheel, you now need only<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/pinwheel.png" alt="pinwheel, branches: (8)" title="pinwheel, branches: (8)" />
                </li>
                <li>Your code is easier for someone else to read, because it now <em>says what it does</em>: it makes a pinwheel with 8 branches.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>When you create a block and give it a name that describes its purpose, you are creating an abstraction. You are <em>hiding the details</em> and showing only the purpose. When you use that pinwheel block, it shows the <em>structure</em> of your program more clearly. Someone reading your program doesn't need to figure out what the details inside <code>pinwheel</code> do; they can tell from the name that it makes a pinwheel with a given number of branches. <!--When you create a block with an input that lets it vary what it does, using the same algorithm, you are making it a more general-purpose block, and that is also a kind of abstraction.--></p>
                
        <div class="takeNote">
        	<p>Note that while packing your entire program into a single block might the page cleaner, it is <em>not</em> a good example of abstraction. The best examples of abstraction to highlight for the AP are <strong>pieces of code that you use multiple times in your program and are clearer <em>because</em> they are packed into a well-named block</strong>. You can often use what's <em>in</em> that block as an example of the <em>algorithm</em> for the purpose that the block serves.</p>
