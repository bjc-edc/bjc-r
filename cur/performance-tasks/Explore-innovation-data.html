            1.2.5 Analyze the correctness, usability, functionality, and suitability of computational artifacts. [P4]<br />
            1.2.5A The context in which an artifact is used determines the correctness, usability, functionality, and suitability of the artifact.<br />
            1.2.5B A computational artifact may have weaknesses, mistakes, or errors depending on the type of artifact.<br />
            1.2.5C The functionality of a computational artifact may be related to how it is used or perceived.<br />
            1.2.5D The suitability (or appropriateness) of a computational artifact may be related to how it is used or perceived.<br />

		<h3>AP CSP Explore Task instructions:</h3>
<p>Identify the data that your chosen computing innovation uses. Explain how the innovation consumes, produces, <em>or</em> transforms that data. Identify one data storage, data privacy, <em>or</em> data security concern connected with the computing innovation.</p>
 
<p>You will <em>NOT</em> earn credit if your response
<ul>
	<li>does not state the <em>specific</em> kind of data (number, image, text, audio…) or just calls it “data”.</li>
	<li>confuses the innovation with its data.</li>
	<li>does not explain what happens to the data or how it is used.</li>
	<li>confuses the source of data (camera, thermal sensor…) with the data (image, temperature…).</li>
	<li>describes a concern that is <em>not</em> related to data.</li>
    </ul>
 </p>
<p>Below are three examples. Each is deliberately short to help you <em>structure</em> a good response. The examples use just one sentence to respond to the data questions; <em>you will need to write more</em>, using evidence as needed to support your claims.</p>
 
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<p>

<strong>Innovation:</strong> GPS (Global Positioning System)<br />
<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/explore-data/GPS_CC_Eduarda7.jpg"  width="250" alt="GPS (Creative Commons, Eduarda7)" title="GPS (Creative Commons, Eduarda7)"/>
<strong>Data:</strong><br />
<ul>
	<li><strong>Consumed Data:</strong> GPS receives signals from satellites orbiting the earth.</li>
	<li><strong>Produced Data:</strong> GPS computes your location on the globe (latitude and longitude); speed and direction of travel.</li>
	<li><strong>Transformed Data:</strong> Using a computational algorithm, satellite signal data is converted to location, speed and direction data.</li>
<strong>Data storage/privacy/security concern:</strong> If the GPS stores or sends location information, individuals or the government can track and monitor people via their phone GPS data.</li>
</ul>
 </p>
 <br />
 
<p><strong>Innovation:</strong> Google’s self-driving cars<br />
<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/explore-data/GoogleCar_CC_SteveJurvetson.jpg"  width="250" alt="Google Self-Driving Car (Creative commons, Steve Jurvetson)" title="Google Self-Driving Car (Creative commons, Steve Jurvetson)"/>
<strong>Data:</strong><br />
<ul>
<li>	<strong>Consumed Data:</strong> In order to navigate, cars use GPS data derived from satellite signals, map data that describe roads, and data from Google on traffic, road conditions and weather.</li>
<li>	<strong>Produced Data:</strong> In the process of self-driving, the cars gather and report back more data on traffic and road conditions; in the event of an accident, they generate crash data.</li>
<li>	<strong>Transformed Data:</strong> With the use of an algorithm, the input data (GPS, etc.) is converted to data for the operation of the car (speed, direction, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Data storage/privacy/security concern:</strong> Data can be hacked and used to track a car, cause a crash, hijack the car, etc.
 </p>
 <br />

<p><strong>Innovation:</strong> Autopilot Agricultural Drones<br />
<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/explore-data/FarmDrone_CC_ A.Savin.jpg" width="250"  alt="Farm Autopilot Drone (Creative commons, A.Savin)" title="Farm Autopilot Drone (Creative commons, A.Savin)"/>
<strong>Data:</strong><br />
<ul>
<li>	<strong>Consumed Data:</strong> To navigate, drones use GPS data that it derives from satellite signals, as well as data from their accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, pressure sensors.</li>
<li>	<strong>Produced Data:</strong> Drones produce high-resolution infrared and visual image data of the crops to reveal irrigation problems, pest infestation, etc.</li>
<li>	<strong>Transformed Data:</strong> Input data (from GPS, sensors, etc.) are transformed to data for the auto-piloting of the drone to maintain certain altitude, direction and speed.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Data storage/privacy/security concern:</strong> Farmer’s data can be stolen or altered by individuals or groups. That could be used to manipulate crop prices and commodity stock futures.
