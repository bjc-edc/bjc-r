        <h2>Evaluating Your Work</h2>
		<div class="todo">TG: Hand out the rubric.</div>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will look back through all the components of your Create Task to make sure you've met all the requirements, learn how to continue to prepare for the written portion of the AP exam, and celebrate your accomplishment!</p>
        </div>

        <p>When you are working on the practice Create Task, take advantage of the fact that you can talk to your teacher and classmates. On the official Create Task, you won't be able to ask your teacher for any help, and your partner can only help with the programming part.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>When you are finished with your program, video, Personalized Project Reference, and practice written responses, take a step back and carefully compare what you've done against the requirements listed in the <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf" target="_blank" title="AP CSP Student Handouts">AP Student Handouts</a> and any rubrics provided for the written portion. Don't be hopeful that you'll get points for something; be attentive to detail: are you <em>definitely</em> sure that you'll get credit for <em>every</em> single part? Make any changes needed to any part of your work until you are confident you'd get full credit.</li>
                <li>If you are on the practice Create Task, ask a classmate or your teacher to review your work and to help you consider what you might still need to do differently to receive full credit.  If someone asks you to review their practice Task, be attentive to detail; you aren't doing your friend a favor if you don't point out a problem because you don't want to hurt their feelings.  You can be both truthful and gentle.</li>
                <li>There is time between when you submit the final draft of your program, video, and Personalized Project Reference and the written AP exam. To help you prepare for the written portion (the last 60 minutes of the exam), you can practice answering more sample questions from the released practice exams. You should also be able to answer questions about your program such as:
                <ol>
                    <li>Describe the overall purpose of the program.</li>
                    <li>Describe the functionality of your program that is demonstrated in your video.</li>
                    <li>Describe the input and output of your program that is demonstrated in your video.</li>
                    <li>Describe what the data contained in the list on your Personalized Project Reference represents in your program.</li>
                    <li>Explain how the list on your Personalized Project Reference manages complexity in your program code by explaining why your program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, if you did not use the list.</li>
                    <li>Describe what the procedure on your Personalized Project Reference does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of your program.</li>
                    <li>Explain in detail how the algorithm implemented in the procedure on your Personalized Project Reference works. Your explanation must be detailed enough for someone else to recreate it.</li>
                    <li>Describe what condition is being tested when your procedure is called (by the code you included on your Personalized Project Reference). Identify the result of this call.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
				<li>Celebrate when you finish! Taking an AP course takes a lot of effort. Do something special to reward yourself for how hard you've worked!</li>
			</ol>
