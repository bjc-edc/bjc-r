        <h2>Using a Development Process to Organize Your Coding</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>In the Practice Create Task,</strong> you will become familiar with the guidelines and vocabulary of the AP Create Task, and practice performing the Create Task  with guidance and feedback from your teacher.</p>
            <p><strong>When you complete the actual Create Task,</strong> you will not be able to get guidance and feedback from your teacher.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will reflect on your coding habits and plan the development process you will use for the Create Task.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The Create Task is a chance for you to submit something to the College Board for inclusion in your AP CSP score that is creative: a program you design (with or without a partner), a video of the program running (developed on your own), and a written response about your program and your development process (written on your own).</p>
        
        <div class="comment">CRD-2.E.1, CRD-2.E.2</div>
        <p>
            The process you use to develop your program might be organized and strategic or it might be a process of exploration. There are different ways to program. Here are some common phases that a programmer goes through:
            <ul>
                <div class="comment">CRD-2.F.1</div>
                <li>investigating and reflecting&mdash; figuring out the requirements: what the user wants the program to do</li>
                <li>designing&mdash;planning what the app will look like to the user and the general approach you will use to code it</li>
                <li>prototyping&mdash;building a draft of the program</li>
                <li>testing&mdash;trying it out, sharing it with others for feedback, fixing any bugs, and making any needed improvements</li>
            </ul>
        </p>    
    
        <div class="comment">CRD-2.E.3, CRD-2.E.4</div>
        <p>Your development process might be <em>iterative</em> (involving several cycles of development and then testing and feedback) and/or it may be <em>incremental</em> (meaning that you build and test smaller pieces of the project before combining them).</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
				<li>Think about how you code. Do you tend to code iteratively (coding and then testing and then coding again, etc.)? Do you tend to code incrementally (building and perfecting one piece at a time? <!--What do you tend to think about before you start programming? Do you think about what the app will do and what features it will have or do you just start coding? Do you think about how you might program certain parts (such as "I'll need a <code>repeat</code> block for that")?--> Are there any development problems you've run into over and over? Are there any ways you might change your development process to avoid those challenges?</li>
                <div class="comment">CRD-2.E: Develop a program using a development process.</div>		
				<li>Before you begin your Create Task, decide what kind of development process you'll use. Write down your plan. It's ok if you change the plan as you go, but keep track of your changes too so you can write about them for the written response you'll have to submit.</li>
			</ol>
