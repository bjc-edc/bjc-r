        <h2>Using a Development Process to Organize Your Coding</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>In the Practice Create Task,</strong> you will become familiar with the guidelines and vocabulary of the AP Create Task, and practice performing the Create Task with guidance and feedback from your teacher.</p>
            <p><strong>When you complete the actual Create Task,</strong> you will not be able to get guidance and feedback from your teacher.</p>
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will reflect on your coding habits and plan the development process you will use for the Create Task.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The Create Task is a chance for you to submit something to the College Board for inclusion in your AP CSP score that is creative: a program you design (with or without a partner), a video of the program running (developed on your own), segments of your code on a Personal Project Reference sheet (developed on your own), and written responses about your program and your development process (written during the AP exam).</p>

        <div class="ap-standard">CRD-2.E.1, CRD-2.E.2</div>
        <p>
            The process you use to develop your program might be organized and strategic or it might be a process of exploration. There are different ways to program. Here are some common phases of development that a programmer goes through:
            <ul>
                <div class="ap-standard">CRD-2.F.1</div>
                <li>Investigating and reflecting&mdash;figuring out the requirements(what the user will want the program to do)</li>
                <li>Designing&mdash;planning what the app will look like to the user and the general approach you will use to code it</li>
                <li>Prototyping&mdash;building a draft of the program</li>
                <li>Testing&mdash;trying out your prototype, sharing it with others for feedback, fixing any bugs, and making any needed improvements</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <div class="ap-standard">CRD-2.E.3, CRD-2.E.4</div>
        <p>Your development process might be <em>iterative</em> (involving several cycles of development and then testing and feedback) and/or it may be <em>incremental</em> (meaning that you build and test smaller pieces of the project before combining them).</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
				<li>Think about how you code. Do you tend to code <em>iteratively</em> (coding and then testing and then coding again, etc.)? Do you tend to code <em>incrementally</em> (building and perfecting one piece at a time)? Are there any development problems you've run into over and over? Are there any ways you might change your development process to avoid those challenges?</li>
                <div class="ap-standard">CRD-2.E: Develop a program using a development process.</div>
				<li>Before you begin your Create Task, decide what kind of development process you'll use (iterative and/or incremental). Write down your plan. It's OK if you change the plan as you go, but keep track of any changes to your plan.</li>
			</ol>
