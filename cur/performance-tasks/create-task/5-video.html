            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will reread the Create Task guidelines and develop your video.</p>

        <div class="takeNote">Until this point you may have been programming with a partner. For the video, the Personalized Project Reference, and the written responses on the AP exam, you will have to work alone.</div>

				<li>Once you have completed your program, reread the guidelines. Make sure your program code (Component A) fulfills all the requirements, then focus on the requirements for Component B (the video) and Component C (the Personalized Project Reference). Discuss any questions you have with your classmates or teacher.</li>
                <li>Decide how you are going to create your video and learn to use the technology well enough that you are comfortable doing it alone. </li>
                <div class="ap-standard">CRD-2.B.5</div>
                <li>Make your video according to the guidelines: show what input your program takes, what it does, and what it outputs. You can't include any audio, but it will help the grader see how you've met the guidelines if you include some text captions. Your video must be less than a minute long and meet the format and size requirements.</li>
