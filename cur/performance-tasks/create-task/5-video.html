				<li>Once you have completed your program, reread the Create Task guidelines. Make sure your program code (Component A) fulfills all the requirements, then focus on the requirements for Component B (the video) and Component C (the Personalized Project Reference).

                <li>Decide how you are going to create your video and learn to use the technology well enough that you are comfortable doing it alone. </li>
