        <h2>Testing Your Project</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will reflect on your specifications to design a testing plan, and then you'll run the tests and fix any errors.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="comment">CRD-2.J.1, CRD-2.J.2, CRD-2.J.3</div>
        <p>After you develop a prototype, you'll need to test it and revise it based on the results. But testing is more than "just playing with the program as a user." Good testing is systematic, and it requires referring back to the program requirements to identify a variety of inputs to test different possibilities for user behavior (including extreme cases, such as very long words, very small numbers, very fast clicks, etc.) and the expected outcomes for these inputs.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<div class="comment">CRD-2.J</div>
                <li>Looking back at your specifications, identify: the types of inputs your program takes, a variety of different and extreme cases for these inputs, and the expected outcomes for each case. Record these testing inputs and their expected outcomes.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
        <p>
            What you'll need to do to fix errors in your program depends on what type of error occurs:
            <div class="vocabFullWidth">
                <div class="comment">CRD-2.I.1, CRD-2.I.2, CRD-2.I.3, CRD-2.I.4</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>logic error</strong> causes the program to produce the wrong output. (This is the most common error in Snap<em>!</em>)</li>
                    <li>A <strong>syntax error</strong> means the rules of the programming language were not followed. (These are more common in text-based languages because you can easily mistype something or forget a needed semi-colon or quotation mark.  By comparison, Snap<em>!</em> doesn't let you drop a block where it doesn't belong.)</li>
                    <li>A <strong>run-time error</strong> an error that happens while your program is running. What counts as a run-time error depends on the program you are using; in Snap<em>!</em> these are the errors that stop your program with a red halo surrounding the block that caused the error.</li>
                    <li>An <strong>overflow error</strong> happens when a number is too extreme for the computer to handle (too big or too small).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </p>
        <div class="comment">CRD-2.I.5</div>
        <p>
            There are many ways to find and correct errors. Here are several common onces:
            <ul>
                <li>Test Cases&mdash;identifying extreme input cases to test and their expected outcomes (This is the primary method you'll be using.)</li>
                <li>Hand tracing&mdash;reading the code <em>by hand</em> and testing various cases as though you were the computer</li>
                <li>Visualizations&mdash;creating a visual way to see what your program is doing (such as a variable watcher, or a chart of inputs, expected outcomes, and actual outcomes)</li>
                <li>Debuggers&mdash;some programming languages include a debugging feature that will help you locate and understand errors (such as Visible Stepping in Snap<i>!</i>)</li>
                <li>Adding Output(s)&mdash;you can add <code>say</code> blocks to your code or add temporary variable watchers to help you understand what values are held by your program at different times (this is another great strategy in Snap<em>!</em>)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<div class="comment">CRD-2.I parts a and b</div>
                <li>Test for errors in your program. Try out the inputs you have selected and record their outcomes. Were there any discrepancies between what you expected and what happened? Resolve any problems and test again. </li>
			</ol>
