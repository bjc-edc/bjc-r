        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will reread the Create Task guidelines and then develop your video and written response.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="takeNote">Until this point you may have been programming with a partner. For the video and the written portion of the Create Task, you will have to work alone.</div>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Once you have completed your program, reread the guidelines, focusing on the video and the written response. Discuss any questions you have with your classmates or teacher.</li>
                <li>If you are working on the practice Create Task, decide how you are going to create your video and learn to use the technology well enough that you are comfortable doing it along. That way, when you complete the official Create Task, you don't have to think about how to make the video; you can just focus on making it meet the guidelines. </li>

                <li>Develop your video to show what input the program takes, what it does, and what it outputs. You can't include any audio, but it will help the grader see how you've met the guidelines if you include some text.</li>

                <li>Develop your written response to describe:

                        <li>The purpose of your program</li>
                        <li>What your video shows</li>

                    <h4><strong>Showing Your Code</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Snap<em>!</em> has two convenient ways to get image files of some or all of your code:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <a href="#hint-script-pics" data-toggle="collapse" title="Creating Script Pics"><strong>Creating Script Pics</strong></a>

                                    <p>
                                        You can download a PNG image file of any block or script by right-clicking it (or control-clicking it on a Mac) and selecting "script pic..." Look in your browser's Downloads folder for the image file.<br />
                                        <div class="sidenote">If you <em>shift</em>-right-click (or <em>shift</em>-control-click) on a <em>reporter</em> block, you can get a script pic of the reporter with its report bubble showing.</div>

                                </div>

                                    <p>
                                        You can download an HTML file of all of the blocks in your whole project as well as a picture of the stage by selecting "Export summary..." from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button" title="File button"/>). The HTML file also lands in your browser's Downloads folder. Open it (in a browser), right-click (or control-click on a Mac) to copy the images you need, and paste them into the document where you are describing your code.<br />
