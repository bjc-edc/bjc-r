        <h2>Writing About Your Project</h2>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will practice writing about your project in preparation for the AP exam.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="takeNote">
			<p>The written portion of the Create Task will be done during the AP exam after the multiple choice questions. You can only use the College Board provided exam reference sheet and your Personalized Project Reference sheet (Component C) during this portion of the exam.</p>
			<p>You will get four questions, one in each of these areas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Your program's design, function, and purpose</strong>&mdash;describing who it is for, what it does, how it works, how you made it, and/or what are the inputs and outputs</li>
				<li><strong>Algorithm development</strong>&mdash;explaining your algorithms, how they work (including operators and/or conditionals), and/or describing what would happen if you changed them</li>
				<li><strong>Errors and testing</strong>&mdash;knowing what would lead to an error and how you would test for that kind of error and/or fix it (go back to page 4, Testing, for helpful terms and techniques)</li>
				<li><strong>Data and procedural abstraction</strong>&mdash;understanding how lists and/or procedures and manage complexity in your program, which may include questions about data abstraction and/or list traversal</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<p>The exact four questions you have to answer will be different on the exam. Here are some <em>sample</em> prompts provided by the College Board to help you practice writing about your project. These four questions correspond to each of the areas above.</p>
			<ol>
                <li>Identify an expected user of your program. Describe one way your program's design meets the needs of this user.</li>
				<li>Consider the first iteration statement included in the Procedure section of your Personalized Project Reference. Identify the number of times the body of your iteration statement will execute. Describe a condition or error that would cause your iteration statement to not terminate and cause an infinite loop. If no such condition or error exists, explain how the loop could be modified to cause an infinite loop.</li>
				<li>Consider the procedure included in part (i) of the Procedure section of your Personalized Project Reference. Describe a change to your procedure that will result in a run-time error. Explain why this change will result in a run-time error.</li>
				<li>Suppose you are provided with a procedure called <div class="pre-container"><pre class="inline">isEqual (value1, value2)</pre></div>. The procedure returns <div class="pre-container"><pre class="inline">true</pre></div> if the two parameters <div class="pre-container"><pre class="inline">value1</pre></div> and <div class="pre-container"><pre class="inline">value2</pre></div> are equal in value and returns <div class="pre-container"><pre class="inline">false</pre></div> otherwise. Using the list you identified in the List section of your Personalized Project Reference, explain in detailed steps an algorithm that uses <div class="pre-container"><pre class="inline">isEqual</pre></div> to count the number of times a certain value appears in your list. Your explanation must be detailed enough for someone else to write the program code.</li>
			</ol>
