        <h2>Evaluating Your Work</h2>
		<div class="todo">TG: Hand out the rubric.</div>
        <div class="learn">
            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will use the rubric to evaluate your program, video, and written response, and you will make any necessary adjustments.</p>
        </div>

        <p>When you are working on the practice Create Task, take advantage of the fact that you can talk to your teacher and classmates. On the official Create Task, you won't be able to ask your teacher for any help, and your partner can only help with the programming part.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>When you are finished with your program, video, and written response, take a step back and carefully compare it against the grading rubric. Don't be hopeful that you'll get points for something; be ruthless: are you <em>definitely</em> sure that you'll get credit for <em>every</em> single part? Make any changes needed to any part of your work until you are confident you'd get full credit.</li>
                <li>If you are on the practice Create Task, ask a classmate or your teacher to review your work and to help you consider what you might still need to do differently to receive full credit.  If someone asks you to review their practice Task, be ruthless; you aren't doing your friend a favor if you don't point out a problem because you don't want to hurt their feelings.  You can be both truthful and gentle.</li>
				<li>Celebrate when you finish! Taking an AP course takes a lot of effort. Do something special to reward yourself for how hard you've worked!</li>
