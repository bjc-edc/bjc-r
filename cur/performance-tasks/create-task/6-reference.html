		<h2>Preparing Your Personalized Project Reference</h2>
		<div class="learn">
			<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop a Personalized Project Reference sheet based on your Snap<em>!</em> project for use on the AP exam.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="takeNote">
			<p>
				There are two different places you will submit images of your code to the College Board: 
				<ul>
					<li>For Component A (program code), you will submit an image of <em>all</em> of your code, including comments and citations.</li>
					<li>For Component C (Personalized Project Reference), you will submit images of <em>specific portions</em> of your code and you cannot have any comments.</li>
				</ul>
				During the written response portion on the AP exam, you can <em>only</em> use what is on your Personalized Project Reference sheet.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>
					Follow the guidelines provided by the College Board to identify two <em>procedure</em> code segments and two <em>list</em> code segments in your project. Here is a review of the guidelines, but always confirm with the College Board requirements:
					<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
						<li>
							The two <strong>procedure</strong> code segments must show:
							<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
								<li>A student-developed procedure showing the procedure name, type of data returned by the procedure if any (such as number, text, list, etc.), procedure input or inputs and their use, and the algorithm inside the procedure that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. </li>
								<li>A section of your program that calls that procedure.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							The two <strong>list</strong> code segments must show:
							<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
								<li>A section of your program that shows how data have been stored in a list and what that list is called.</li>
								<li>A section of your program that shows how the data in that same list is used towards the program's purpose.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Make your Personalized Project Reference sheet with the four code segments that you identified above. 
					<div class="takeNote">During the AP exam, your school will provide a printout of your Personalized Project Reference sheet for you to use on the exam. For the Practice Create Task, if you find that you cannot answer some of the writing prompts on the next page (Writing About Your Project) using only the four code segments you selected, then you can revise your Personalized Project Reference sheet. On the actual AP exam, you <em>won't be able to revise your Personalized Project Reference</em>, so use the Practice Create Task to think about what makes a good code segment to include on your Personalized Project Reference. On the official Create Task, when you create your Personalized Project Reference sheet for the AP exam, think in advance of how well you'll be able to respond to the prompts on the next page.</li>

                    <p>
                        Snap<em>!</em> has two convenient ways to get image files of some or all of your code:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <a href="#hint-script-pics" data-toggle="collapse" title="Creating Script Pics"><strong>Creating Script Pics</strong></a>

                                        You can download a PNG image file of any block or script by right-clicking it (or control-clicking it on a Mac) and selecting "script pic..." Look in your browser's Downloads folder for the image file.<br />
                                        <div class="sidenote">If you <em>shift</em>-right-click (or <em>shift</em>-control-click) on a <em>reporter</em> block, you can get a script pic of the reporter with its report bubble showing.</div>

                                        You can download an HTML file of all of the blocks in your whole project as well as a picture of the stage by selecting "Export summary..." from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height:1.6em;" alt="File button" title="File button"/>). The HTML file also lands in your browser's Downloads folder. Open it (in a browser), right-click (or control-click on a Mac) to copy the images you need, and paste them into the document where you are describing your code.<br />
