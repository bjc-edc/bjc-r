            <p><strong>Why this? Why here?</strong></p>
            <p>From the Teacher Survey Feedback Analysis: "Teachers expressed that students were struggling with the suitability of a topic and the requirements of the data. Specifically, these concerns included being able to think about the broader construct of society instead of an individual, relating concept of data to ideas, and finding resources to answer each part of the task."</p>
            <p>Also from the Teacher Survey Feedback Analysis: "In terms of preparation, teachers want a better understanding of what counts as data (examples and counterexamples), a list of topics, help knowing if the innovation is the right kind, and additional resources (structured smaller projects, a graphic organize, videos with explanations) and practice questions that lead up to the type of questions on AP task)."</p>
            <p>Actual teacher feedback: "I need more support in understanding what data is acceptable and what is not (more examples and counterexamples) as well as with data, security and privacy concerns."</p>

            <ul>
                <li>It's longer than I'd intended, so I'm open to dropping things that don't look useful.</li>
                <li>We need to be careful not to become the student's Explore Task home base. We are a support for this. The College Board website should be the home base. Please consider this as you review.</li>
                <li>We need to be careful not to say anything that could mislead students in any way about the requirements. Better to support less than to be wrong. Again, please be mindful of this in your review.</li>
                <li>I have mixed feelings about using FYTD on this page, but I went with it because I think it sets up the mindset of "this is something I have to do," which gives us some control over getting the students to actually review their own work for how well it meets the requirements. Perhaps this conflicts with "not becoming the home base" and they should be made white-text or removed. Thoughts?</li>

        <h3>Choosing an Innovation</h3>
        <div class="sidenote">Note: We added the apostrophe to this quote.</div>
		<p>
            The College Board Explore Task directions (linked above) ask you to "<strong>analyze a computing innovation's impact on society, economy, or culture and explain how this impact could be beneficial and/or harmful</strong>." When you are thinking about innovations that you might use for your own submission, reflect on how well you'll be able to use that innovation to complete the Explore Task Directions. Consider:
        	<ul>
                <li>Is this actually a computing innovation? <div class="endnote">For example, near field communication isn't a computing innovation; it's a standard that supports communication between computing innovations.</div></li>
                <li>Can you describe the primary purpose of the technology? What was it designed to do? </li>
                <li>Can you identify <strong>both positive and negative</strong> impacts of this innovation on society, economy, or culture (not just individuals)? <div class="endnote">For example, it's not enough to say "it will make people less social." You'd need to describe the impact on society. What would change in our culture? For example, email has allowed people all over the world to send messages almost instantly, but since people aren't buying as many stamps, the public postal service (in the U.S. and other countries) is collapsing, which means that people who do need to mail something will have to use a private service.</div></li>
                <li>Can you identify how the innovation uses data? See also the "Describing How Your Innovation Uses Data" section below.</li>
                <li>Are you able to find information about "data storage, data privacy, or data security concerns" related to this innovation?</li>
			</ul>
        </p>
		<p>The Explore Task directions ask you to "<strong>produce a computational artifact</strong>" that explains the "<strong>computing innovationâ€™s intended purpose, its function, or its effect</strong>". This could be a video, an recording, or a PDF of a text document or slide show.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>Before you get begin working on your artifact, be sure that the innovation you use will work well for the task. Can you clearly answer each of the questions above?</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	
		<h3>Researching Your Topic</h3>
        <p>
            You learned about search engines in Unit 4 Lab 4, but you may not know that you can use <em>Boolean operators</em> to make your searches more specific.
			<div class="commentBig">EK 7.5.1B Advanced search tools, Boolean logic, and key words can refine the search focus and/or limit search results based on a variety of factors (e.g., peer-review status, type of publication.</div>
            <div class="sidenote">See <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433" title="Google Search Help: Refine web searches" target="_blank">Google Search Help: Refine web searches</a> for more ways to make your searches more precise.</div>
            <ul>
                <li>You can use <code>OR</code> (in capital letters) to find either search term. It works just like in Snap<em>!</em>. For example, typing <code>phones OR tablets</code> will give you all the pages that include either the word "phones" or the word "tablets."</li>
                <li>You can use <code>-</code> at the beginning of a word just like <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/not.png" alt="not" title="not" /> in Snap<em>!</em>. For example, typing <code>phones OR tablets -apple</code> will give you all the pages about either phones or tablets that do not have the word "apple" on them.</li>
            </ul>
        	<div class="commentBig">EK 7.5.2B Information from a source is considered relevant when it supports an appropriate claim or the purpose of the investigation.</div>
            Choose sources that are related to the goals of the explore task (describing the positive and/or negative impacts on humanity, how the innovation uses data, etc.).
        </p>
        <div class="commentBig">EK 7.5.2A Determining the credibility of a source requires considering and evaluating the reputation and credentials of the author(s), publisher(s), site owner(s), and/or sponsor(s).</div>
        <p>Anybody can post anything online, even if it isn't true. So <em>whenever</em> you are reading something online, you have to think about who is saying it and decide for yourself whether they know what they are talking about and you should use them to back up your work. In addition to considering what they say (does it make sense? is it well-written?), you might consider the reputation and achievements of the author, the publisher, the website, and/or the funder to help you decide.</p>
        <div class="endnote">For example, who wrote BJC? (Look at the very bottom of the page.) Who supported it financially? Do you trust these organizations? How could you check whether the information at the bottom of the page is true?</div>
        
        <h3>Describing How Your Innovation Uses Data</h3>
		<p>The Explore Task directions ask you to "<strong>explain how a computing innovation consumes, produces, or transforms data</strong>." You only need to do <em>one</em> of these for your innovation.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <p>
                After you have drafted your response to the Explore Task, take time to make sure you are addressing the data explanation completely:
                <ol start="3">
                    <div class="comment">Brian or others, looking at this, can you please ruthlessly critique the 3 examples (GPS, Self-driving cars, Agricultural drones)? I'm not sure we are being specific enough... --MF, 3/1/18</div>
                    <li>
                        Reread the <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles" title="AP CSP Assessment Overview and Performance Task Directions for Students" target="_blank">directions</a>, and check your work against them carefully.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Make sure that your response is clear about the <em>specific</em> kind of data that you are describing (numbers, images, text, audio, etc.). Don't just call it "data." What <em>kind</em> of data is it?</li>
                            <li>Make sure you don't to mix up the data with the innovation (for example, by describing GPS as data; GPS is an technology that <em>uses</em> data) or with the part of the innovation that collects the data (for example, the camera, heat sensor, etc.; those aren't the data; the images or temperature values are).</li>
                            <li>Make sure you describe <em>how the data is used</em>. You can describe how it collects data, the data it produces, or how it changes data.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
        	 Here are some examples of <em>how innovations use data</em>:
            <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/explore-data/FarmDrone_CC_ A.Savin.jpg" width="250"  alt="Farm Autopilot Drone (Creative commons, A.Savin)" title="Farm Autopilot Drone (Creative commons, A.Savin)"/>
			<ul>
                <li>GPS (Global Positioning System) consumes distances to satellites orbiting the earth and transforms that data to compute your location (latitude and longitude), speed, and direction of travel.</li>
                <li>Self-driving cars consume GPS data, maps, traffic data, and weather data. They produce more data on traffic and road conditions and, in event of an accident, they generate crash data (such as what speed the car was traveling and images from on-board cameras).</li>
                <li>Agricultural drones use GPS data together with data from their accelerometers (that measure changes in speed), gyroscopes (that measure orientation), cameras, and pressure sensors to produce images of crops in order to find irrigation problems, pest infestation, etc.</li>
			</ul>
        </p>
		<div class="endnote">These brief examples are based on the example Explore Task submissions on the College Board website. You can view the complete examples, see their scores, and read commentary on how they were graded on the <a href="http://pcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/exam/exam_information/231726.html" title="AP CSP: The Exam" target="_blank">AP CSP: The Exam</a> page.</div>
        
        <h3>Describing Concerns about Data</h3>
        <p>The College Board Explore Task directions ask you to "<strong>describe how data storage, data privacy, or data security concerns are raised based on the capabilities of the computing innovation</strong>."</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>
                    Make sure that the concern you describe is <em>actually related to the data</em>.
                    <div class="endnote">For example, a data-related concern about self-driving cars would be having the location data hacked so the driver can be tracked in their travels. A non-data-related concern about the same topic would be how self-driving cars would put people who drive for a living out of work and increase unemployment; that could count as a harmful impact on society but not as a concern involving the data.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure that the concern is real. With new technologies, people get concerned about all kinds of things that can't really happen. Be sure your describe a concern that's actually legitimate.
                      <div class="endnote">For example, people worry about self-driving cars being hacked and being made to drive wherever the hacker wants, but self-driving cars aren't taking instructions from somewhere else. They can be foiled in other ways but not that way.</div>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Citing Your Sources</h3>
		<div class="commentBig">EK 7.5.1C Plagiarism is a serious offense that occurs when a person presents another's ideas or words as his or her own. Plagiarism may be avoided by accurately acknowledging sources.</div>
        <p>Whenever you do research, you need to cite the sources of your research. This helps readers know where to go for more information and how much of what you say is your own thinking vs. someone else's (neither is better, but it's important to be clear what is what).</p>
        <p>
            There are two basic ways to use sources:
			<ul>
                <li>You can use quotes from your sources, in which case you have to copy the text <em>exactly</em> and use quotation marks around the copied text.</li>
                <li>Or you can describe what you learned from your sources in your own words, in which case you don't need quotation marks and can't copy the text exactly.</li>
			</ul>
            <em>Either way</em>, you need to cite your sources. This usually involves listing some combination of author, date, title, website address, etc. so your readers can find what you read. The College Board's directions have specific instructions for how to cite sources for the Explore Task.
			<div class="takeNote">The general rule is that you can copy up to 4 words in a row (which is useful for naming ideas like <em>self-driving car technology</em>), but <strong>if you copy more than 5 words, you need quotes</strong>.</div>
		</p>
		<p>As you've probably heard in school, <em>plagiarism</em> (copying someone else's ideas without giving them credit) is a serious offense, and you can avoid it by giving credit to the authors whose work you've read. This is similar to copyright issues with songs and movies; artists can't just copy someone else's art without following the rules for giving the other artist credit.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="6">
                <li>Go the <a href="http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/exam/exam_information/231726.html" title="AP CSP: The Exam" target="_blank">AP CSP: The Exam</a> website, and look at some of the Explore Task examples and the commentary on their scores. Then, use the scoring guidelines in the <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles" title="AP CSP Assessment Overview and Performance Task Directions for Students" target="_blank">directions</a> to grade own Explore Task. Change anything you think you need to in order to get full points.</li>
