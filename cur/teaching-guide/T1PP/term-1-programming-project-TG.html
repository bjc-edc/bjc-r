		<h2>Programming Project</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this project is to offer students an opportunity to be creative with the ideas they have been learning so far in this course and to prepare students for the requirements of the <a href="http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-performance-assessment.pdf" target="_blank">AP Create Task</a>. As a result, the structure of the task is rather rigid&mdash;particularly the submission requirements. However, the open-ended nature of the programming element still allows for significant creativity.</p>
        <p>There are a variety of project ideas offered for students on the first lab page. To foster creativity in your students, encourage students to make adaptation to the suggested projects or to design their own. <strong>This project should be a chance for students to experience the beauty and joy of computing.</strong></p> 
		

		<h3>Prepare:</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Review the requirements of the <a href="http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-performance-assessment.pdf" target="_blank">AP Create Task</a>.</li>

		<div class="sidenoteBig">
			<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>The requirements of the programs (demonstrating abstraction and algorithms), the submission requirements (a PDF and a video), and the written assignment prompts are all designed to preview the constraints of the AP Create Task. In the actual Create Task, students will be asked to meet each of these requirements both as a team and again individually.</li>
