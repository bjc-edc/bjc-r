		<h2>Lab 5: Big Data</h2>
		<p>This lab focuses on the remaining content of AP CSP Big Idea 3: Data. Students use existing online data visualization tools to identifying patterns in data and work collaboratively to draw conclusions and summarize their findings. Several AP-style self-check questions are included to help students extend their understanding to the type of questions likely to appear on the exam.</p> 
		

		<h3>Pacing</h3>
		<div>
			The 4 lab pages could be split across 2-5 days (<strong>75-190 minutes</strong>). Expected times to complete follow:
			<ul>
				<li>30-90 minutes (1-2 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/5-big-data/1-large-data-sets.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Analyzing U.S. Baby Names</a></li>

                                        <li>Can you think of any other ways the Baby Name Voyager data might be presented?</li>
                                        <li>What new information is gained from the Baby Name Voyager visualization that would otherwise be difficult to learn?</li>
                                        <li>What visualizations might be possible for a different type of large data set?</li>

                                    Discussion: How can you work with large data sets?
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Where is the information in large data sets stored? How is it accessed?</li>
                                        <li>In what ways is it especially difficult to work with large data sets?</li>
                                        <li>What large data sets might be part of a student's life?</li>

                                </li>
                                <li>Expect a wide variety of search results from the Baby Name Voyager, and look for opportunities for students to share interesting data with others. Of particular interest may be "fad" names that were popular in specific decades (Lisa, Jennifer), and other names that were popular long ago but are re-emerging (Emma).</li>
                                <li>The Baby Name Voyager site frequently becomes unresponsive if no result is found. When this happens, ask students to reload the page.</li>
                                <li>Some students may get frustrated by not finding their own name in the Baby Name Voyager. Point out to students that only a small percentage of all names are listed. A larger text file (available  <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/5-big-data/yob2014.txt">here</a>) contains all names for at least 5 births. You might check this file to see if your students' names are in it&mdash;or even challenge a student to create an app that tests names against this data.</li>
                                <li>You may want to draw some connections to prior units' social implications labs, since there have been discussions about large data sets, notably a discussion about privacy concerns in personally-identifiable information.</li>
                                <li>During this lab, keep a lookout for news reports that involve the analysis of large data sets, for appropriate Computing In The News material.</li>
