		<h2>Social Implications Lab 5: Search</h2>
		<p>At first, searching on the Internet may not seem to have many social implications. But as students learn about how search engines work, they might be surprised to learn what is included and, sometimes more importantly, excluded from the results. Students will also think about the information that search engines can collect about your searches, and the implications of how they might use that data.</p>
        <p>Students will also have the opportunity to begin to design their own search engine. In doing so, they examine their own values and priorities. They can ask questions like: How important is privacy to me? What sources of information might be overlooked by the engineers who design these search engines at large companies? What phrases have special meaning to me that Yahoo or Google don't seem to know about? This activity asks students to think more deeply about search engines, but also is meant to demonstrate that students have valuable contributions to make.</p>
		

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
        There are only 3 pages in this lab. The lab is expected to take less than a week, though this can change depending on how deeply students want to dive into designing their own search engine.
        <ul>
        	<li>40-50 minutes on Getting Started</li>
            <li>40-50 minutes on How Searching Works</li>
            <li>40-80 minutes on Design Your Own Search Engine</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h3>Prepare:</h3>
		<div>
            <ul>
				<li>As you do <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/openers.html#computingnews" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> with your students this week, you might also share with them the news sources you use and talk about how these sources are also affected by search criteria.</li>
                <li>Students will read parts of <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">Chapter 4 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a>. Reading through the entire chapter can help you bring up interesting points for students to consider during classroom discussions.
                <ul>
				<div class="sidenote">Students will learn more about the structure of the Internet in Unit 4.</div>
                	<li>For example, during discussions, you may get the sense that students are thinking about the organization of the Internet as a hierarchy, as in a library. Pages 117-120 can give you a way to talk about this idea with students.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If you're unfamiliar with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, you might take their tour and explore some of their features.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<h3>Students will:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Examine some different search engines.</li>
                <li>Guess at how search engines might work (perhaps surfacing some misconceptions that can be addressed).</li>
                <li>Read parts of <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">Chapter 4 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a> to learn how search engines actually work.</li>
                <li>Either suggest improvements to an existing search engine or design a specialized search engine of their own. They will see how bias and preferences can show up in search engines and will explore ways to express their own interests and values in their own design.</li>
			</ul>
