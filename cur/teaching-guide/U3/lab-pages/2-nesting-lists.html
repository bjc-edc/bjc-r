    	<h2>Programming Lab 2: Nesting Lists</h2>
        <p>A list of same-size lists forms a table, a two-dimensional array of data. Their ordered and nested indicies provide a logical structure for accessing information in the dataset. (In mathematics, lists appear as vectors and lists of lists as matrices.)</p>
        <p>, tables or arrays of data (in mathematics, vectors and matrices), and more.  The <code>list</code> is the basic building block of all those more complex structures.  A table of data, is a list of rows of data, each row being a list of data.</p>
        <p>Students create a contact list app that collects and stores phone numbers and names and can be cleared, and explore list reporters with nested lists. They use <code>for each</code> to process lists of points on the plane and lists of note pitches and durations in a melody. The points and notes are, themselves list of lists, (<var>{<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>}</var> and <var>{pitch, duration}</var>).</p>
        <p>abstract data types (ADTs)</p>
        <p>Thus in Labs 1 and 2, students have encountered lists of strings/words, numbers, and lists. They also use <em>abstraction</em> to clarify and simplify code, clarifying the role of a pair of numbers as the coordinates of a <code>point</code> (or the attributes of a <code>note</code>) not just as the elements of a <code>list</code>. </p> 
        Students 
        
        <p>Lists that appear as elements of another list are called "nested lists". For example if we  <code>item (3) of </code> the list below gives <var>list {10, 120}</var>. The point (10, 120) is the third that the sprite visits and is the first on the right hand (positive) side of the vertical axis. blocks can locate items in the lists in the list and also the just the lists within the list with all their items inside. Lists can go inside lists inside lists and so on, but Unit 3 only covers two-dimensions of nesting: lists of lists which form arrays.
         in <s>is a list that appears as an element in another list. In this list, the element with index 3 is a nested list. To extract an element from the nested list, we can proceed in two steps. First, extract the nested list, then extract the item of interest. It is also possible to combine those steps using bracket operators that evaluate from left to right.</s></p>
        
        <h3>Pacing:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>The four pages of this lab (<strong>Lists of Lists</strong>, <strong>The <code>For Each</code> Block</strong>, <strong>Data Types</strong>, and <strong>Lists Review and Self Check</strong>) are each expected to be relatively quick, approximately 1 class period each.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
				<li>Page 1, Lists of Lists, includes a new Contact List app that was not part of this curriculum until October 2015. Teachers should review and work though these pages. Feedback is always appreciated.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h3>Students will:</h3>
        <!--<div class="sidenoteBig">
        	<div><strong>Looking ahead</strong></div>
        	<ul>
			</ul>
		</div>-->
		<div>
			<ul>
                <li>Access and manipiulate data in lists of lists.</li>
                <li>Use the <code>for each</code> block to access each item of a list.</li>
                <li>Create abstract data types to organize and manage data.</li>
                <li>Use lists of lists together with date types to organize and access data for graphics and music scripts.</li>
            </ul>

		<h3>As a Class:</h3>
		<div>
        	<ul>
            	<li>
                	<strong>Page 1: Lists of Lists.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Discussion, you might ask:
                            <ol>
                                <li>What is a list of lists?</li>
                                <li>What kinds of things can you do with a list of lists?</li>
                                <li>Do the lists inside a list <em>need to</em> be the same size?</li>
                                <li>What can be done if the lists inside a list <em>are</em> the same size?</li>
		                        <li>In what other situations might a list of lists be helpful?</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>You might consider asking students (or pairs) to write a sentence for each of the list reporters decribing how they treat lists of lists. Or you could discuss this as a class as well.</li>
                    </ul>
            	</li>
                <li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Encourage students to read though the dialogue more than once: individually, in small groups, in front of the class, etc. </li>
                    </ul>
            	</li>
                <li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Encourage students to read though the dialogue more than once.</li>
                        <li>Discussion: After all students have read through the dialogue a few times (and perhaps also added the abstract data type to their U3L1-DrawShape project), you might review with questions like these:
                        	<ul>
		                        <li>What is the benefit of creating an abstract data type?</li>
		                        <li>In what other situations might abstract data types be helpful?</li>
                                <li>What kind of data types does a list take? Lists take any type of input (primative or abstract data types)</li>
		                        <li>What is a <em>primitive</em> data type? What are some examples?</li>
		                        <li>What is a <em>abstract</em> data type? What are some examples?</li>
                                <li>What is the difference between a primitive data type and an abstract data type?</li>
                                <li>How are abstract data types an example of abstraction?</li> 
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                	<strong>Page 4: Lists Review and Self Check.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consider inviting students with musical training to present basic music theory (especially classical note pitch and beat length representation) and to share and describe their music script(s) with the class.</li>
                        <li></li>
