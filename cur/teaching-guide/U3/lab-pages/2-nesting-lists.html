    	<h2>Programming Lab 2: Nesting Lists</h2>
        <p>Lists of similar datatypes  list  ists can be nested with logical structure to trees of information, tables or arrays of data (in mathematics, vectors and matricies), and more.  The <code>list</code> is the basic building block of all those more complex structures.  A table of data, for example, is a list of rows of data, each row being a list of data.</p>
        <p>Students also process lists of points on the plane and lists of notes in a melody. The points and notes are, themselves list of two numbers, in one case the list (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>), and in the other case the list (pitch, duration). Thus in Labs 1 and 2, students have encountered lists of strings/words, numbers, and lists. They also use <em>abstraction</em> to clarify and simplify code, clarifying the role of a pair of numbers as the coordinates of a <code>point</code> (or the attributes of a <code>note</code>) not just as the elements of a <code>list</code>. </p>

        	<div><strong>Looking ahead</strong></div>
        	<ul>
            	<li>Students are introduced to <code>map</code> in Getting Started, but don't have to fully understand it. They will work more with <code>map</code> in Lab 2.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<ul>
                <li>Continue to practice pair programming</li>
                <li>Begin to work with lists of lists</li>
                <li>Use the <code>for each</code>block to access each item of a list.</li>

		<h3>As a Class:</h3>
		<div>
        	<ul>
				<li>You may wish to have a class discussion regarding datatypes: strings vs. lists (also predicates, numbers, functions, etc.). You might ask:
                    <ol>
                        <li>What is a list?</li>
                        <li>What can you do with a list?</li>
                        <li>What kind of datatypes does a list take?</li>
                        <li>Can you put a list in a list?</li>
            		</ol>
    			</li>
    		</ul>
    	</div>

                <div class="todo">JK: Putting in these bullets to remind myself, in response to AC's comment that it's good to ask students to fix scripts becuase it demonstrates MP "something or other"</div>

                <li>Also include sample student responses for what partners are saying to each other about how sentence builder demonstrates abstraction</li>

		<h3>Tips:</h3>
		<div>
        	<ul>
                <li><div class="sidenote">Many of the <span class="snap">snap</span> projects linked from the student pages already have the tools imported.</div>Throughout this Unit, students will have to <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" /> in order to access the blocks they need. This is required every time a student opens a new <span class="snap">snap</span> window. (Links to projects in the curriculum have been shared with the tools already imported.)</li>
            	<li><strong>Exploring List Blocks:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This page asks students to build the blocks (rather than providing a link that has the blocks built already). This is intentional, so that students get the experience of finding these blocks in the palette and getting the logic of what kinds of blocks go inside of other blocks.</li>
                        <li>Students explore blocks such as <code>all but the first of {}</code>, <code>() in front of {}</code>, and <code>item () of {}</code>. Consider asking students to write out a sentence describing the behavior of each of these blocks or to describe them to the class</li>
                        <li>Listen for students making the distinction between expressions that report strings (such as "Boise") and those that report a list containing one item (such as <code>{Boise}</code>). If you don't hear students making this distinction, consider a brief class discussion about it. Distinguishing the logic between what data type is reported is a big help when debugging.</li>
