    	<h2>Programming Lab 2: Nesting Lists</h2>
        <p>Lists can contain anything: numbers, strings, other lists, even blocks. The objects <em>in</em> a list can be all of the same kind (all numbers, for example, or all lists that contain a name and a phone number). But the objects can also be of different types that list of name and phone number, for example). The tabular data we are familiar with in spreadsheets can be represented as a list of same-length lists, the smaller lists representing each row in the table, and the enclosing list representing the entire spreadsheet.

          <!--A table of data, is a list of rows of data, each row being a list of data.-->
Selecting information in the dataset involves only knowing where it appears. The &quot;ordered pairs&quot; of algebra, the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) coordinates of a point, can be represented as lists. So can vectors and matrices. The <code>list</code> block is the basic building block of these  complex structures.</p>
        <p>Blocks can locate items in the nested lists. For example, <code>item (3) of </code> the list of points below gives <var> {10, 120}</var>. As the sprite visits each of these points (in a <code>for each</code> block) the point (10, 120) is the third that it visits.  </p>
		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/A.png" alt="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" title="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" />
        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/drawA.gif" alt="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" title="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" />

        <p>Students start by construcing a very simple shopping list app. They later create a contact list app whose elements are themselves lists. This requires not only collecting and storing information, but being able to retrieve it in useful ways. Students use <code>keep</code> to be able to collect only the information they need from a list, and learn to use <code>for each</code> to process lists of points on the plane&mdash;points which are themselves lists of coordinates. Data Types, a later page in this lab, returns to the idea of using abstraction to make the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) coordinate lists more recognizable and usable by creating the <strong>abstract data type</strong> <code>point</code> and constructing and identifying these coordinate lists that way. After some embellishment of the contact app, practicing and extending the ideas of abstraction, and a Lists Review and Self Check, students extend their use of <code>for each</code> and data types to a musical context.</p>
<p>Thus in Labs 1 and 2, students have encountered lists of strings/words, numbers, and lists. They also use <em>abstraction</em> to clarify and simplify code, and see how it makes code more flexible and maintainable. </p>

                        <li>The Contact List project is ambitious but carefully scaffolded. It's helpful for you to remember its ultimate goal, which is to introduce the idea of <strong>data abstraction</strong>, in which an abstract data type is defined by writing <em>constructor</em> and <em>selector</em> blocks that are the sole program interface to the underlying list structure. We start without data abstraction, so you see lots of <code>item 2 of</code> when a phone number is wanted. By the end of the project, there should be no more <code>item</code> calls in the user interface blocks.  Students will be inclined to resist data abstraction, because it makes the program longer. But the project uses a change in the underlying representation to convince them that it's much easier to maintain a large program if such changes affect only the constructor and selectors.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"Abstract data type" sounds like a complicated thing, but programmers actually use them to simplify the logical structure of their code. It is reasonable to think of an abstract data type like a "template" for data&mdash;for example, if you had everyone in class fill out a form with their name, address, email, etc., that form would be like an abstract data type (except for being a real paper form&mdash;not an abstract digital artifact).</li>

            	</li>
            	<li><strong>Page 4: Improving Your Contact List App.</strong>
            	  <ul>
            	    <li>This is a longer page, and it's possible for students to lose the big picture among all the details. You should understand the following structure of the three green For You To Do boxes:
                      <ul>
                        <li>The first box breaks the app by making a change to its data structure. Don't let students get discouraged by this; it'll work out fine in the end. The moral of this first part is that programs can be <em>brittle</em> when any part of the program changes.</li>
                        <li>The second box makes the program less brittle by formally defining a Contact <em>abstract data type.</em> 
                          <ul>
                            <li>Such a definition consists of one (occasionally more) <em>constructor</em> block, and several <em>selector</em> blocks. The former creates an instance of the data type; the latter pull out pieces from such an instance. Once the ADT is set up and is consistently used by the rest of the program, it's possible to change the internal representation without breaking anything other than the constructor and selectors. </li>
                            <li>If students think this is too much work for the benefit, ask them to imagine a real-world program with thousands of blocks (procedures) and dozens of data types. Then imagine the situation in the first green box: You need to move the phone number from item 2 to item 3 of a contact. Without data abstraction, you'd have to scan through the entire program looking for <code>item 2 of</code> expressions, and for each one you find, you have to work out whether it is looking at a contact (in which case you should change the item number) or at something else represented by a list (in which case you shouldn't. With data abstraction, there are no <code>item</code> calls outside of the selectors; the rest of the program should keep working smoothly when the representation changes.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The third block gives the payoff for this work. We now want two kinds of contacts, ones with the family name first  and one with the given names first. We make a major change to the constructors (two of them, now) and selectors, but the rest of the program still works, better than ever.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Students familiar with music may want to use fractions (e.g. 0.25, 0.5, etc.) to represent note lengths (e.g. quarter notes, half notes, etc.) and adjust their tempo(s) accordingly. Integer note lengths are offered on the lab pages for students unfamiliar with the nuances of representing musical time signatures as decimals (e.g. 0.25 + 0.5 being a full measure in 3/4 time, but not 4/4 time). Integers work just as well and are more forgiving.</li>
