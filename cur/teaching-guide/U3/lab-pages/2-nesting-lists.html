    	<h2>Programming Lab 2: Nesting Lists</h2>
        <p>Lists can contain anything: numbers, strings, other lists, even blocks. The objects <em>in</em> a list can be all of the same kind (all numbers, for example, or all lists that contain a name and a phone number). But the objects can also be of different types that list of name and phone number, for example). The tabular data we are familiar with in spreadsheets can be represented as a list of same-length lists, the smaller lists representing each row in the table, and the enclosing list representing the entire spreadsheet.

          <!--A table of data, is a list of rows of data, each row being a list of data.-->
Selecting information in the dataset involves only knowing where it appears. The &quot;ordered pairs&quot; of algebra, the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) coordinates of a point, can be represented as lists. So can vectors and matrices. The <code>list</code> block is the basic building block of these  complex structures.</p>
        <p>Blocks can locate items in the nested lists. For example, <code>item (3) of </code> the list of points below gives <var> {10, 120}</var>. As the sprite visits each of these points (in a <code>for each</code> block) the point (10, 120) is the third that it visits.  </p>
		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/A.png" alt="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" title="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" />
        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/drawA.gif" alt="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" title="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" />

        <p>Students start by construcing a very simple shopping list app. They later create a contact list app whose elements are themselves lists. This requires not only collecting and storing information, but being able to retrieve it in useful ways. Students use <code>keep</code> to be able to collect only the information they need from a list, and learn to use <code>for each</code> to process lists of points on the plane&mdash;points which are themselves lists of coordinates. Data Types, a later page in this lab, returns to the idea of using abstraction to make the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) coordinate lists more recognizable and usable by creating the <strong>abstract data type</strong> <code>point</code> and constructing and identifying these coordinate lists that way. After some embellishment of the contact app, practicing and extending the ideas of abstraction, and a Lists Review and Self Check, students extend their use of <code>for each</code> and data types to a musical context.</p>
<p>Thus in Labs 1 and 2, students have encountered lists of strings/words, numbers, and lists. They also use <em>abstraction</em> to clarify and simplify code, and see how it makes code more flexible and maintainable. </p>

                	<strong>Pages 1 and 1.5: Contact List App.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Discussion: You might ask these questions:
                            <ul>
                                <li>What kinds of objects can go in lists?</li>
                                <li>What kinds of things can you do with a list of lists?</li>
                                <li>Do the lists inside a list <em>need to</em> be the same size?</li>
                                <li>In what other situations might a list of lists be helpful?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The Contact List project is ambitious but carefully scaffolded. It's helpful for you to remember its ultimate goal, which is to introduce the idea of <strong>data abstraction</strong>, in which an abstract data type is defined by writing <em>constructor</em> and <em>selector</em> blocks that are the sole program interface to the underlying list structure. We start without data abstraction, so you see lots of <code>item 2 of</code> when a phone number is wanted. By the end of the project, there should be no more <code>item</code> calls in the user interface blocks.  Students will be inclined to resist data abstraction, because it makes the program longer. But the project uses a change in the underlying representation to convince them that it's much easier to maintain a large program if such changes affect only the constructor and selectors.</li>

                        <li>Discussion: After all students have read through the dialogue a few times (and perhaps also added the abstract data type to their U3L1-DrawShape project), you might review with questions like these:

		                        <li>What are some benefits of creating an abstract data type?</li>

                            Downloading and importing sprite costumes is easy, but there are a few steps to note:
                            <ul>
                                <li>First, right click to save the file to a location on your harddrive where you can easily find it again.</li>
                                <li>In Snap<em>!</em>, add a new sprite with the desired name, and <em>with that sprite selected</em>, locate and drag the image file from the location where you saved it to the Snap<em>!</em> window.</li>
                                <li>(An alternative to the second step is to select &quot;Import...&quot; from the File menu, then choose the image file in the file browser that appears.)</li>

                        <li>"Abstract data type" sounds like a complicated thing, but programmers actually use them to simplify the logical structure of their code. It is reasonable to think of an abstract data type like a "template" for data&mdash;for example, if you had everyone in class fill out a form with their name, address, email, etc., that form would be like an abstract data type (except for being a real paper form&mdash;not an abstract digital artifact).</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Students familiar with music may want to use fractions (e.g. 0.25, 0.5, etc.) to represent note lengths (e.g. quarter notes, half notes, etc.) and adjust their tempo(s) accordingly. Integer note lengths are offered on the lab pages for students unfamiliar with the nuances of representing musical time signatures as decimals (e.g. 0.25 + 0.5 being a full measure in 3/4 time, but not 4/4 time). Integers work just as well and are more forgiving.</li>
