    	<h2>Programming Lab 2: Nesting Lists</h2>
        <p>A list of same-size lists forms a table, a two-dimensional array of data. <!--A table of data, is a list of rows of data, each row being a list of data.--> The ordered and nested indicies of the lists provide a logical structure for accessing information in the dataset. In mathematics, lists appear as vectors and lists of lists as matrices. The <code>list</code> is the basic building block of these more complex structures.</p>
        <p>Lists that appear as elements of another list are called "nested lists". Blocks can locate items in the nested lists and also the nexted lists themselves (with all their items inside). For example, <code>item (3) of </code> the list of points below gives <var>list {10, 120}</var>. As the sprite visits each of these points (in a <code>for each</code> block) the point (10, 120) is the third that it visits.  </p>
		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/A.png" alt="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" title="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" />
        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/drawA.gif" alt="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" title="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" />

        <p>Lists can go inside lists inside lists and so on, but Unit 3 only covers two-dimensions of nesting: lists of lists which form arrays.</p>
        <p>Students begin the Lab on page 1, Lists of Lists, where they explore list reporters with nested lists and create a contact list app that collects and stores phone numbers and names. Then on page 2, The <code>For Each</code> Block, they use <code>for each</code> to process lists of points on the plane&mdash;points which are themselves lists. Page 3, Data Types, introduces the idea of using abstraction to make the lists inside the list more usable, namely, labeling them as points. Finally in page 4, Lists Review and Self Check students use <code>for each</code> two write two additional sprites (Show Contact and Delete Contact) for their Contact List app and extend their use of <code>for each</code> and data types to a musical context.</p>
        <p>Thus in Labs 1 and 2, students have encountered lists of strings/words, numbers, and lists. They also use <em>abstraction</em> to clarify and simplify code, clarifying the role of a pair of numbers as the coordinates of a <code>point</code> (or the attributes of a <code>note</code>) not just as the elements of a <code>list</code>. </p> 
        
        <h3>Pacing:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>The four pages of this lab are each expected to be relatively quick, approximately 1 class period each.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
				<li>Page 1, Lists of Lists, and Page 4, Lists Review and Self Check include a new Contact List app that was not part of this curriculum until October 2015. Teachers should review and work though these pages. Feedback is always appreciated.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h3>Students will:</h3>
        <!--<div class="sidenoteBig">

                <li>Use the <code>for each</code> block to access each item of a list.</li>
                <li>Create abstract data types to organize and manage data.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Discussion, you might ask:
                            <ul>
                                <li>What is a list of lists?</li>
                                <li>What kinds of things can you do with a list of lists?</li>
                                <li>Do the lists inside a list <em>need to</em> be the same size?</li>
                                <li>What can be done if the lists inside a list <em>are</em> the same size?</li>
		                        <li>In what other situations might a list of lists be helpful?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>You might consider asking students (or pairs) to write a sentence for each of the list reporters decribing how they treat lists of lists. Or you could discuss this as a class as well.</li>
                    </ul>
            	</li>

                    </ul>
            	</li>
                <li>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Discussion: After all students have read through the dialogue a few times (and perhaps also added the abstract data type to their U3L1-DrawShape project), you might review with questions like these:
                        	<ul>
		                        <li>What is the benefit of creating an abstract data type?</li>
		                        <li>In what other situations might abstract data types be helpful?</li>
                                <li>What kind of data types does a list take? Lists take any type of input (primative or abstract data types)</li>
		                        <li>What is a <em>primitive</em> data type? What are some examples?</li>
		                        <li>What is a <em>abstract</em> data type? What are some examples?</li>
                                <li>What is the difference between a primitive data type and an abstract data type?</li>
                                <li>How are abstract data types an example of abstraction?</li> 
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Consider inviting students with musical training to present basic music theory (especially classical note pitch and beat length representation) and to share and describe their music script(s) with the class.</li>

                                <li>In Snap<em>!</em>, add a new sprite with the desired name, and <em>with that sprite selected</em>, click the "Costumes" tab.</li>
                                <li>Locate and drag the image file from the location where you saved it to the open "Costumes" tab.</li>

                        <li>Encourage students to first complete the two blanks in the script (shown at right) and only after most of the letter is drawing	 correctly to begin addressing the two bugs at the beginning and end of the drawing process.</li>

                        <li>"Abstract data type" sounds like a complicated thing, but programmers actually use them to simplify the logical structure of their code. It is reasonable to think of an abstract data type like a "template" for data&mdash;for example, if you had everyone in class fill out a form with their name, address, email, etc., that form would be like an abstract data type (except for being a real paper form&mdash;not an abstract digital artifact).</li>

                        <li>Students familiar with music may want to use fractions (e.g. 0.25, 0.5, etc.) to represent note lengths (e.g. quarter notes, half notes, etc.) and adjust their tempo(s) accordingly. Integer note lengths are offered on the lab pages for students unfamiliar with the nuances of representing musical time signatures as decimals (e.g. 0.25 + 0.5 being a full measure in 3/4 time, but not 4/4 time). Integers work just as well and are more forgiving.</li>
