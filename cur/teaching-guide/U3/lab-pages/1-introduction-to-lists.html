    	<h2>Programming Lab 1: Introduction to Lists</h2>
        <p>Computers manipulate information they are given and return processed information to the user. Numbers, strings of characters (for example, words), and Boolean values (true, false) are some of the basic pieces of information. Often these small pieces are arranged in more complex structures: trees of information, lists (in mathematics, vectors), tables or arrays (in mathematics, matrices), and more.  The <code>list</code> is the basic building block of all those more complex structures.  A table of data, for example, is a list of rows of data, each row being a list of data.  A <code>list</code> is not just a collection (set) but a collection <em>in a particular order</em>. If it has any elements at all, it has a first element, a last element, and so on.  You can search a list to see if it <code>contains</code> some element; you can create new lists that <code>keep</code> only certain items from a list you started with; you can create new lists with more or fewer elements than the list you have; and you can pick an <code>item of</code> a list by position, or characteristic, or just randomly.  A <code>list</code> can be totally empty, with no elements at all; often that is the way we want to start (initialize) a list before we add elements to it. The <code>length of</code> such a list is 0.  An item (e.g., almonds) is not the same as a <em>list</em> containing just that item. And you can do something with each item of the list: you can process it in some way (e.g., <code>map</code> a function over each element and report the resulting list) or, <code>for each</code> element of the list, you can display it in some way.</p>
        <p>Students begin Lab 1 by building a very elementary shopping list app: it its simplest form, the app allows the user only to add items to the list or clear the list. Students can later add more features as they learn more about list processing.  Students also process lists of points on the plane and lists of notes in a melody. The points and notes are, themselves list of two numbers, in one case the list (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>), and in the other case the list (pitch, duration). Thus, students, in Lab 1, have encountered lists of strings/words, numbers, and lists. They also use <em>abstraction</em> to clarify and simplify code, clarifying the role of a pair of numbers as the coordinates of a <code>point</code> (or the attributes of a <code>note</code>) not just as the elements of a <code>list</code>. </p>

        	<ul>
                <li><div class="sidenote">Many of the <span class="snap">snap</span> projects linked from the student pages already have the tools imported.</div>Throughout this Unit, students will have to <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" /> in order to access the blocks they need. This is required every time a student opens a new <span class="snap">snap</span> window.</li>
            	<li><strong>Exploring List Blocks:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This page asks students to build the blocks (rather than providing a link that has the blocks built already). This is intentional, so that students get the experience of finding these blocks in the palette and getting the logic of what kinds of blocks go inside of other blocks.</li>
                        <li>Students explore blocks such as <code>all but the first of {}</code>, <code>() in front of {}</code>, and <code>item () of {}</code>. Consider asking students to write out a sentence describing the behavior of each of these blocks or to describe them to the class</li>
                        <li>Listen for students making the distinction between expressions that report strings (such as "Boise") and those that report a list containing one item (such as <code>{Boise}</code>). If you don't hear students making this distinction, consider a brief class discussion about it. Distinguishing the logic between what data type is reported is a big help when debugging.</li>
