		<h3>Tips:</h3>
		<div>
        	<ul>
            	<li><strong>Getting Started:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This page asks students to build the blocks (rather than providing a link that has the blocks built already). This is intentional, so that students get the experience of finding these blocks in the palette and getting the logic of what blocks go inside of other blocks.</li>
                        <li>Problem 2 is subtle. The first block reports the string "Boise", whereas the second block reports a <strong>list</strong> containing the item "Boise". If you don't hear students making this distinction, consider reviewing this problem as a class. Distinguishing the logic between what data type is reported is a big help when debugging.</li>
                        <li>Problem 3b gives the result "NaN". This stands for "Not a Number" and results because the sum operation expects numbers as its inputs, and 3b has included a list as one of the inputs.</li>
                        <li>Problem 5 includes a list within a list.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><div class="sidenote">Many of the <span class="snap">snap</span> projects linked from the student pages already have the tools imported.</div>Throughout this Unit, students will have to Import Tools in order to access the blocks they need. This is required every time a student opens a new <span class="snap">snap</span> window.</li>
