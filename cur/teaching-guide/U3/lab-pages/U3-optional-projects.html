							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>Apply skills with developing algorithms and using loops in the context of a visual arts project.</li>

							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>Students can approach this project in two different ways: one is to fix the Cartesian coordinates of the virtual strings; and the other is to use a turtle geometry approach in which motions are relative. The initial task for students is probably easier with fixed coordinates, but the Take It Further A, if the students start the projects with relative positions. Either approach is acceptable. The solutions provided use fixed coordinates.</li>
                                <li>Some students may find it difficult to generalize the algorithm they developed to generate the first quadrant of the design and apply it to other quadrants.  The first quadrant involves joining <em>positive</em> y-axis points to <em>positive</em> x-axis points, while the second quadrant involves joining positive y-axis points to <em>negative</em> x-axis points, etc. You might help students see this by asking them to draw the design on graph paper and label the connection points.</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This is a fairly advanced and subtle project for students with a keen interest in computational visual art.</li>
								<li>The coding for this project will be challenging for most students but the hints should help.  Encourage them to do a lot of thinking and write out the algorithm prior to coding.</li>

                				<li>Students will need headphones or speakers to work on the Music Project. Headphones are recommended to reduce distraction to other students. Pairs may appreciate having two sets of headphones and a headphone splitter, which costs about $5-$10, if working on a computer without two audio output ports.</li>
                                <li>Students familiar with music may want to use fractions (e.g. 0.25, 0.5, etc.) to represent note lengths (e.g. quarter notes, half notes, etc.) and adjust the tempo accordingly. Integer note lengths are offered on the lab pages for students unfamiliar with the nuances of representing musical time signatures as decimals (e.g. 0.25 + 0.5 being a full measure in 3/4 time, but not 4/4 time). Integers work just as well and are more forgiving.</li>
                                <li>Consider inviting students with musical training to present basic music theory (especially <!--Not sure what this means: classical note pitch and--> beat length representation) and to share and describe their music script(s) with the class.</li>
