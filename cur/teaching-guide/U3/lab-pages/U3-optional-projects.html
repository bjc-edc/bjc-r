		<h3>Lab Pages</h3>

			<ul>
            <li>
					<strong>Page 1: Astrid Design.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Apply skills at developing algorithms and using abstractions in the context of a visual arts project.</li>
								<li>Gain dexterity in the field of computational art.</li>
                                <li>Synthesize artistic sensibilities and programming instincts.</li>
								
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                           
								<li>Some students, looking ahead at the Take It Further exercises, may try to use too much abstraction in their initial construction of the Astrid and get frustrated at their lack of progress.  The task given in the For You To Do exercises requires only joining points with <em>fixed</em> coordinates and should be relatively straightforward to do with the use of a <code>for</code> loop.  Encourage them not to look too far ahead into the Take It Further activities which involve significantly harder tasks.</li>
                                <li>Some students will find it difficult to generalize the algorithm they developed to generate the first quadrant Astrid and apply it to other quadrants.   It might be helpful to bring to their attention that first quadrant Astrid involves joining positive y-axis points to positive x-axis points, while the second quadrant Astrid involves joining positive y-axis points to negative x-axis points, etc.</li>

					<strong>Page 2: Animation Studio.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Review and gain practice with lists in an enjoyable context.</li>
								<li>Create computational environment for creative artistic expression.</li>
                                <li>Use this project as a stepping stone to exploring advanced animation studio tools like Maya 3D, Unity 3D.</li>
                                <li>Learn about internship opportunities at animation studios like Pixar.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This is a fairly accessible project for students who enjoy art and animation.  It can be used anytime during or after Unit 3 to motivate and personalize work with lists.</li>
								<li>Students may need some help accessing more advanced animation studio tools like Maya 3D, Unity 3D, if they choose to go beyond the project.</li>
                                <li>Students may need some encouragement looking for internship opportunities at studios like Pixar.</li>

							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This is a fairly advanced and subtle project for students with a keen interest in computational visual art.</li>
								<li>The coding for this project will be challenging for most students but the hints should help.  Encourage them to do a lot of thinking and write out the algorithm prior to coding.</li>

							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Explore computational methods of creative expression through music.</li>
                                <li>Review abstract data types.</li>
                            	<li>Review higher order functions.</li>

								<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/headphones.png" alt="Set Up Your Headphones or Speakers" title="Set Up Your Headphones or Speakers" />
                				<li>Students will need headphones or speakers to work on the Music Project. Headphones are recommended to reduce distraction to other students. Pairs may appreciate having two sets of headphones and a headphone splitter, which costs about $5-$10, if working on a computer without two audio output ports.</li>
                                <li>Students familiar with music may want to use fractions (e.g. 0.25, 0.5, etc.) to represent note lengths (e.g. quarter notes, half notes, etc.) and adjust the tempo accordingly. Integer note lengths are offered on the lab pages for students unfamiliar with the nuances of representing musical time signatures as decimals (e.g. 0.25 + 0.5 being a full measure in 3/4 time, but not 4/4 time). Integers work just as well and are more forgiving.</li>
                                <li>Consider inviting students with musical training to present basic music theory (especially <!--Not sure what this means: classical note pitch and--> beat length representation) and to share and describe their music script(s) with the class.</li>

		<div class="todo">Modeling Sentence Structures Stuff from Y2U3L1:
			<ul>
                <li>
					<strong>Goals for the Lab: Page 3: Modeling Sentence Structures.</strong>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Use the <code>join</code> and <code>join words</code> blocks.</li>
                    	<li>Algorithmically select from lists.</li>
                		<li>Randomly choose items from lists of words to make a Sentence Builder.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>As a Class: Page 3: Modeling Sentence Structures.</strong> 
                	<ul>
                    	<li>The page is designed to offer a fun mini-project in which the use of lists feels natural and empowering. Encourage students to be creative and build other kinds of sentences or even simple conversations.</li>
                        <li>This lesson relies on proficiency in programming more than knowledge of English sentence structure. For this kind of project, English is particularly easy because it has hardly any inflections (case, tense, mood, etc.), but students may try this project in a language other than English, if they like. Languages present different challenges but students can adjust their lists or their coding to make the project work. Students could work with others or alone and then share. Be creative. For example, it might be beneficial to pair a student studying Spanish with a fluent Spanish speaker. </li>
                        <li>As always, if students do interesting work (e.g. with another language or with the Take It Further problems), consider inviting them to share with the class.</li>
		                <li>Discussion, you might ask: How do the sentence builder blocks demonstrate abstraction?</li>
                        
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                    	<li>The English grammar on this page may be too complex for some English Language Learners to stay focused on the computer science. On the other hand, English is the least inflected natural language, and even an ESL student may find the <em>programming</em> easier in English.</li>
