		<h2>Optional Projects</h2>
		<p>These optional programming projects are designed to supplement the required lab pages. There are many options for using these projects, and they depend on your pacing through the curriculum and the students in your class. You may decide to have each student select one project, or you may have them each build several. You may have students work individually, or you may have them pair program. You may have them work on their own time, or you may allocate class time for these projects.</p> 
		

		<h3>Pacing</h3>
		<div>
			Expected times to complete each optional project follow, but these times will vary significantly depending on your students:
			<ul>
				<li>40-80 minutes (1-2 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/optional-projects/1-animation-studio.html">Animation Studio</a></li>
				<li>60-120 minutes (2-3 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/optional-projects/2-op-art.html">Op Art</a></li>
				<!--<li>X-X minutes (X-X class periods) on <a href=""></a></li>

		<h3>Lab Pages</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
            <li>
					<strong>Page 1: Animation Studio.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Review and gain practice with lists in an enjoyable context.</li>
								<li>Create computational environment for creative artistic expression.</li>
                                <li>Use this project as a stepping stone to exploring advanced animation studio tools like Maya 3D, Unity 3D.</li>
                                <li>Learn about internship opportunities at animation studios like Pixar.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This is a fairly accessible project for students who enjoy art and animation.  It can be used anytime during or after Unit 3 to motivate and personalize work with lists.</li>
								<li>Students may need some help accessing more advanced animation studio tools like Maya 3D, Unity 3D, if they choose to go beyond the project.</li>
                                <li>Students may need some encouragement looking for internship opportunities at studios like Pixar.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
<li>
					<strong>Page 2: Op Art.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Learn the value of writing pseudocode for large and complex programs.</li>
								<li>Understand the subtleties of sequencing in complex code.</li>
                                <li>Explore art in a computational context.</li>
                                
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This is a fairly advanced and subtle project for students with a keen interest in computational visual art.</li>
								<li>The coding for this project will be challenging for most students but the hints should help.  Enocurage them to do a lot of thinking and write pseudocode prior to coding.</li>
							</ul>

					<strong>Goals for the Lab: Page 3: Modeling Sentence Structures (Teacher's Choice).</strong>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Use the <code>join</code> and <code>join words</code> blocks.</li>
                    	<li>Algorithmically select from lists.</li>
                		<li>Randomly choose items from lists of words to make a Sentence Builder.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>As a Class: Page 3: Modeling Sentence Structures (Teacher's Choice).</strong> 
                	<ul>
                    	<li>The page is designed to offer a fun mini-project in which the use of lists feels natural and empowering. Encourage students to be creative and build other kinds of sentences or even simple conversations.</li>
                        <li>This lesson relies on proficiency in programming more than knowledge of English sentence structure. For this kind of project, English is particularly easy because it has hardly any inflections (case, tense, mood, etc.), but students may try this project in a language other than English, if they like. Languages present different challenges but students can adjust their lists or their coding to make the project work. Students could work with others or alone and then share. Be creative. For example, it might be beneficial to pair a student studying Spanish with a fluent Spanish speaker. </li>
                        <li>As always, if students do interesting work (e.g. with another language or with the Take It Further problems), consider inviting them to share with the class.</li>
		                <li>Discussion, you might ask: How do the sentence builder blocks demonstrate abstraction?</li>

					<ul>
                    	<li>The English grammar on this page may be too complex for some English Language Learners to stay focused on the computer science. On the other hand, English is the least inflected natural language, and even an ESL student may find the <em>programming</em> easier in English.</li>
