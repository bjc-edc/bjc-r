            <strong>Former purpose ramblings</strong>
            <p>This lab does not introduce new ideas, but gives students practice applying MAP, KEEP, and COMBINE in several contexts, in order to master the use of these powerful tools and to learn to think in terms of what they can do.</p> 
            <p>Lists of same-size lists can function as tables or matrices. Tic-Tac-Toe... Magic Squares gives students a game context in which to practice further their use of lists and list processing functions.</p> 
        </div>
        
		<p>Anything that can be handled by creating and manipulating a list can also be done without lists, just by working with the individual elements and keeping track of that process. But list processing—especially list processing with  the higher order functions <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code> (and, later in this course, recursion)—is powerful. It lets the programmer focus on the purpose and meaning of the program—what the program is intended to do—and not on tiny local details of how to do it, details that essentially reinvent  a clumsy equivalent of lists and ways to work sequentially through them.</p>
        <p>Becoming facile with list processing takes practice, and initially requires contexts in which the meaning of the lists and the purpose and meaning of the functions that process them are clear.  One subtlety of working with lists is that it requires thinking simultaneously about the list as a <em>single object</em> and, at the same time, recognizing that much of what one wants to do with the list involves processing some or all of the <em>elements</em> of the list. That is also part of the subtlety of the higher-order functions, which take an entire list as a single object and handle the individual elements of the list in various ways, as determined by the programmer. <em>Composing</em> higher order functions is yet more powerful, but also more challenging, because each one does so much that the programmer needs to picture large effects and the interactions of these large effects.</p>
        <p>This lab gives students practice applying <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>  in several contexts to build their facility with these powerful tools and to learn to think in terms of what they can do. It does not introduce new ideas, but focuses on mastery and application.</p>-->
		<p>In this lab, students will continue the Tic-Tac-Toe project by teaching the computer how to detect a win or a tie.  To do this, the program must remember the moves that have been made. (In a sense, the program already <em>does</em> have that memory, but it is spread out among the nine sprite clones representing the individual squares. Here we add a model of the board in one place, so the program can reason about it.)</p>
		<p>The capacity to remember and analyze moves will later be used to let the program make sensible moves as a player.</p>

		<h3>Pacing</h3>
		<div>
			The 2 lab pages could be split across 3-4 days (<strong>110-160 minutes</strong>). Expected times to complete follow:
			<ul>
				<li>If used, 30-40 minutes (1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-tic-tac-toe/1-find-ties.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Remembering the Moves</a>*</li>
				<li>If used, 80-120 minutes (2-3 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-tic-tac-toe/2-find-wins.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Detecting Wins and Ties</a>*</li>

								<li>The purpose of  the preparatory activities on this page may not be immediately clear to students.  Why do we need to have each square sprite have its own unique <var>square number</var> variable?  Why do we create a global <var>board</var> variable when each sprite already knows if it has been clicked?  The purpose should become clear on the next page, where students will learn how to use the global state of the board in order to detect wins and ties. If students seem to be losing the plot, ask them to think, without writing code, about how a program would know when someone has won the game.</li>

                                	Some students may try to determine if there has been a win in the game by using eight nested <code>if then</code> conditionals:<br />
                                	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/9conditionalsapproachto TTT.png" height="200" alt=""/><br />
                                	As always, don't tell them that their working solution is wrong; still, encourage them  to understand the elegance and simplicity of using <code>map</code> in solving this problem.
                                (What if we were playing tic-tac-toe on a chessboard, so there would be many more winning triples? Would you still want to enumerate them in nested conditionals?)</li>
								<li>
                                    Once the students have written the <code>status of winning triples</code> block, it will be beneficial for them to compare the status of each winning triple to the corresponding configuration on the board.  For example the eighth row of the list that the <code>status of winning triples</code> block reports is the status of the diagonal with squares {3,5,7}, namely {X, Empty, Empty}, agreeing with the board picture. <br />
                                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/statusoftriples.png" height="200" alt=""/>
                                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/statusoftriplesBoardcrossed.png" height="200" alt=""/>
                                </li>
								<li>
                                    The elegant solution with <code>map</code> will use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/contains.png"  height="40" alt=""/> block to  test all the possible winning triples at once. It may not be obvious to some students that this block can have a list of lists as an input as shown below.<br />
                                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/containswithlistoflist.png"  height="50" alt=""/><br />
If this is an issue, encourage them not to think of a list of lists as a special case; lists are values, just as numbers are values, and a list can include any values.
								</li>
                                
                               <!-- <li>Create blocks to use with higher order list functions to perform complicated data lookups and modifies.</li>

                                <li>Refining this game builds on students' understanding of lists and list operations including higher order functions. This is likely to feel very satisfying to students, a major accomplishment. It is! <!--You may wish to review some list blocks by asking students to describe the expected behavior of a few short scripts or expressions.--></li>

			<!--<h4>Computational Thinking Practices:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Coming soon...</li>
			</ul-->
			<h4>Essential Understandings:</h4>
			<p>Students think simultaneously about lists as a <em>single object</em> and, at the same time, as a set of <em>elements</em> to be processed (<strong>EU 2.1</strong>) as they build encoding/decoding functions and a tic-tac-toe game.</p>
            <p>This lab builds toward this EU with a mini-project in which students are required to use lists to represent  the moves in a tic-tac-toe game. Students must also use procedural abstraction; for example, a procedure to test whether player X has won in tic-tac-toe is built out of, a procedure that reports all of the eight winning combinations of squares and a function that tests whether a list of cells is a  winning combination.</p>
			<ul>
                <li><strong>EU 2.1</strong> A variety of abstractions built on binary sequences can be used to represent all digital data.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
			<p>Students compose higher order functions to develop a tic-tac-toe script that checks the board for wins (<strong>LO 2.2.2</strong>).</p>
			<ul>
                <li><strong>LO 2.2.2</strong> Use multiple levels of abstraction to write programs. [P3]</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Essential Knowledge:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>EK 2.1.1A</strong> Digital data is represented by abstractions at different levels.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 3.1.3E</strong> Interactivity with data is an aspect of communicating.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.2.1B</strong> Program instructions are executed sequentially.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.2.1C</strong> Program instructions may involve variables that are initialized and updated, read, and written.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.3.1K</strong> Lists and list operations, such as add, remove, and search, are common in many programs.</li> 
                <li><strong>EK 5.3.1L</strong> Using lists and procedures as abstractions in programming can result in programs that are easier to develop and maintain.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.5.1H</strong> Computational methods may use lists and collections to solve problems.</li>
