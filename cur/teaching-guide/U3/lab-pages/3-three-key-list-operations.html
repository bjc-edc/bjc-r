<h2><b>Programming Lab 3: Three Key List Operations</b></h2>
<p>Functions that <i>take other functions as input</i> are called <b>higher order functions</b>. In this unit (and often but not always in practice) these are used for processing lists. <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-introduction-to-lists/5-the-for-each-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&amp;course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment">In Lab 1</a>, students worked with <code>for each</code> to apply a procedure to each item of a list, but itâ€™s not a function. Now students focus on three higher order list operations: <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>.</p>
<p>While <code>for each</code> is a command block that steps through each item in a list to use or make changes to the items, <code>combine</code> reports a single result, and <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> both report new lists:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Map</code> takes two inputs, a function and a list. It <i>applies the function to each item of a list</i> and returns a new list (without changing the original) in which each element is the result of applying the function to the corresponding element of the original list. The applied function can be anything that accepts the list items as input: it could double a number, make a word plural, replace an item by a selection from some other list, etc.</li>
  <li><code>Keep</code> takes two inputs, a predicate function and a list. It <i>filters the list</i>, returning a list of all (and only) those items in the original list for which the predicate returns <code>true</code>. <code>keep</code> might be used to filter a list and return only the items that begin with a vowel, or are even number, or are less than five characters long, or (as in the Tic Tac Toe lab) are the moves made by player x.</li>
  <li><code>Combine</code> takes two inputs, a function and a list, and <i>combines all the items in the list using that function</i>. It returns a single result (e.g. a sum, product, concatenated string, etc.). <code>Combine</code> applies its two-input operation by repeatedly calling that  operation on a result-so-far and one new list item. <code>Combine</code> should be used only with associative functions: addition, multiplication, join, and very few others.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Students will apply these tools various context including an overarching theme of lists of lists to manage and organize data in apps (shopping list, contact lists, tic tac toe, etc.).</p>

<h3 ><b>Pacing:</b></h3>
<p>The 4 lab pages could be split across 5 to 7 days. Expected times to complete follow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The introductory page, Exploring List Operations, are expected to be relatively quick, <i>less than 1 class period</i>.</li>
  <li>The <code>Map</code>, <code>Keep</code>, and <code>Combine</code> lab pages each have several sections with different (if any) project files and a quiz.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Nesting Functions may take <i>about a day</i>.</li>
    <li><code>Map</code> may take <i>2-3 days</i>.</li>
    <li><code>Keep</code> may take <i>1-2 days</i>.</li>
    <li><code>Combine</code> may take <i>1-2 days</i>.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3><b>Students will:</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Learn about higher order functions.</li>
  <li>Learn to use <code>for each</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code> on their own and together to access and manipulate list data.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>As a Class:</b></h3>

  <li><b>Page 2: <code>Map</code>.</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>The section, Using <code>Map</code> for Algebraic Functions, presents an example of using Snap<i>!</i> to model this algebraic function: $$f(n)=3n+7$$ Encourage students to identify a function (or several) of interest to them and build a reporter to run it. For example, they might calculate values of a function needed for a math or science assignment (or any other school or non-school context).</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Page 4: <code>Combine</code>.</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>The constraints of the functional input for <code>combine</code> are straightforward (an associative operation with two blank input slots), but as they are different from <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> (whose input functions require one blank input slot). You may wish to discuss the <code>combine</code> input requirements and the issue of associativity, which is also addressed in the student lab pages.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3><b>Assignments:</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Encourage students to identify places where <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code> may help with a program with lists that they have already developed and to take the time to improve their programs.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Tips:</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Page 1: Exploring List Operations.</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Problem 1 part b gives the result "NaN". This stands for "Not a Number" and results because the sum operation expects numbers as its inputs, and this expression includes a list as one of the inputs.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Page 2: <code>Map</code>.</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Watch for students who are particularly adapt with translating, dilating, and reflecting computer graphics or with composing and transposing music. Encourage these students to develop these projects further and/or to present their work to the class.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Page 3: <code>Keep</code>.</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Students develop a small database of first name, last name, age (in years), and height (in inches). Encourage students to keep the dataset small (4-6 records) to minimize time lost on data entry.</li>
    <li>You might also discuss whether it's ethical to put this data in a shared project.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Page 4: <code>Combine</code>.</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>The two quizzes on this page address all three higher order functions in this lab: <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>. Encourage students to use these questions to assess how well they have learned these ideas. If necessary, they may wish to review.</li>
  </ul>
