		<h2>Programming Lab 3: Three Key List Operations</h2>
		<p>Higher order functions accept other functions as input. <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-introduction-to-lists/5-the-for-each-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">In Lab 1</a>, students worked with <code>for each</code>, which is useful when you want to use each item of a list without changing that list or producing a new list. This lab focuses on three higher order list operations: <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>., two of which, <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> create new lists of data. These three list processing operations give enormous power all by themselves.  In combination, they allow very sophisticated data processing. Students will apply these tools various context including an overarching theme of list of lists to manage and organize yearbook data.</p>
        <p><code>Map</code> performs an operation on each item of a list and reports a modified list. That is, <code>map</code> takes a list as input and allows produces a new list in which each element of the input has been processed in some way: for example, doubled, or made plural, or replaced by a selection (from some other list) that it somehow indicated.</p>
        <p><code>Keep</code> filters a list and returns a list of all items from the orginal list that match a given requirement. That is, <strong>keep</strong> takes a list as input and creates a new list keeping only those items from the input list that match some criterion&mdash;like begins with a vowel, is even, is less than five characters long, or is a vegetable.</p> 
        <p><code>Combine</code> performs a binary (two-input) operation (such as addition) <em>with</em> every item of a list and returns a single result (such as the sum). That is, <strong>combine</strong> takes a list and an operation as input and reports the result of performing that binary operation between each of the items in the list (like addition, multiplication, and <code>join</code>, <code>combine</code> is <em>associative</em>). </p>

		<h3>Tips:</h3>
		<div>
        	<ul>
				<li>GS Problem 1b gives the result "NaN". This stands for "Not a Number" and results because the sum operation expects numbers as its inputs, and 3b has included a list as one of the inputs.</li>
        	</ul>
