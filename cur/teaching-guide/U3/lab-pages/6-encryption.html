		<h2>Social Implications Lab 6: Encryption</h2>
		<p>The details of encryption get complicated, but the overall idea is important. Bits about confidential information pass through the Internet just like any other bits. In order to keep information secret, we can use encryption, an idea that has been around for millenia. In this lab, students learn about encryption and decryption methods, both enabled by technology.</p>
        <p>Students also consider why encryption is considered an issue with social implications. They will engage in a debate activity in which they consider the viewpoints of governments, civil liberties groups, and businesses regarding the availability of encryption software. Students also have the opportunity to research an innovation that is affected by issues around encryption (there are lots of innovations to choose from). They will do some online research and respond to prompts taken from the AP Explore Task which they will do following Unit 4 in the course.</p> 
		
        <h3>Pacing:</h3>
        There are 5 pages in this lab. The last page, when students do research and respond to AP Explore Task prompt, will probably take several days, especially if students engage in peer review.
        <ul>
        	<li>20-25 minutes on Secrets</li>
            <li>20-30 minutes on Secret Keys</li>
            <li>40-45 minutes on Public Keys</li>
            <li>65-75 minutes on Who Cares About Encryption?</li>
            <li>110-120 minutes on Cryptography and Innovations</li>
        </ul>

		<h3>Prepare:</h3>
		<div>
            <ul>
				<li>As you do <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/openers.html#computingnews" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> with your students this week, look for news stories relating to issues of encryption. Highlight stories that might give students ideas for their reserach task at the end of the lab about innovations that need to transmit data securely.</li>
                <li>Students will read parts of <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=179" target="_blank">Chapter 5 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a>. Reading through the entire chapter will be helpful, especially to get a better understanding of the evolution of encryption methods and some details of public key encryption.</li>
                <li>Re-familiarize yourself with the requirements of the <a href="http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-performance-assessment.pdf" target="blank">AP Explore Task</a> (there are more requirements than just the prompts listed in this lab) so that you can address students' questions.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<h3>Students will:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Encode and decode simple messages by hand.</li>
                <li>Consider ways in which encrypting information on the Internet needs to be similar to or different from using ciphers to encode messages.</li>
                <li>Read parts of <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=179" target="_blank">Chapter 5 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a> to learn about the breakthrough of public key encryption.</li>
                <li>Do a debate activity about the availability of encryption software from the perspectives of governments, civil liberties groups, and businesses.</li>
                <li>Think of an innovation that uses or relates to cryptography in some way, conduct online research to gather information, and prepare written responses to AP Explore Task prompts.</li>
			</ul>
