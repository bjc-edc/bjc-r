		<h2>Lab 4: Building Data Visualization Tools</h2>
		<!--<div class="todo">This grapher <em>should</em>, when we revise, become the grapher used in the U4 analysis of Burger whatever.</div>-->
        
		<p>Students learn the value of data visualization in acquiring new information from data, and the iterative way in which new insight is learned from data processing. Students learn the concept behind large data sets, including necessary tools for working with and understanding large data, and the value of working with others in discovering insights from large data. </p>  
        
		<!--<p>It is easier to compare the efficiency of the two algorithms if we can visualize the data we get from timing experiments. In this lab, students create a general graphing program that plots data points on a screen whose dimensions (scale) they have determined themselves. They then work with a dataset on a classroom of 27 sixth-graders and isolate various data subsets to create graphs of height vs. weight, age vs. height, age vs. weight, etc.</p>
        <p>This graphing program also has the option of taking a function as input and producing its Cartesian graph. On the last page, students explore using the app to plot a function such as <span class="katex">-5 + (x-3)^2</span>.</p> 
        <p>
            The graphing app that students build differs from many traditional graphing programs in that it requires hovering the mouse over the stage to input the <span class="katex">x</span>-values into the function, produce the points of the graph, and plot them. This is done for two reasons, one pedagogical and one practical:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>pedagogical</strong>: inputting the <code>mouse x</code> value into the function to get the corresponding <span class="katex">y</span> values supports understanding both what this graphing app is doing and the underlying mathematics of functions (e.g. unlike the <code>Graph datapoints</code> procedure, which begins with a complete set of <span class="katex">x</span> and <span class="katex">y</span> coordinates, the <code>Graph function</code> procedure needs to <em>generate</em> <span class="katex">y</span> values based on <em>inputed</em> <span class="katex">x</span> values&mdash;this is known to be a challenge in understanding functions for beginning algebra students)</li>
                <li><strong>practical</strong>: this approach makes use of what students already know about programming (e.g. how to read the mouse location and how to adjust it based on the graph scale) rather than working through the complicated algorithm of making subdivisions necessary to get a consistent curve</li>
            </ol>
        </p>-->

								<li>Make sure that, at the end of the project, the students test the versatility of the data visualization tool they have created by inputting a new data set (at least the given <code>CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions per capita</code> data) and observing the bar graph adjust to the new information in terms of scaling, labels etc.  </li>
                                <li>The versatility of the general data visualization tool students create can demonstrate the great power of computing, so make sure that there is enough time at the end of the project for experimentation and reflection.</li>

				<li>Coming soon...</li>
			</ul-->
			<h4>Essential Understandings:</h4>
			<p>Students use their own graphing program to visualize data that they process to gain knowledge and insight about a situation (<strong>EU 3.1</strong>). They will later use it to visualize the data they get when they time their algorithms.</p>
<p>This lab builds toward this EU by having students develop a data graphing tool as a way to gain insight into information. Students are required to program a graphing app that plots arbitrary (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) data from a list and can also accept a function as input and graph the values taken by the function over a range of inputs.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>EU 3.1</strong> People use computer programs to process information to gain insight and knowledge.</li>
                <!--<li><strong>E U 3.2</strong> Computing facilitates exploration and the discovery of connections in information.</li>-->
            </ul>
			<h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
			<p>Students interpret and communicate the results of their data-processing by using appropriate visualizations, notations, and precise language (<strong>LO 3.1.3</strong>). </p>
			<ul>
				<!--<li><strong>L O 3.1.2</strong> Collaborate when processing information to gain insight and knowledge. [P6]</li>-->
