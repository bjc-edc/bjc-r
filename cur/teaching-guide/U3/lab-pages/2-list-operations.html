		<h2>Programming Lab 2: Three Key List Operations</h2>
		<p>This lab introduces students to the <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code> list blocks. <code>Map</code> performs an operation on each item of a list and reports a modified list. <code>Keep</code> filters a list and returns a list of all items from the orginal list that match a given requirement. <code>Combine</code> performs an operation (such as addition) <em>with</em> every item of a list and returns a single result (such as the sum).</p> 
        <div class="todo">In L1, students encountered FOR EACH, which is useful when you want to use each item of a list without changing that list or producing a new list. Snap! provides two powerful tools for processing lists in ways that create new lists of data.  This is the topical focus of Lab 2.  Students will apply these tools to their ongoing projects. (Obviously, this can’t be the description unless it’s true.  It’d be nice to make it true.)

MAP takes a list as input and allows you to produce a new list in which each element of the input has been processed in some way: for example, doubled, or made plural, or replaced by a selection (from some other list) that it somehow indicated. 

KEEP takes a list as input and lets you create a new list keeping only those items from the input list that match some criterion—like begins with a vowel, or is even, or is less than five characters long, or is a vegetable.  You need to write the predicate that does the checking, but then KEEP allows you to apply that predicate to each item in the input list and report the list of elements that make the predicate true.

COMBINE takes a list and operation as ….… blah

These three list processing operations give enormous power all by themselves.  In combination, they allow very sophisticated data processing. --PG</div>

        	<ul>
				<li>GS Problem 1b gives the result "NaN". This stands for "Not a Number" and results because the sum operation expects numbers as its inputs, and 3b has included a list as one of the inputs.</li>
