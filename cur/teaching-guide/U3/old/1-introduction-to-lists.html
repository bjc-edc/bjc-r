    	<h2>Programming Lab 1: Introduction to Lists</h2>
        <p>Computers manipulate data and return processed information to the user. Numbers, strings of characters (letters, numbers, symbols, etc.), and Boolean values (true, false) are some of the basic pieces of information. Often, these small pieces are arranged in more complex structures: <em>lists</em>, ordered sets of data.</p> 
		<p>A <code>list</code> is not just a collection (set) but also a collection <em>in a particular order</em> (this order is tracked by an <em>index number</em> for each item on the list). If it has any elements at all, it has a first element, a last element, and so on. A list can also be totally empty, with no elements; often that is the way we want to set up (<em>initialize</em>) a list before we add elements to it. The <code>length of</code> an empty list is 0.</p>
		<p>
			Lists are powerful. Databases are lists of lists of lists. Many operations can be performed on data in a list:
			<ul>
				<li>Functional programming:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Searching a list to see if it <code>contains</code> some element.</li>
                        <li>Creating new lists that <code>keep</code> only certain items from a list you started with.</li>
                        <li>You can create new lists with more or fewer elements than the list you have.</li>
                        <li>You can pick an <code>item</code> of a list by position or characteristic or just randomly. </li></ul></li>
                        <li>Imperative programming:<ul>
                        <li>Modifying lists to <code>add</code>, <code>delete</code>, or <code>replace</code> items, or to <code>insert</code> an item in a specific spot.</li>
                        <li>You can do something with each item of the list: you can process it in some way, or <code>for each</code> element of the list, you can display it in some way.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Students begin page 1, Shopping List App, by building a basic shopping list app that introduces the ideas that lists can store data and that programs can access and manipulate list contents. In its simplest form, the app allows the user to add items or clear the list. Students can add more features as they learn more about list processing. (In Lab 2, the same basic idea of maintaining a list is used in a contacts list app, in principle like the ones on phones. That app will be revisited and improved  later in the curriculum.)</p>
        <p>On page 2, Exploring List Processing, students explore various list blocks by predicting and testing the outcome of various expressions and small scripts. Students get a preview of several important procedures that will be addressed later in more detail (<code>for each</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>).</p>
        <p>Page 3, Modeling Sentence Structures, returns to  the theme of natural language processing, one element in artificial intelligence research.  Students use <strong>abstraction</strong> to build structures such as noun phrases out of random selections from lists of words of various categories. Sentence phrase blocks are combined to build simple and complex sentences.</p>
        <p>On page 4, Lists of Lists, students explore lists containing lists and access data within lists of lists using nested <code>item of</code> blocks and <code>all but first of</code>. These exercises can be adapted for assessment.</p>

                        <li>Opener: Present a short script in which a list is used without having first been initialized, resulting in an error. Ask students: What might have caused the error? What is the proper way to address this issue? </li>
                        <li>
	                      Discussion: You may wish to review different types of data in Snap<em>!</em>: strings, lists, Booleans, numbers, functions, etc. You might ask:
                            <ul>
                                <li>What is is the difference between a string and a list? (Students without prior programming experience may wonder, "what's <em>the same</em> between a string and a list?" The answer is that they're both aggregates. A string is an aggregate whose items are restricted to single characters; a list is an aggregate whose items can be anything.)</li>
                                
                                <li>What actions can you perform on a list? What can you use lists for? (Actions might be "add an item" or "order the items"; project ideas might be "track earnings and expenses" or "organize sports data.")</li>
                                <li>What data types can be list items? Invite students to experiment with Snap<em>!</em> to answer this question and to consider contexts for which including various data types in a list would be useful. (A list can contain <em>any</em> data type  <em>anywhere</em>. Students will have seen only a limited set of values at this point.)</li>
                                <li>Can you put a list in a list? (Yes, <em>any</em> data type <em>anywhere</em>.) What are some examples of a list within a list? (Students may not have examples just yet.) This is both a preview of the next lab, "Nesting Lists," and also an introduction to the idea that nesting computational objects is common in programming. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>Page 2: Exploring List Processing.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This page asks students to build the blocks (rather than providing a link that has the blocks built already). This is intentional, so that students get the experience of finding these blocks in the palette and getting the logic of what kinds of blocks go inside of other blocks.</li>
                        <li>Students explore blocks such as <code>all but the first of {}</code>, <code>() in front of {}</code>, and <code>item () of {}</code>. Consider asking students to write out a sentence describing the behavior of each of these blocks or to describe them to the class</li>
                        <li>Listen for students making the distinction between expressions that report strings (such as "Boise") and those that report a list containing one item (such as <code>{Boise}</code>). If you don't hear students making this distinction, consider a brief class discussion about it. Knowing what data type is reported is a big help when debugging.</li>
	                    <li>
                        	Discussion: After students have all had a chance to consider the problems on this page, you might ask:
                            <ul>
                                <li>What is the difference between <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/gs2item.png" class="script" alt="item 2 of list block" title="item 2 of list block"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/gs2list.png" class="script" alt="list with item 2 block" title="list with item 2 block">? This question is on the student lab page. Asking it again gives students a chance to refine their understanding that an item (e.g., Boise) is not the same as a <em>list</em> containing just that item.</li>
                                <li>Ask students to describe what each of these blocks does: <code>length</code>, <code>all but first</code>, <code>in front of</code>, <code>item</code>, <code>contains</code>.</li>
                                <li>Ask students to describe what each of these blocks does: <code>for each</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>,  <code>combine</code>. Students don't need to achieve mastery here. This is just a chance to spend a moment building some initial ideas about these functions before Lab 3: Three Key List Operations.</li>
                              <li>Ask students what they think each of these blocks does: <code>add</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>insert</code>, and <code>replace</code>. Students should get the chance to experiment to validate or correct their guesses. Unit 3 doesn't doesn't focus on these blocks, but students may want to know that they exist. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                	<strong>Page 3: Modeling Sentence Structures (Teacher's Choice).</strong> 
                	<ul>
                    	<li>The page is designed to offer a fun mini-project in which the use of lists feels natural and empowering. Encourage students to be creative and build other kinds of sentences or even simple conversations.</li>
                        <li>This lesson relies on proficiency in programming more than knowledge of English sentence structure. For this kind of project, English is particularly easy because it has hardly any inflections (case, tense, mood, etc.), but students may try this project in a language other than English, if they like. Languages present different challenges but students can adjust their lists or their coding to make the project work. Students could work with others or alone and then share. Be creative. For example, it might be beneficial to pair a student studying Spanish with a fluent Spanish speaker. </li>
                        <li>As always, if students do interesting work (e.g. with another language or with the Take It Further problems), consider inviting them to share with the class.</li>
		                <li>Discussion, you might ask: How do the sentence builder blocks demonstrate abstraction?</li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                	Lab 1 includes several mini-projects that students could spend additional time improving and turn in:
                	<ul>
                    	<li>The Shopping List App (on "Shopping List App")</li>
                        <li>The Sentence Builder (on "Modeling Sentence Structures")</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Additional Assessment Idea:

                        <li>Write a program that keeps track of all the locations that are clicked on the stage and stores them in a list as shown here. You should create your scripts for the stage (select the stage as opposed to a sprite when you create your scripts) and use the <code>mouse x</code> and <code>mouse y</code> reporter blocks from the sensing palette. </li>
                        <li>
                            <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" />
                            For students who have explored the <code>for each</code> block on the Page 2: Exploring List Processing&mdash;Add code under the sprite that responds to pressing the space bar. The sprite should play connect the dots, drawing the path specified by the points in the list. You should use <code>glide</code> from the move tray.
                        </li>

                <li>
                	<strong>Across Unit 3.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><div class="sidenote">Many of the <span class="snap">snap</span> projects linked from the student pages already have the tools imported.</div>
                        Students will have to <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" /> in order to access the blocks they need, every time they open a new <span class="snap">snap</span> window. (Links to projects in the curriculum have been shared with the tools already imported.)</li>
                        <li>The words "item" and "element" have the same meaning. We use "item" here because that's the name of the block that examines an item in a list. You may want to favor that word, too.</li>
                        <li>In Snap<em>!</em>, the first item of a list is considered item number 1, not number 0 as in some other languages. We think this is clearly advantageous for learners: "the third item" and "item 3" should refer to the same thing. Zero-origin list indexing is a leftover from low-level languages that do arithmetic on array indices. It's fine if some student thinks zero-origin is "right," but feel free also to say that one design goal of computer language is to be clear, and this language (Snap<em>!</em>) is designed so that ordinals (first, second, third) and cardinals (1, 2, 3)  match.</li>
                        <li>We are encouraging functional programming style, which in this case means favoring the list reporters over the list commands. Make sure that students understand, for example, that <code>all but first of</code> makes a new list; the original list given as its input is not modified.</li>
                        <li>One advantage of functional programming is that it avoids circular structures, which can be made by mutation:<br />
                          <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/circular.png" alt="replace item (3) of (foo) with (foo)" title="replace item (3) of (foo) with (foo)" /><br />This won't come up in the curriculum, but some students may try it anyway.  It won't break Snap<em>!</em>, but encourage such students to play with circularity on their own time.</li>
