            <p>This lab does not introduce new ideas, but gives students practice applying MAP, KEEP, and COMBINE in several contexts, in order to master the use of these powerful tools and to learn to think in terms of what they can do.</p> 
            <p>Lists of same-size lists can function as tables or matrices. Tic Tac Toe... Magic Squares gives students a game context in which to practice further their use of lists and list processing functions.</p> 
        </div>
        
		<p>Anything that can be handled by creating and manipulating a list can also be done without lists, just by working with the individual elements and keeping track of that process. But list processing—especially list processing with  the higher order functions <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code> (and, later in this course, recursion)—is powerful. It lets the programmer focus on the purpose and meaning of the program—what the program is intended to do—and not on tiny local details of how to do it, details that essentially reinvent  a clumsy equivalent of lists and ways to work sequentially through them.</p>
        <p>Becoming facile with list processing takes practice, and initially requires contexts in which the meaning of the lists and the purpose and meaning of the functions that process them are clear.  One subtlety of working with lists is that it requires thinking simultaneously about the list as a <em>single object</em> and, at the same time, recognizing that much of what one wants to do with the list involves processing some or all of the <em>elements</em> of the list. That is also part of the subtlety of the higher-order functions, which take an entire list as a single object and handle the individual elements of the list in various ways, as determined by the programmer. <em>Composing</em> higher order functions is yet more powerful, but also more challenging, because each one does so much that the programmer needs to picture large effects and the interactions of these large effects.</p>
        <p>This lab gives students practice applying <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>  in several contexts to build their facility with these powerful tools and to learn to think in terms of what they can do. It does not introduce new ideas, but focuses on mastery and application.</p>

                <li>
                    Assessment Idea: Write a program that allows a user to enter words and definitions.
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                            Create an abstract data type to hold each word definition:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Create a <code>word definition</code> <em>constructor</em> that accepts two inputs: the word and the definition (both as text strings).</li>
                                <li>Create two <em>selectors</em> <code>word</code> and <code>definition</code>.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Create a variable called <var>vocab list</var> that is a list of words and their definitions and that initializes when the green flag is clicked.</li>
                        <li>Make a way for a user to enter a word and its definition. Use <code>keep</code> to determine whether a new word is already in the list of words and provide an error message to the user if it is.</li>
                        <li>Make a way for the user to read all the words included in the dictionary. Use <code>map</code> to make the sprite say all the words separated by commas.</li>
                        <li>Make a way for the user to look up the definition of a word in the vocab list.</li>
                        <li>Submit your code in whatever way your class submits work.</li>

                        <li>Refining this game builds on students' understanding of lists and list operations including higher order functions. This is likely to feel very satisfying to students, a major accomplishment. It is!
