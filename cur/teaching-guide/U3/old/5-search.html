		<h2>Social Implications Lab 5: Search</h2>
		<p>Searching on the Internet may not, at first,seem to have many social implications. But as students learn about how search engines work, they might be surprised to learn what is included and, sometimes more importantly, excluded from the results. Students will also think about the information that search engines can collect about your searches, and the implications of how the search engines might use that data.</p>
        <p>Students will think about how <em>they</em> might design their own search engine. In doing so, they examine their own values and priorities. They can ask questions like: How important is privacy to me? What sources of information might be overlooked by the engineers who design these search engines at large companies? What phrases have special meaning to me that Yahoo or Google don't seem to know about? This activity asks students to think more deeply about search engines, and is meant also to demonstrate that students have valuable contributions to make.</p>
		

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
        <div>
            The 3 lab pages could be split across 3-4 days (<strong>120-180 minutes</strong>). The lab is expected to take less than a week, though this can change depending on how deeply students want to dive into designing their own search engine.
            <ul>
                <li>40-50 minutes on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-community/4-search-engines.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Search Engines</a></li>
                <li>40-50 minutes on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/old-search-internet/2-how-searching-works.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">How Searching Works</a></li>
                <li>40-80 minutes on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/old-search-internet/3-design-your-own.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Design Your Own Search Engine</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
            
        <h3>Prepare:</h3>
		<div>
            <ul>
				<li>As you do <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/openers.html#computingnews" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> with your students this week, you might also share with them the news sources you use and talk about how these sources are  affected by search criteria.</li>
                <li>Students will read parts of <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">Chapter 4 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a>. Reading through the entire chapter can help you bring up interesting points for students to consider during classroom discussions.
                <ul>
				<div class="sidenote">Students will learn more about the structure of the Internet in Unit 4.</div>
                	<li>For example, during discussions, you may get the sense that students are thinking about the organization of the Internet as a hierarchy, as in a library. Pages 117-120 can give you a way to talk about this idea with students.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If you're unfamiliar with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, you might take their tour and explore some of their features.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<h3>Students will:</h3>
        <div>
			<ul>
				<li>Examine some different search engines.</li>
                <li>Guess at how search engines might work (perhaps surfacing some misconceptions that can be addressed).</li>
                <li>Read parts of <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=127" target="_blank">Chapter 4 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a> to learn how search engines actually work.</li>
                <li>Either suggest improvements to an existing search engine or design a specialized search engine of their own. They will see how bias and preferences can show up in search engines and will explore ways to express their own interests and values in their own design.</li>
			</ul>
        </div>

        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 1: Search Engines.</strong>
                    There are several ways students can engage with this introduction.
                    <ul>
                        <li>By comparing different search engines, students might think of not only the order in which results appear, but the aesthetics of how the information is displayed.</li>
                        <li>Students can also try to "fool" the search engine. They can try to type in phrases that can have multiple meanings to see what shows up. Students might consider how search engines can reflect cultural biases.</li>
                        <li>The information about filter bubbles at <a href="http://dontbubble.us/" target="_blank">dontbubble.us (by DuckDuckGo)</a> gives one hint that search engines are not an objective representation of information on the Internet. This is one opportunity to talk about how the filtering of results has the potentially positive effect of tailoring your search results to reflect what you appear to care most about, but also has potentially negative effects of limiting the scope of information and opinions you think are out in the world, especially if you don't realize your search results are filtered.</li>
                        <li>Having students share their initial ideas of how search engines might work is meant to surface preconceptions and potential misconceptions students have about searching on the Internet. Students will likely also realize they've never really thought about how a search engine is able to access so much information on the Internet so quickly. Students will read about search engines on the next page, so there's no need to correct all the misconceptions now; it is enough to have students realize there's a dissonance between what they thought they knew and what must actually be happening.</li>
                        <li>Depending on the class discussion, students may not have any ideas of why searching has social implications. The quotes point to the idea that controlling information is powerful. This might be one idea that students might consider. If students don't have many ideas, it is okay to move on to other pages of the lab without fully diving into this question.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 2: How Searching Works.</strong>
                    <ul>
                    	<div class="sidenote">Students will pursue ideas for improving search engines further on the next page. Focus this lesson more on comprehension on how search engines work.</div>
                        <li>You might have students begin by thinking about what would happen if there were no search engines. How would they find information online?</li>
                        <li>The <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading is mostly about digesting information. As students read and make sense of the reading, emphasize the idea that search engines work based on some algorithm. It's a complicated algorithm, but every step in constructing the algorithm was a choice someone made about the search process. Ask students to consider some of these steps. The chapter broadly describes aspects of how a search engine ("Jen") gathers information. Can you think of ways to improve this process?</li>
                        <li>Students who don't seem engaged with "Design Your Own Search Engine"  might find it interesting to explore one of the Take It Further topics on "How Searching Works." There are many Take It Further questions on this page. Some ask students to reflect on what they learned and connect it to previous topics. Others raise issues that have important social implications, but, unfortunately, there likely isn't time to cover all these ideas.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>There are two options for this mini-project: improving an existing search engine, or designing a specialized search engine.</li>
                        <li>This is intended to be a creative opportunity. Encourage students to innovate and find ways to bring their personality, interests, and values into this task.</li>
                        <li>
                            The student page does not give any suggestions on how students should present this work. There are many options, including:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Students could write about different aspects of their design.</li>
                                <li>They could also create a short video about their ideas.</li>
                                <li>They might write a letter to a company with an existing search engine to suggest improvements.</li>
                                <li>They might create a storyboard or design board that displays their ideas, including mock-ups of their new design.</li>
                                <li>DuckDuckGo has a feature called <a href="http://duckduckhack.com/" target="_blank">DuckDuckHack</a> through which people can create or suggest "Instant Answers." The process is not trivial, but you may have a student who is interested in exploring this option.</li>
