		<h2>Lab 2: Data Representation and Compression</h2>
        <div class="todo">There is some old HTML commented out at the very end. If you go through it, please delete any you find unnecessary. --MF, 11/22/17</div>
		<p>This lab addresses the requirements of AP CSP Enduring Understanding 2.1.2, "Explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data." (It does not cover <em>hardware</em> abstraction levels.) The first page introduces binary representation as a place value system just like decimal representation, but with only two digits (0 and 1) instead of ten (0 through 9). The second page explains how a sequence of bits can represent information other than integers, and in particular explains floating point as an approximation for real numbers. The third page introduces hexadecimal representation, which uses sixteen digits (0-9 and A-F), building on students' understanding of binary. On the fourth page, students learn to translate between hex and binary and about the use of hex in RGB colors. The last page is an optional project in which students build a decimal-to-binary conversion procedure based on and reviewing their work with base 2 representation.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>There's no such thing as a "binary <em>number</em>" or a "hexadecimal <em>number</em>." </strong> The way we represent a number—as XXXI<sub>Roman</sub> or 31<sub>10</sub> or 11111<sub>2</sub> or 1F<sub>16</sub> or "thirty-one" or "treinta y uno"—is language or notation. The <em>number</em>, itself, is the same, regardless of what language we express it in. It helps the distinction to say "binary <em>numerals</em>" or "binary <em>representation</em>" instead of "binary numbers." Some curriculum materials are less careful. It's not just pedantry; students  understand the conversions better when they remain clearly aware that only the notation, not the <em>number,</em> changes. Explicitly making the analogy with Roman numerals may help; students are likely to understand and be able to extend from the idea XXXI and 31 are the same number written different ways.</li>
				<li>"Hexadecimal" is often abbreviated just to "hex." Either is fine to use generally, but students should recognize both.</li>

This is a different use of the word <em>binary</em> than in "binary sequences" or "binary representation." In "binary search," the word <em>binary</em> refers to splitting the list being searched into two parts.</li>

							<ul>
								<li>Don't teach hex arithmetic.  The goal is for students to become <em>familiar with the notation</em> of hex. Consider translating between representations for a few numbers together at the board.</li>
                                <li>Don't overemphasize number representations.  This is a popular topic because it's easy, but it doesn't call for deep understanding; hex is just a notation that people find convenient in a few computing contexts (<em>very</em> few, actually; RGB and IPv6 pretty much exhaust them).</li>
                                <li>Although base 16 is a base in its own right, it's <em>important</em> only as an abbreviation for the underlying binary. You don't necessarily have to say that to students, but don't allow a mystique to develop around hex.</li>

                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1D</strong> Number bases, including binary, decimal, and hexadecimal, are used to represent and investigate digital data.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1E</strong> At one of the lowest levels of abstraction, digital data is represented in binary (base 2) using only combinations of the digits zero and one.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1F</strong> Hexadecimal (base 16) is used to represent digital data because hexadecimal representation uses fewer digits than binary.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1G</strong> Numbers can be converted from any base to any other base.</li>

                <li><strong>EK 2.1.2B</strong> In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent characters or integers limits the range of integer values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in overflow or other errors.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.2C</strong> In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers (as floating point numbers) limits the range of floating point values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in round off and other errors.</li>

                <li><strong>EK 2.1.2E</strong> A sequence of bits may represent instructions or data.</li>

                    Students do not need to become proficient at converting among representations—not for the AP, not for careers in programming, not for anything—but some students find these notational changes interesting and may <em>like</em>  to play one or more of the following number representation games <em>on their own time</em>. The games (or any other focus on skill at conversion) should not become a distraction  from the essential content of the unit.

						<li>Along with clarifying the use of powers of two versus powers of ten for the place values, this page emphasizes the fact that there is a <em>unique</em> way to represent any positive integer as a sum of powers of two.</li>

                        <li>We want to make range limitations in computer arithmetic something that students can explore experimentally, so we start by having them write a factorial procedure, because that's a function that grows very quickly, so even for small inputs they can see the results of range limitations.</li>
                        <li>But we also want to emphasize that allowing human beings to see hardware limitations is a gross failure of abstraction, and that a good programming language doesn't allow that to happen. As the page explains, <em>people have died</em> because of integer overflow. Thus, for pedagogic purposes, Snap<em>!</em> can simulate both bad and good languages.</li>
                        <li>Snap<em>!</em> can simulate both bignum and non-bignum languages. You can use that to show that it is a failure of abstraction for computer languages to force users to think about and work around hardware limitations.</li>
