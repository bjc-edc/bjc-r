		<h2>Lab 2: Data Representation and Compression</h2>
		<p>This lab addresses representation of digital data as binary sequences. The first two pages introduce bits, bytes, and binary sequences and how they are used to store text, images, and other data. The following two pages explain how a binary sequence can represent numbers&mdash;both integers and non-integers&mdash;and in particular, explain floating point as an approximation for real numbers. These are followed by three pages covering two common number representations: binary and hexadecimal. Binary and hexadecimal (hex) are place value systems just like decimal representation; binary uses only two digits (0 and 1) instead of ten (0 through 9), and hexadecimal uses sixteen digits (0-9 and A-F). Students learn to translate between hex and binary and about the use of hex in RGB colors. The last page addresses data compression and the difference between lossy and lossless data compression formats, which lose and preserve original information respectively.</p>
        <p><strong>There's no such thing as a "binary <em>number</em>" or a "hexadecimal <em>number</em>." </strong> The way we represent a number—as XXXI<sub>Roman</sub> or 31<sub>10</sub> or 11111<sub>2</sub> or 1F<sub>16</sub> or "thirty-one" or "treinta y uno"—is language or notation. The <em>number</em>, itself, is the same, regardless of what language we express it in. It helps the distinction to say "binary <em>numerals</em>" or "binary <em>representation</em>" instead of "binary numbers." Some curriculum materials are less careful. It's not just pedantry; students  understand the conversions better when they remain clearly aware that only the notation, not the <em>number,</em> changes. Explicitly making the analogy with Roman numerals may help; students are likely to understand and be able to extend from the idea XXXI and 31 are the same number written different ways.</p>

	<h3>Lab Pages</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Page 1: Bits.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Understand that data is represented using bits.</li>
								<li>Understand that <em>n</em> bits are needed to represent 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> values.</li>
                            </ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Don't talk about "binary" on this page. Students should not be thinking about place value but only about questions such as "how many bits do you need to represent the colors of the rainbow?" or "how many bits do you need to represent the months of the year?"</li>
                                <li>
                                    Be sure students understand the tip in the orange box before moving on to exercise 7, "how many values can be represented in a 64-bit word?" Every ten bits of multiplies the number of possible values by about 1000; so 60 bits would offer a thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand (six of them) possible values, and the remaining four bits represent another factor of 16. If your students are already proficient with exponentials, they may not need this trick and can instead see that doubling from 32 to 64 bits <em>squares</em> the number of values, so the answer is about 4 billion squared or 16 billion billion (16 quintillion).
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Instead of trying to make sense of thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand, they can just count off six thousand-group names: thousand, million, billion, trillion, quadrillion, quintillion.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>The student page says that 8-bit bytes are used mainly to represent text characters, and that's true, but for representing emoji, mathematics, and languages with accents or ideograms, more than one byte per character may be required. These details are presented as optional reading hidden in a yellow box between problems 9 and 10.</li>

					<strong>Page 2: Binary Sequences.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>Understand that the meaning of a string of bits depends on the context in which it is used.</li>
                            </ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This page uses the phrase "binary sequences" as a technical term, but otherwise doesn't talk about binary. </li>
                                <li>Students may reasonably ask, "Is a kilobyte 1000 bytes, or 1024 bytes?" This turns out to be a complicated question: If we're talking about the RAM, a kilobyte is 1024 bytes, but if we're talking about a disk, it's 1000 bytes. In an attempt to resolve this ambiguity, the International Electrotechnical Commission has introduced new metric-ish names for the powers of two wherein 1024 bytes a "kibibyte" or KiB. These new power-of-two names all have "bi" replacing the second syllable of the metric name: kibi, mebi, gibi, tebi, pebi, etc. This is covered in the edX BJC video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x1hMBT3hkU&index=4&list=PLno6_GYnQv_SOQ7nFjItIdn0Xa9IV4VmH" target="_blank">Data: Data and Information Part 3</a>, but you needn't go into any of this with students unless someone asks.</li>

					<strong>Page 3: Representing Whole Numbers.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>Understand that the choice of representation has implications for the kinds of numbers that can be stored and how precisely they can be stored. </li>
                                <li>Understand that the standard mechanism of storing numbers, fixed width representation, limitations the size of a number. </li>
                                <li>Understand that fixed width representation has killed people and that better representations (such as bignums) are available.</li>

                        <div class="todo">Brian and Mary stopped here. --MF, 12/14/17</div>
		
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
<div class="comment">	Why this?  There isn't that much text on the page. --bh							<li>You might have students take turns reading, or you might have all students read a section silently and then ask one or two summarize out loud.</li><p>It's likely left-over from an old version, but it does seem useful for perhaps a page like 6.1.6 or even to include near the beginning in the the L1 TG. Someone should move it somewhere useful and remove this comment. --MF, 12/6/17</p></div>
                                <div class="todo">Do we need this? It's on the student page already and the page is <em>called</em> Representing Whole Numbers. --MF, 12/14/17<br />
		<li>We discuss only nonnegative integers, except to say that half the integers are negative so the maximum value in a single word is 2<sup>63</sup> rather than 2<sup>64</sup>.          </li></div>
                                <li>Note the different meanigs of the word binary. The question "What's the <em>first</em> integer whose factorial doesn't fit in a word?" can be answered by binary search, which students learned in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/2-improving-search.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 5 Lab 1: Analyzing and Improving Searches</a>, between 20 (known to fit) and 30 (known not to fit). This is a different use of the word <em>binary</em> from the use in "binary sequences" or "binary representation." In "binary search," the word <em>binary</em> refers to splitting the range being searched into two equal parts.</li>

						</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Discussion:</strong> After students work through the lab page, you might review by asking, "Why did Snap<em>!</em> display <code>20!</code> in ordinary, whole number representation but <code>30!</code> in scientific notation?"
                            <!--<li>Why can't programming languages just use more than one word if necessary to represent an integer?</li>-->

					<strong>Page 4: Floating Point.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>Understand that floating point is a representation for storing numbers that is analogous to scientific notation. </li>
                                <li>Understand that by default, if a whole number is above a certain size, it will be stored as a floating point value and therefore be rounded. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This page includes rational numbers. In case it comes up, note that any rational number can be represented exactly as a fraction (a pair of integers, e.g., 1/3), but irrational numbers cannot.</li>
								<li>You don't have to say this to students, but knowing it may help you answer their questions: Since the floating point format has a finite number of bits, and since irrational numbers require infinitely many digits, <em>every</em> representable number is rational. Irrational numbers can only be approximated in floating point. (The converse isn't true: Not every rational number is representable.)</li>
                        		<li>We explain that other data types, including lists, are represented as binary sequences, but we do not introduce the idea of pointers to memory addresses.</li>
							<div class="todo">Moved from L1. --MF, 12/14/17 <li>Another example in the lab is that high level languages associate data types with values, whereas low level languages associate data types with variables. (That is, if your language makes you say <code>int i</code> or <code>float x</code>, it's a low-level language.) One reason is that in a language with dynamic typing (the high level kind) it's just as easy to make a list whose items are of different data types as to make one whose items are all integers, or all character strings. </li>

							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Don't teach hex arithmetic.  The goal is for students to become <em>familiar with the notation</em> of hex. Consider translating between representations for a few numbers together at the board.</li>
                                <li>Don't overemphasize number representations.  This is a popular topic because it's easy, but it doesn't call for deep understanding; hex is just a notation that people find convenient in a few computing contexts (<em>very</em> few, actually; RGB and IPv6 pretty much exhaust them).</li>
                                <li>Although base 16 is a base in its own right, it's <em>important</em> only as an abbreviation for the underlying binary. You don't necessarily have to say that to students, but don't allow a mystique to develop around hex.</li>

								<li>
                                	If you want to present a similarly simple algorithm for lossy compression, consider reducing the set of possible colors by restricting each of red, green, and blue to the (hexadecimal) values 00, 11, 22, ... dd, ee, and ff, so that <span style="background:#d62">cinnamon would be rounded to dd6622, and then stored in files as d62.</span> (Browsers actually do accept these three-hex-digit color codes.) Each color number would then take two bytes (including transparency) instead of four. You can see that that color is a little closer to orange than <span style="background:#d2691e">the real cinnamon (d2691e)</span> is, but this restriction is hardly noticeable in real pictures:<br />

			<h4>Enduring Understandings:</h4>
            <div class="comment">This EU paragraph are modifications of those from 4.3 in the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/resources/BJC-Curriculum-Outline.pdf" target="_blank">2016 Curriculum Outline</a>. The LO paragraph is completely new for 2017. --MF, 12/1/17</div>
            <p>Students learn about the abstractions that are value representations and translate among binary, decimal, and hexadecimal notation (<strong>EU 2.1</strong>). This lab builds toward hits EU by focusing on ideas of binary data, sequences, and representation. The lab offers explanation of floating point, binary and hexadecimal representation, and the use of HEX in RGB color. The lab also requires students to explore factorial outputs both with and without bignums to convert between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal representation.</p>
            <ul>
				<li><strong>EU 2.1</strong> A variety of abstractions built on binary sequences can be used to represent all digital data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
            <p>Students have been using procedural abstraction since the beginning of the year and abstract data types since Unit 2. Here, after talking about some bit-level abstractions, students reflect on the similarities and differences between high-level and low-level abstractions (<strong>LO 2.1.1</strong>). After learning about binary representations for numbers, text strings, and colors, students are asked to compare the virtues of hex RGB codes vs. browser color names in terms of space required and usability (<strong>LO 2.1.2</strong>).</p>
            <ul>
				<li><strong>LO 2.1.1</strong> Describe the variety of abstractions used to represent data. [P3]</li>
				<li><strong>LO 2.1.2</strong> Explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data. [P5]</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Essential Knowledge:</h4>
			<ul>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1A</strong> Digital data is represented by abstractions at different levels.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1B</strong> At the lowest level, all digital data are represented by bits.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1C</strong> At a higher level, bits are grouped to represent abstractions, including but not limited to numbers, characters, and color.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1D</strong> Number bases, including binary, decimal, and hexadecimal, are used to represent and investigate digital data.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1E</strong> At one of the lowest levels of abstraction, digital data is represented in binary (base 2) using only combinations of the digits zero and one.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1F</strong> Hexadecimal (base 16) is used to represent digital data because hexadecimal representation uses fewer digits than binary.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1G</strong> Numbers can be converted from any base to any other base.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.2A</strong> A finite representation is used to model the infinite mathematical concept of a number. </li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.2B</strong> In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent characters or integers limits the range of integer values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in overflow or other errors.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.2C</strong> In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers (as floating point numbers) limits the range of floating point values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in round off and other errors.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.2D</strong> The interpretation of a binary sequence depends on how it is used.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.2E</strong> A sequence of bits may represent instructions or data.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.2F</strong> A sequence of bits may represent different types of data in different contexts.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.2.3K</strong> Lower-level abstractions can be combined to make higher level abstractions, such as short message services (SMS) or email messages, images, audio files, and videos.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 3.3.1C</strong> There are trade offs in using lossy and lossless compression techniques for storing and transmitting data.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 3.3.1D</strong> Lossless data compression reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted but allows complete reconstruction of the original data.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 3.3.1E</strong> Lossy data compression can significantly reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted at the cost of being able to reconstruct only an approximation of the original data.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.5.1A</strong> Numbers and numerical concepts are fundamental to programming.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.5.1B</strong> Integers may be constrained in the maximum and minimum values that can be represented in a program because of storage limitations.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.5.1E</strong> Logical concepts and Boolean algebra are fundamental to programming.</li>

                    Students do not need to become proficient at converting among representations—not for the AP, not for careers in programming, not for anything—but some students find these notational changes interesting and may <em>like</em>  to play one or more of the following number representation games <em>on their own time</em>. The games (or any other focus on skill at conversion) should not become a distraction  from the essential content of the unit.

						<li>Along with clarifying the use of powers of two versus powers of ten for the place values, this page emphasizes the fact that there is a <em>unique</em> way to represent any positive integer as a sum of powers of two.</li>

                        <li>We want to make range limitations in computer arithmetic something that students can explore experimentally, so we start by having them write a factorial procedure, because that's a function that grows very quickly, so even for small inputs they can see the results of range limitations.</li>
                        <li>But we also want to emphasize that allowing human beings to see hardware limitations is a gross failure of abstraction, and that a good programming language doesn't allow that to happen. As the page explains, <em>people have died</em> because of integer overflow. Thus, for pedagogic purposes, Snap<em>!</em> can simulate both bad and good languages.</li>
                        <li>Snap<em>!</em> can simulate both bignum and non-bignum languages. You can use that to show that it is a failure of abstraction for computer languages to force users to think about and work around hardware limitations.</li>
