		<h2>Lab 2: Data Representation and Compression</h2>
        <div class="todo">There is some old HTML commented out at the very end. If you go through it, please delete any you find unnecessary. --MF, 11/22/17</div>
		<p>This lab addresses the requirements of AP CSP Enduring Understanding 2.1.2, "Explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data." (It does not cover <em>hardware</em> abstraction levels.) The first page introduces binary representation as a place value system just like decimal representation, but with only two digits (0 and 1) instead of ten (0 through 9). The second page explains how a sequence of bits can represent information other than integers, and in particular explains floating point as an approximation for real numbers. The third page introduces hexadecimal representation, which uses sixteen digits (0-9 and A-F), building on students' understanding of binary. On the fourth page, students learn to translate between hex and binary and about the use of hex in RGB colors. The last page is an optional project in which students build a decimal-to-binary conversion procedure based on and reviewing their work with base 2 representation.</p>

        <h3>Prepare</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>There's no such thing as a "binary <em>number</em>" or a "hexadecimal <em>number</em>." </strong> The way we represent a number—as XXXI<sub>Roman</sub> or 31<sub>10</sub> or 11111<sub>2</sub> or 1F<sub>16</sub> or "thirty-one" or "treinta y uno"—is language or notation. The <em>number</em>, itself, is the same, regardless of what language we express it in. It helps the distinction to say "binary <em>numerals</em>" or "binary <em>representation</em>" instead of "binary numbers." Some curriculum materials are less careful. It's not just pedantry; students  understand the conversions better when they remain clearly aware that only the notation, not the <em>number,</em> changes. Explicitly making the analogy with Roman numerals may help; students are likely to understand and be able to extend from the idea XXXI and 31 are the same number written different ways.</li>
				<li>"Hexadecimal" is often abbreviated just to "hex." Either is fine to use generally, but students should recognize both.</li>

		<h3>Lab Pages</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Page 1: Bits.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Understand that data is represented using bits.</li>
								<li>Understand that <em>n</em> bits are needed to represent 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> values.</li>
                            </ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>It's deliberate that the word &quot;binary&quot; doesn't appear on this page. We talk about binary two pages later, when we first discuss the representation of numbers. On <em>this</em> page, we don't want students thinking about place value, etc., only about questions such as &quot;how many bits do you need to represent the colors of the rainbow?&quot; or &quot;how many bits do you need to represent the months of the year?&quot;</li>
								<li>Problem 7: If 32 bits can represent 4 billion values, how many can 64 bits represent? 
								  <ul>
								    <li>If your students have studied logs and exponentials, they should quickly see that doubling the number of bits <em>squares</em> the number of values, so 16 billion billion, or 16 quintillion. </li>
								    <li>If not, then it will really help them a lot to learn the trick in the orange box: every ten bits multiplies the number of values by 1000, so 60 bits would be a thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand (six of them), and the remaining four bits represent another factor of 16.
								      <ul>
								        <li>They can just count off six thousand-group names: thousand, million, billion, trillion, quadrillion, quintillion.</li>
							          </ul>
								    </li>
							      </ul>
								</li>
								<li>We say 8-bit bytes are used mainly to represent text characters, and that's true, but it's <em>not</em> quite true that one character is one byte. That's true for English speakers who aren't interested in emoji or mathematics, but strange characters, and also the alphabet in a language with accents or ideograms, may require more than one byte per character.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
                <li>
					<strong>Page 2: Binary Sequences.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>Understand that the meaning of a string of bits depends on the context in which it is used.</li>
                            </ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>We use the phrase &quot;binary sequences&quot; because the AP requires it, but otherwise we are still avoiding talking about binary.</li>
								<li>Is a kilobyte 1000 bytes, or 1024 bytes? This turns out to be a complicated question: If we're talking about the computer's main memory, it's 1024 bytes, but if we're talking about a disk, it's 1000 bytes. To try to resolve this ambiguity, the standards people have introduced new metric-ish names for the powers of two, so we're supposed to call 1024 bytes a &quot;kibibyte&quot; or KiB. The power-of-two names all have &quot;bi&quot; replacing the second syllable of the metric name: kibi, mebi, gibi, tebi, pebi, etc. You needn't go into this with kids, but in case a kid asks, that's the story.</li>

					<strong>Page 3: Representing Whole Numbers.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>Understand that the choice of representation has implications for the kinds of numbers that can be stored and how precisely they can be stored. </li>
                                <li>Understand that the standard mechanism of storing numbers has limitations on the size of the number. </li>
                                <li>Understand that the standard mechanism of storing numbers isn't very good, and has in fact killed people, because of those needless limitations.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
<div class="comment">	Why this?  There isn't that much text on the page. --bh							<li>You might have students take turns reading, or you might have all students read a section silently and then ask one or two summarize out loud.</li><p>It's likely left-over from an old version, but it does seem useful for perhaps a page like 6.1.6 or even to include near the beginning in the the L1 TG. Someone should move it somewhere useful and remove this comment. --MF, 12/6/17</p></div>
                                <li>We discuss only nonnegative integers, except to say that half the integers are negative so the maximum value in a single word is 2<sup>63</sup> rather than 2<sup>64</sup>.          </li>
                                <li>Discussion: After students work through the lab page, you might use this question to review:
  <ul>
    <li>Why did Snap<em>!</em> display <code>20!</code> in ordinary, whole number representation but <code>30!</code> in scientific notation?</li>
    <!--<li>Why can't programming languages just use more than one word if necessary to represent an integer?</li>-->
  </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>The question "What's the <em>first</em> integer whose factorial doesn't fit in a word?" can be answered by binary search, which students learned in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/2-improving-search.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 5 Lab 1: Analyzing and Improving Searches</a>, between 20 (known to fit) and 30 (known not to fit). This is a different use of the word <em>binary</em> from the use in "binary sequences" or "binary representation." In "binary search," the word <em>binary</em> refers to splitting the range being searched into two equal parts.</li>

                <li>
					<strong>Page 4: Floating Point.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>Understand that floating point is a representation for storing numbers that is analogous to scientific notation. </li>
                                <li>Understand that by default, if a whole number is above a certain size, it will be stored as a floating point value and therefore be rounded. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This page includes rational numbers. In case it comes up, note that any rational number can be represented exactly as a fraction (a pair of integers, e.g., 1/3), but irrational numbers cannot.</li>
								<li>You don't have to say this to students, but knowing it may help you answer their questions: Since the floating point format has a finite number of bits, and since irrational numbers require infinitely many digits, <em>every</em> representable number is rational. Irrational numbers can only be approximated in floating point. (The converse isn't true: Not every rational number is representable.)</li>
                        		<li>We explain that other data types, including lists, are represented as binary sequences, but we do not introduce the idea of pointers to memory addresses.</li>

							<strong>Tips:</strong>

								<li>Don't teach hex arithmetic.  The goal is for students to become <em>familiar with the notation</em> of hex. Consider translating between representations for a few numbers together at the board.</li>
                                <li>Don't overemphasize number representations.  This is a popular topic because it's easy, but it doesn't call for deep understanding; hex is just a notation that people find convenient in a few computing contexts (<em>very</em> few, actually; RGB and IPv6 pretty much exhaust them).</li>
                                <li>Although base 16 is a base in its own right, it's <em>important</em> only as an abbreviation for the underlying binary. You don't necessarily have to say that to students, but don't allow a mystique to develop around hex.</li>

                                	If you want to present a similarly simple algorithm for lossy compression, consider reducing the set of possible colors by restricting each of red, green, and blue to the (hexadecimal) values 00, 11, 22, ... dd, ee, and ff, so that <span style="background:#d62">cinnamon would be rounded to dd6622, and then stored in files as d62.</span> (Browsers actually do accept these three-hex-digit color codes.) Each color number would then take two bytes (including transparency) instead of four. You can see that that color is a little closer to orange than <span style="background:#d2691e">the real cinnamon (d2691e)</span> is, but this restriction is hardly noticeable in real pictures:<br />

            <div class="comment">This EU paragraph are modifications of those from 4.3 in the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/resources/BJC-Curriculum-Outline.pdf" target="_blank">2016 Curriculum Outline</a>. The LO paragraph is completely new for 2017. --MF, 12/1/17</div>
            <p>Students learn about the abstractions that are value representations and translate among binary, decimal, and hexadecimal notation (<strong>EU 2.1</strong>). This lab builds toward hits EU by focusing on ideas of binary data, sequences, and representation. The lab offers explanation of floating point, binary and hexadecimal representation, and the use of HEX in RGB color. The lab also requires students to explore factorial outputs both with and without bignums to convert between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal representation.</p>
            <ul>
				<li><strong>EU 2.1</strong> A variety of abstractions built on binary sequences can be used to represent all digital data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
            <p>Students have been using procedural abstraction since the beginning of the year and abstract data types since Unit 2. Here, after talking about some bit-level abstractions, students reflect on the similarities and differences between high-level and low-level abstractions (<strong>LO 2.1.1</strong>). After learning about binary representations for numbers, text strings, and colors, students are asked to compare the virtues of hex RGB codes vs. browser color names in terms of space required and usability (<strong>LO 2.1.2</strong>).</p>
            <ul>
				<li><strong>LO 2.1.1</strong> Describe the variety of abstractions used to represent data. [P3]</li>
				<li><strong>LO 2.1.2</strong> Explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data. [P5]</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Essential Knowledge:</h4>
			<ul>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1A</strong> Digital data is represented by abstractions at different levels.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1B</strong> At the lowest level, all digital data are represented by bits.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1C</strong> At a higher level, bits are grouped to represent abstractions, including but not limited to numbers, characters, and color.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1D</strong> Number bases, including binary, decimal, and hexadecimal, are used to represent and investigate digital data.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1E</strong> At one of the lowest levels of abstraction, digital data is represented in binary (base 2) using only combinations of the digits zero and one.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1F</strong> Hexadecimal (base 16) is used to represent digital data because hexadecimal representation uses fewer digits than binary.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1G</strong> Numbers can be converted from any base to any other base.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.2A</strong> A finite representation is used to model the infinite mathematical concept of a number. </li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.2B</strong> In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent characters or integers limits the range of integer values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in overflow or other errors.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.2C</strong> In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers (as floating point numbers) limits the range of floating point values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in round off and other errors.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.2D</strong> The interpretation of a binary sequence depends on how it is used.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.2E</strong> A sequence of bits may represent instructions or data.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.2F</strong> A sequence of bits may represent different types of data in different contexts.</li>

                    Students do not need to become proficient at converting among representations—not for the AP, not for careers in programming, not for anything—but some students find these notational changes interesting and may <em>like</em>  to play one or more of the following number representation games <em>on their own time</em>. The games (or any other focus on skill at conversion) should not become a distraction  from the essential content of the unit.

						<li>Along with clarifying the use of powers of two versus powers of ten for the place values, this page emphasizes the fact that there is a <em>unique</em> way to represent any positive integer as a sum of powers of two.</li>

					<ul>
                        <li>We want to make range limitations in computer arithmetic something that students can explore experimentally, so we start by having them write a factorial procedure, because that's a function that grows very quickly, so even for small inputs they can see the results of range limitations.</li>
                        <li>But we also want to emphasize that allowing human beings to see hardware limitations is a gross failure of abstraction, and that a good programming language doesn't allow that to happen. As the page explains, <em>people have died</em> because of integer overflow. Thus, for pedagogic purposes, Snap<em>!</em> can simulate both bad and good languages.</li>
                        <li>Snap<em>!</em> can simulate both bignum and non-bignum languages. You can use that to show that it is a failure of abstraction for computer languages to force users to think about and work around hardware limitations.</li>
