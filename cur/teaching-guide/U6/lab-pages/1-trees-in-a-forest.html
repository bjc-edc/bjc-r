		<h2>Programming Lab 1: Trees in a Forest</h2>
        <p>Recursion is the use of a procedure within itself. That definition is simple enough, but <em>using recursion</em> takes some practice and learning it well requires care in the order in which ideas are presented.</p>
        <p><img class="imageRight noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/full-recursive-tree-BYOB.jpg" alt="picture of tree" title="picture of tree" />Unit 5 introduces recursion in the context fractal graphics, i.e., pictures that include smaller versions of themselves.  The canonical example is the fractal tree, in which each branch is a smaller sub-tree with branches of its own.</p>
		<p>Most of this lab walks the students through a simple fractal tree using the <em>combining method</em> of explaining recursion.  This appraoch helps students overcome the feeling that a recursive call is "cheating" because it's calling a block that hasn't been fully written yet. To avoid this confusion, we start with a sequence of simpler (non-recursive) tree blocks, each of which calls the one before it (e.g., <code>tree2</code> calls <code>tree1</code>; <code>tree3</code> calls <code>tree2</code>; and so on.) </p>
		<p>
            A more traditional approach to teaching recursion would start with <em>tail recursion,</em> in which the sole recursive call comes at the tail end, like this:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/recursive-square.png" width="258" height="213" alt="tail recursive square block">
        </p>
        <p>However, students often misunderstand this code, thinking that the recursive call to <code>square</code> at the end means "go back to the beginning." This wrong mental model will work for tail recursive blocks, but when students confront a recursive call that can't be at the end of the definition, they'll be lost. The combining method, where students build up successive calls to similar procedures and then just call the procedure itself, provides a better introduction.</p>
        <p>Note that while most of the labs in other units provide links to projects with the blocks partly or completely pre-written, this lab does not because students need the tactile experience of building almost the same script repeatedly in order to see the virtue of combining them into a single script using recursion.</p>

		<h3>As a Class:</h3>
		<div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                	<strong>Before starting the lab pages:</strong>
                	<p>This unit begins with a teacher demonstration because the collective "gasp!" when the first complex picture appears is unforgettable. VEE is a great introduction to recursion because its use of randomness lets you ignore completely the annoying detail of base cases in recursive code. Students who've seen the demo, therefore, aren't ready to write their own recursive programs, but they're motivated to work through the first lab.</p>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Before students get started, project Snap<em>!</em>, choose "Open..." from the File menu, and select "Vee" from the list of example projects.</li>
                        <li>Click the green flag several times and ask students to <strong>describe what the <code>vee</code> procedure does</strong>. You may even choose to show the block definition and discuss how the steps of the procedure generate the images that appear.</li>
                        <li>Then ask students, "<strong>What will happen if we add <code>vee</code> to the list of shapes to make <code>vee</code> call itself?</strong>" You will likely hear answers such as "We'll  sometimes get another v-shape on one of the ends."</li>
                        <li>Then press the up arrow to add two instances of <code>vee</code> to the list, expand the list watcher so students can see the content, and click the green flag a few more times, stopping after the first significantly complex image appears. Ask students, "<strong>What happened when the <code>vee</code> block called itself?</strong>" Don't worry about getting to a precise answer here; the idea is just to instill a sense of the power behind the simple process of calling a procedure from within itself.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img class="imageRight noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/list-of-shape-blocks.jpg" alt="list of shape blocks" title="list of shape blocks" />
                    <p>Note that the <em>list of blocks</em> in the corner of the stage (shown right)	 is something the students won't have seen before, but resist the temptation to talk about it. Students will come to understand it by themselves because they've seen lists before and they've seen blocks before.</p>

                <li>
                    Discussion Questions:
                    <ul>
                    	<li>What is state transparency? Why is it important? Have you run in to issues with state transparency before? What happened and how did you resolve it?</li>
                        <li>These questions encourage students to attend very closely to the details of what how the trees are drawn?
                        	<ul>
                            	<li>Why are we multiplying size by 0.65 and 0.85? Why are we multiplying size by -1?</li>
                        		<li>Why are we turning 25&deg; CCW and then 60 &deg; CW and then 35 &deg; CCW?</li>
                            </ul>
                       </li>
                    </ul>
