		<h2>Lab 3: History and Impact of Computers</h2>
		<p>This lab is intended to give your class a break from the regular work routine while getting a glimpse at how computing is impacting the world.  Dan Garcia, the BJC edX instructor from UC Berkeley, talks about many fascinating issues, providing interesting examples and anecdotes.</p>

					<strong>Page 1: A Timeline of Computers.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Many young people think computers started in the 1980s with the Apple II and the IBM PC. (<em>Really</em> young people may think computers started with the iPhone.) The overarching point of this page is that people have been making machines to help them compute just about as long as there have been human beings. (But it <em>is</em> true that the timeline gets crowded starting in the 1960s.)</li>
								<li>We ask &quot;when was the first computer&quot; as a motivation for the page, and there <em>are</em> many possible answers, but one of them is the most important; don't leave this page before students understand what a stroke of genius Babbage's Analytical Engine was: the complete concept of programs and a programming language, with conditionals and loops, long before the low-level enabling technology (first relays in the 1930s, then vacuum tubes, then finally transistors) was available.
								  <ul>
								    <li>To make sure this point is clear: Long before Babbage there were machines that performed computations, but they had <em>one particular</em> computation built in, or at best (as in Babbage's Difference Engine) a particular family of computations, with a particular one selected by rearranging parts of the hardware. What was required for the modern idea of a computer was the idea of a computer <em>program,</em> as a kind of data, just like numbers, but with codes telling the machine what to do next. &quot;Program as data&quot; may seem like an esoteric idea when it's encountered in the form of higher order functions, but without that idea there couldn't be programmable computers at all.</li>
							      </ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>First just let students click around the timeline on whatever tickles their fancy.</li>
								<li>Then read with them the entries about Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and Alan Turing. These are the patron saints of computer science. Babbage and Lovelace had little <em>practical</em> effect because it's just not possible to build a serious computer out of gears and cranks, but between them they had most of the crucial ideas of modern computing. Turing's work was of course tremendously practical. It's an exaggeration that he won World War II by himself; there were <div class="todo">ST-Some? Not millions?</div>some soldiers involved, and a whole team of mathematicians (many of them women, as in the early days at NASA) working with him. And a team in Poland cracked a simpler version of the Enigma years earlier. But his work was crucial.</li>
								<li>Students met Turing in Unit 5, because of the halting theorem. You'll want to remind them of that, if they don't make the connection themselves.</li>
								<li>Much of this information comes from Wikipedia, and we debated providing links to the articles in the timeline. But Wikipedia is hard reading, and may give more detail than students will want. Consider suggesting to the most interested students that they follow up on a topic by searching Wikipedia for it.</li>
								<li>There are opportunities here for students to pursue a topic in as much depth as they choose. Just for example, a student might want to learn to do arithmetic on an abacus. It's fun, but it does require a certain amount of memorization. (It's also possible that some of your students already know how. If a student volunteers to demonstrate, by all means make time for that. <div class="todo">ST-This feels wrong to me.  Why just Asians mentioned?  How about Middle Eastern students etc?</div>But beware of requiring Asian students to represent their culture of origin; some will be trying hard to be as American as possible.)</li>

							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Gain insight on how technology is impacting human communication and collaboration in a vast range of fields from commerce to entertainment to health care.</li>
								<li>Learn about the ways in which citizenship and citizen participation are being redefined in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</li>
                                <li>Catch a glimpse as to how progress in machine learning and data-mining is expanding the horizons of human innovation.</li>
                                <li>Consider the economic, social and cultural implications of technology. </li>
                                <li>Become aware of the issues around intellectual property in the modern era.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>You can have the students watch these videos together as a class or assign as homework.</li>
								<li>The AP CSP exam has many questions about the global impact of computing so be sure that students take this lab seriously despite its more relaxed format.</li>
                                <li>Be sure to have some discussion on the issues raised by the videos.</li>
                                <li>If the pace of these videos is ever too fast for your students or yourself, you can use the "speed" feature of YouTube (at the settings menu) to adjust the pace. (75% seems to be just about right.)</li>
