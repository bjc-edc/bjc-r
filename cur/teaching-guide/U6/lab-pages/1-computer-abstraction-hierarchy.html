		<h3>Prepare</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Although this is not mentioned in the student materials to avoid forcing teachers' hands, the very best way to begin this unit is to have students in groups take apart an actual physical computer.  (Preferably, you'll have one old computer per four students or so, but even if it's just one computer with the whole class watching, it's still a great activity.) It doesn't have to be a <em>working</em> computer, although if it is, so much the better; the thrill when they put it back together and it still works is fantastically motivating. Since it's generally no longer legal to dump old computers in the garbage because of toxic materials, nonworking computers can often be obtained free from the local recycling center. Working but antique computers (i.e., more than ten years old) can be bought very cheaply at used computer stores, or also at the recycling center if you're lucky. If you're <em>very</em> lucky, your school will decide to buy new computers, and you can grab bunches of old ones before they leave the building.</li>
				<li><a href="ifixit.com">ifixit.com</a> is one good source of teardown guides, such as this example: <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Compaq+Deskpro+EN+Teardown/55804">https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Compaq+Deskpro+EN+Teardown/55804</a>You can perhaps find one specifically for the particular model of old computer you salvaged. It doesn't have to be on their site; just do a web search for your computer model and the word &quot;teardown.&quot;</li>
				<li>What follows is a list of things not to do, but don't let the list scare you away from the activity.</li>
			  <li><em><strong>Do not tear down a laptop</strong></em> the first time you try this activity. Laptops are very dense, and parts are often held together with glue. People do tear down laptops and even get them working again, but get some experience with desktop/tower computers first. Also, laptop batteries have been known to catch fire.</li>
			  <li><em><strong>Do not tear down a cell phone in class ever.</strong></em> Besides sharing all the problems of laptops, they have highly explosive and flammable batteries. People do tear them down, and put them back together, but it's not worth the risk of trying it with 30 novice kids at once.</li>
				<li>If you want the computer to work after the activity, whoever is working on the electronics should be grounded before opening the case. If your classroom is humid and not carpeted, you can probably get away with skipping this step, but if your room is air conditioned or carpeted, so people pick up static charges, it's important. The pros do it with a metal strap wrapped around their wrist and clamped to a water pipe or electrical outlet box if one is mounted outside the wall. But touching the metal frame of anything in the room that has a three-prong power cord (and is plugged in) will do.<br />

		<h3>Lab Pages</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Page 1: Abstraction Inside the Computer.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This is a long lab with many pages; the point of this first page is to provide a table of contents, and a grouping of abstraction levels into three major &quot;domains&quot;: software, digital, and analog.</li>
								<li></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This tip is about the whole lab, not just the first page, but it's about the domains that are introduced here:
								  <ul>
								    <li>The levels of abstraction in the <em>software</em> domain are <em>different programs:</em> the application programs are written in a programming language, and use libraries, and interface with the operating system to control the hardware.</li>
								    <li>By contrast, the levels of abstraction in the <em>digital</em> domain are <em>different ways of thinking</em> about the <em>same</em> physical object. Envision yourself holding a processor chip in your hand, and asking yourself
								      <ul>
								        <li>What's it for?</li>
								        <li>What are the big pieces inside it?</li>
								        <li>What's physically	inside	the	plastic	case?</li>
								        <li>What are the primitive building blocks of a digital circuit?</li>
							          </ul>
								    </li>
							      </ul>
								</li>
								<li>Don't obsess, and don't let kids obsess, over the specific levels of abstraction. The main points are that software lets you control a computer, abstracting away the actual machine; and &quot;zeros and ones&quot; are an abstraction over the way transistors really work.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
                <li>
					<strong>Page 2: A Timeline of Computers.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Many young people think computers started in the 1980s with the Apple II and the IBM PC. (<em>Really</em> young people may think computers started with the iPhone.) The overarching point of this page is that people have been making machines to help them compute just about as long as there have been human beings. (But it <em>is</em> true that the timeline gets crowded starting in the 1960s.)</li>
								<li>We ask &quot;when was the first computer&quot; as a motivation for the page, and there <em>are</em> many possible answers, but one of them is the most important; don't leave this page before students understand what a stroke of genius Babbage's Analytical Engine was: the complete concept of programs and a programming language, with conditionals and loops, long before the low-level enabling technology (first relays in the 1930s, then vacuum tubes, then finally transistors) was available.
								  <ul>
								    <li>To make sure this point is clear: Long before Babbage there were machines that performed computations, but they had <em>one particular</em> computation built in, or at best (as in Babbage's Difference Engine) a particular family of computations, with a particular one selected by rearranging parts of the hardware. What was required for the modern idea of a computer was the idea of a computer <em>program,</em> as a kind of data, just like numbers, but with codes telling the machine what to do next. &quot;Program as data&quot; may seem like an esoteric idea when it's encountered in the form of higher order functions, but without that idea there couldn't be programmable computers at all.</li>
							      </ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>First just let students click around the timeline on whatever tickles their fancy.</li>
								<li>Then read with them the entries about Charles Babbage, Ida Lovelace, and Alan Turing. These are the patron saints of computer science. Babbage and Lovelace had little <em>practical</em> effect because it's just not possible to build a serious computer out of gears and cranks, but between them they had most of the crucial ideas of modern computing. Turing's work was of course tremendously practical. It's an exaggeration that he won World War II by himself; there were some soldiers involved, and a whole team of mathematicians (many of them women, as in the early days at NASA) working with him. And a team in Poland cracked a simpler version of the Enigma years earlier. But his work was crucial.</li>
								<li>Students met Turing in Unit 5, because of the halting theorem. You'll want to remind them of that, if they don't make the connection themselves.</li>
								<li>Much of this information comes from Wikipedia, and we debated providing links to the articles in the timeline. But Wikipedia is hard reading, and may give more detail than students will want. Consider suggesting to the most interested students that they follow up on a topic by searching Wikipedia for it.</li>
								<li>There are opportunities here for students to pursue a topic in as much depth as they choose. Just for example, a student might want to learn to do arithmetic on an abacus. It's fun, but it does require a certain amount of memorization. (It's also possible that some of your students already know how. If a student volunteers to demonstrate, by all means make time for that. But beware of requiring Asian students to represent their culture of origin; some will be trying hard to be as American as possible.)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
                <li>
					<strong>Page 3: The Software Domain: Applications.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This page is very light on technical content. For the most part it's telling students things they already know from real life, although we try to emphasize <em>creating</em> media, for example, rather than just consuming media.</li>
								<li>The real point here is implicit: People mostly think of apps as the complete story about software, but actually apps are the tip of the iceberg, supported by a huge collection of other software.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Here and there in the litany of software uses are bad ones: fake news, finding out your political views. Don't over-emphasize these, but also don't leave the page until at least one comes up in discussion.</li>
