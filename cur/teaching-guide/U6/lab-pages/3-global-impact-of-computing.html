							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Gain insight on how technology is impacting human communication and collaboration in a vast range of fields from commerce to entertainment to health care.</li>
								<li>Learn about the ways in which citizenship and citizen participation are being redefined in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</li>
                                <li>Catch a glimpse as to how progress in machine learning and data-mining is expanding the horizons of human innovation.</li>
                                <li>Consider the economic, social and cultural implications of technology. </li>
                                <li>Become aware of the issues around intellectual property in the modern era.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>You can have the students watch these videos together as a class or assign as homework.</li>
								<li>The AP CSP exam has many questions about the global impact of computing so be sure that students take this lab seriously despite its more relaxed format.</li>
                                <li>Be sure to have some discussion on the issues raised by the videos.</li>
                                <li>If the pace of these videos is ever too fast for your students or yourself, you can use the "speed" feature of YouTube (at the settings menu) to adjust the pace. (75% seems to be just about right.)</li>
