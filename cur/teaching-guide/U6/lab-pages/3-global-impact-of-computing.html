		<h2>Lab 3: Global Impact of Computing</h2>
		<p>This lab is intended to give your class a break from the regular work routine while getting a glimpse at how computing is impacting the world.  Dan Garcia, the BJC edX instructor from UC Berkeley, talks about many fascinating issues, providing interesting examples and anecdotes.</p> 
		

		<h3>Pacing</h3>
		<div>
			The 1 lab page could be split across 2 or 3 days (60-90 minutes). Expected times to complete follow:
		  <ul>
				<li>60-90 minutes (2-3 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/3-global-impact/1-global-impact.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F6-how-computers-work.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Global Impact of Computing</a></li>
			</ul>

							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Gain insight on how technology is impacting human communication and collaboration in a vast range of fields from commerce to entertainment to health care.</li>
								<li>Learn about the ways in which citizenship and citizen participation is being redefined in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</li>
                                <li>Catch a glimpse as to how progress in machine learning and data-mining is expanding the horizons of human innovation.</li>
                                <li>Consider the economic, social and cultural implications of technology. </li>
                                <li>Become aware of the issues around intellectual property in the modern era.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>You can have the students watch these videos together as a class or assign as homework.</li>
								<li>The AP CSP examp has many questions about the global impact of computing so be sure that students take this lab seriously despite its more relaxed format.</li>
                                <li>Be sure to have some discussion on the issues raised by the videos.</li>
                                <li>Dan Garcia is fabulous lecturer, beloved in the UC Berkeley community and it is hoped that you will greatly enjoy these videos.  He is also known for speaking too fast at times.  If the pace is ever too much for your students or yourself, you can use the "speed" feature of YouTube (at the settings menu) to adjust the pace. (75% seems to be just about perfect.)</li>
