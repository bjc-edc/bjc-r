            <strong>If There Is Time:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Exercise 1: 
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>They are 2017 – 1975 = 42 years apart.</li>
                        <li>In 42 years there are 21 two-years.  So the factor will be 2<sup>21</sup>.</li>
                        <li>Recall from  <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/5-representation-compression/2-sequences.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F6-how-computers-work.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Binary Sequences">Unit 4 Lab 5: Binary Sequences page</a> that 1MB = 2<sup>20</sup> bytes and 1TB = 2<sup>40</sup> bytes. In 42 years, with Moore's Law, we would expect 1MB to become 2<sup>21</sup>MB = (2<sup>21</sup>)(2<sup>20</sup>) = 2<sup>41</sup> bytes.  As 2<sup>41</sup> = 2 &times; 2<sup>40</sup> this equals 2TB.  The actual value of 3TB is 1.5 times the predicted value of 2TB but it is a remarkably close prediction given the span of time.</li>

            </ul>
            <strong>Take It Further:</strong>
            <ul>
            	<li>Exercise A:  Heat sinks are irregularly shaped because heat dissipation is a function of surface area, and irregular shapes can fit more surface area into the same volume, taking up less space in the computer case.</li>
            </ul>
