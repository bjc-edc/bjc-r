		<h2>Lab 1: Number Representation</h2>
        <!--<div class="sidenoteBig">
        	<p>In the 2017-2018 version of BJC, this lab will likely be moved to a new unit focused on how computers work (covering AP CSP Learning Objectives 1.3.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.2.3, 3.3.1, 4.1.2, 5.2.1, 5.5.1, 7.2.1).</p>
            <p>This lab has been included here in the 2016-2017 update to Unit 4 in order to maintain consistency of standards coverage with the rest of the 2016-2017 version of the curriculum.</p>
        </div>-->
        <p>This lab addreses the requirements of AP CSP Enduring Understanding 2.1.2, "Explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data." (It does not cover <em>hardware</em> abstraction levels.) The first page introduces binary representation as a place value system just like decimal representation, but with only two digits (0 and 1) instead of ten (0 through 9). The second page explains how a sequence of bits can represent information other than integers, and in particular explains floating point as an approximation for real numbers. The third page introduces hexadecimal representation, which uses sixteen digits (0-9 and A-F), building on students' understanding of binary. On the fourth page, students learn to translate between hex and binary and about the use of hex in RGB colors. The last page is an optional project in which students build a decimal-to-binary conversion procedure based on and reviewing their work with base 2 representation.</p>

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
        	The 4 required lab pages could be split across 3-6 days (<strong>120-240 minutes</strong>). Expected times to complete follow:
			<ul>
                <li>
                	30-60 minutes (1-2 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/1-number-representation/1-binary.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F6-how-computers-work.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Binary Representation</a>
                </li>
				<li>35-70 minutes (1-2 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/1-number-representation/2-binary-sequences.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F6-how-computers-work.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Binary Sequences</a></li>

		<h3>Prepare:</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>There's no such thing as a "binary <em>number</em>" or a "hexadecimal <em>number</em>." </strong> The way we represent a number—as XXXI<sub>Roman</sub> or 31<sub>10</sub> or 11111<sub>2</sub> or 1F<sub>16</sub> or "thirty-one" or "treinta y uno"—is language or notation. The <em>number</em>, itself, is the same, regardless of what language we express it in. It helps the distinction to say "binary <em>numerals</em>" or "binary <em>representation</em>" instead of "binary numbers." Some curriculum materials are less careful. It's not just pedantry; students  understand the conversions better when they remain clearly aware that only the notation, not the <em>number,</em> changes. Explicitly making the analogy with Roman numerals may help; students are likely to understand and be able to extend from the idea XXXI and 31 are the same number written different ways.</li>
				<li>&quot;Hexadecimal&quot; is often abbreviated just to &quot;hex.&quot; Either is fine to use generally, but students should recognize both.</li>

                    Students do not need to become proficient at converting among representations—not for the AP, not for careers in programming, not for anything—but some students find these notational changes interesting and may <em>like</em>  to play one or more of the following number representation games <em>on their own time</em>. The games (or any other focus on skill at conversion) should not become a distraction  from the essential content of the unit.

                        <!--<li>We want to make range limitations in computer arithmetic something that students can explore experimentally, so we start by having them write a factorial procedure, because that's a function that grows very quickly, so even for small inputs they can see the results of range limitations.</li>
                        <li>But we also want to emphasize that allowing human beings to see hardware limitations is a gross failure of abstraction, and that a good programming language doesn't allow that to happen. As the page explains, <em>people have died</em> because of integer overflow. Thus, for pedagogic purposes, Snap<em>!</em> can simulate both bad and good languages.</li>-->
                        <!--<li>Snap<em>!</em> can simulate both bignum and non-bignum languages. You can use that to show that it is a failure of abstraction for computer languages to force users to think about and work around hardware limitations.</li>-->

                        <li>Don't overemphasize number representations.  This is a popular topic because it's easy, but it doesn't call for deep understanding; hex is just a notation that people find convenient in a few computing contexts (<em>very</em> few, actually; RGB and IPv6 pretty much exhaust them).</li>
                        <li>Although base 16 is a base in its own right, it's <em>important</em> only as an abbreviation for the underlying binary. You don't necessarily have to say that to students, but don't allow a mystique to develop around hex.</li>
