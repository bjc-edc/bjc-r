                            Exercise 2:  This will depend on the computer that you use.  In a 64-bit computer, 22 is the first integer whose factorial does not fit in a word and rounding starts:<br />

To find out the number of digits, just ask Snap<em>!</em>: <img width="244" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/digits-in-factorial-200.png" alt="length of ((200) !) reporting 375" title="length of ((200) !) reporting 375"></li>

                           Take It Further: <br />
&quot;One significant digit&quot; means that, for example, 200 is representable, but 210 isn't. Here are <em>all</em> the representable values:
<ul>
  <li>0</li>
  <li>0.01, 0.02, ... 0.09</li>
  <li>0.1, 0.2, ... 0.9</li>
  <li>1, 2, ... 9</li>
  <li>10, 20, ... 90</li>
  <li>100, 200, ... 900</li>
</ul>
So there are
                        exactly 46 representable values. Here they are, on the number line:<br />
     <img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/floats.png" width="1200" alt="number line with floating point values plotted"> <br />
     It's easy to see the multiples of 10 and of 100, but all the smaller values are a blur.  If you could zoom in on the range from 0 to 10, it would look the same, with the multiples of 0.1 and 1 visible, and the multiples of 0.01 just a blur.
     <p>What are the pros and cons of this representation?  Only 28 integer values can be represented, so 972 integers less than 1000 <em>can't</em> be.  This seems like a severe weakness, but remember, the rules of this game say that you only have enough room in your representation for 46 values altogether. You could choose multiples of 20, to get all your values evenly spaced, but then you get no fractions at all.  This system gives you a few really small values, a few medium-sized values, and a few really big values.  So physicists can measure the size of an electron, astronomers can measure the size of the galaxy, and the rest of us can budget our money.</p>
     <p>By the way, if you want to make this picture in Snap<em>!</em>, you need a widescreen monitor, and then you can click on the gear (settings) menu, choose &quot;stage size,&quot; and set the horizontal size to 1200 so there's some margin around your number line.</p></li>

                        <li>Exercise 7: Human beings use decimal because we have ten fingers, and computers use decimal when they are interacting with human beings. When they're <em>not</em> interacting with people, computers use binary because transistors have two stable states. Neither people nor computers really speak hex, but when people are forced to deal with binary, we use hex as an abbreviation (one fourth the length of the binary numeral), and so computers use hex to convey binary to humans. RGB color codes are just one instance of that.</li>
                        <li>Exercise 8: In all of these contexts, abstraction is used to hide complexity and to simplify things.  Hexadecimal representation abbreviates binary representation and makes it more readable, just as custom blocks and ADT's simplify complex code and make the code more readable.</li>

                <ul>
                <li>Exercise 1: If you look at the given table you will see 3 entries under "how many" and 3 corresponding entries for "what color".  So the 6 values would be:<br /> {60, (transparent), 5, (231,167,32), 93, (transparent)}. </li>
                <li>Exercise 2: RGB:(231,167,32) in hexadecimal is: E7A720  and you get this <span style="color:#E7A720">orangeish brown color</span> which is a slight variation of the color called <span style="color:#DAA520">"Goldenrod"</span>. (It's actually exactly the color of the Control blocks in Snap<em>!</em>.)</li>
                <li>Exercise 3: The one on the right is the compressed picture. If you look closely you will notice that the picture on the right is slightly more blurry than the one on the left.  A few colors are also a little off, especially the very bright reflections from some of the rocks. What is surprising is how similar they look despite the effects of lossy compression.</li>
