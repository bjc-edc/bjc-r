		<h2>Lab 2: History and Impact of Computers</h2>
		<p>At the start of this lab, students explore  some highlights in the long history of computing from ancient times to today.  Then, Moore's law is introduced in the context of recent exponentially-paced progress in the field of computers.   The last page of the lab is intended to give your class a break from the regular work routine while providing a glimpse at how computing is impacting the world.  Dan Garcia, the BJC edX instructor from UC Berkeley, talks about many  issues relevant to the AP Computer Science Principles exam and provides interesting examples and anecdotes.</p>

					<strong>Page 1: A Timeline of Computers.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
                        	<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Appreciate that people have been making machines to help them compute just about as long as there have been human beings.</li>
                            	<li>Learn about the critical moments the history of computing and the fundamental innovations that made the recent rapid progress in the field of computing possible.</li>                                
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>First, just let students click around the timeline on whatever catches their interest. We ask "when was the first computer" to motivate this. </li>
								<div class="comment">FOR NEXT YEAR, Instead of exaggerating, can we just say the truth "Alan Turing's team helps to win WWII"? --MF, 12/15/17</div>
                                <li>Then read and/or discuss together these four entries: "Difference Engine," "Analytical Engine," "First Programmer," and "Alan Turing wins World War II." Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and Alan Turing are the grandparents of computer science. Babbage and Lovelace had little <em>practical</em> effect because it's just not possible to build a serious computer out of gears and cranks, but between them, they had most of the crucial ideas of modern computing. Turing's work <em>was</em> practical. It's an exaggeration to say that <em>he</em> won World War II; there were millions of soldiers involved, and a whole team of mathematicians working with him. And a team in Poland cracked a simpler version of the Enigma years earlier. But Turing's work was crucial.</li>
								<li>Students first learned about Turing when they explored the halting theorem on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/4-unsolvable-undecidable/2-halting-problem.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="An Undecidable Problem">Unit 5 Lab 4: An Undecidable Problem</a>. If they don't make the connection themselves, be sure to remind them.</li>
                                <li>There are many opportunities here for students to pursue a topic in as much depth as they choose.</li>
                                <div class="sidenote">If your connection blocks YouTube, watch the videos here: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/youtube/57wj8diYpgY" target="_blank" title="video on Ivan Sutherland's work on Sketchpad">video on Ivan Sutherland's work on Sketchpad</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/youtube/hRYnloqYKGY" target="_blank" title="video from Douglas Engelbart's 'Mother of All Demos'">video from Douglas Engelbart's "Mother of All Demos"</a></div>
                                <li>Your students may enjoy watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/57wj8diYpgY?rel=0" target="_blank" title="video on Ivan Sutherland's work on Sketchpad">video on Ivan Sutherland's work on Sketchpad</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hRYnloqYKGY?rel=0" target="_blank" title="video from Douglas Engelbart's 'Mother of All Demos'">video from Douglas Engelbart's "Mother of All Demos"</a>. These videos help students appreciate the early forms of the technology we use every day. The first video, in particular, is rather slow, and students may find it easier to engage with the ideas if you play it at a faster speed through the Settings menu accessible in the lower-right of the video. </li>

					<strong>Page 2: Moore's Law.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
                            <strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Understand Moore's Law, that transistor count in ICs has approximately doubled every year or two.</li>
                                <li>Understand that computer processor speed and memory size have roughly followed the same growth.</li>
                                <li>Appreciate that Moore's Law isn't a law of nature and has limitations.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Make sure students understand that Moore's Law is only a <em>predictor</em> for a general trend; the law does not guarantee specific dates for technological progress.</li>
								<li>If students find the graph difficult to interpret, take time to introduce the concept of exponential growth and consider providing some numerical examples of doubling.</li>

					<strong>Page 3: Global Impact of Computing.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
                            	<li>Consider how technology is affecting human communication, thinking, and innovation across a range of fields in both positive and negative ways.</li>
                                <li>Consider the economic, social, and cultural implications of technology and how technology is shaped by these aspects of society. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>You can have the students watch these videos in class or assign as homework, but be mindful of student access to computers and the Internet outside of class.</li>
								<li>The AP CSP exam has many questions about the global impact of computing so be sure that students take this lab seriously despite its more relaxed format.</li>
                                <li>If the pace of these videos is too fast or too slow for your students, show them how to use the "speed" feature of YouTube (in the Settings menu in the lower right of each video) to adjust the pace.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
                        <li>
							<strong>Discussion:</strong> The student page asks student pairs to discuss and summarize several ideas from the videos. Engage in some whole class discussion as well.
