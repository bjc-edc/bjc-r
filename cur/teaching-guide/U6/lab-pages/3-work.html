        <p>Intro paragraph here.</p> 

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
			There are five pages in this lab. The 5 lab pages could be split across X or X days (X-X minutes). Expected times to complete follow:
			<ul>
				<li>X-X minutes on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-recursion/3-work/1-past-and-future.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Past and Future</a></li>
				<li>X-X minutes on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-recursion/3-work/2-working-conditions.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Working Conditions</a></li>
				<li>X-X minutes on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-recursion/3-work/3-working-remotely.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Working Remotely</a></li>

        <h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>In <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-recursion/3-work/4-computer-simulations.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Computer Simulations</a>, students will spend some time examining the impact of computing on different fields (such as biology, music, etc.). Students might find <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/openers.html#computingnews" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> stories that explore connections between computing and other fields.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h3>Students will:</h3>
        <!-- <div class="sidenoteBig">
        	<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
        	<ul>
            	<li></li>
            </ul>
        </div> -->
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning goals here.</li>

        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div class="classIndent">
        <h4>Past and Future</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Students think about how jobs have changed and continue to change.</li>
                <li>Resources: 
                	<ul>
                    	<li><a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/home.htm" target="_blank">Occupational Outlook Handbook (Bureau of Labor Statistics)</a>. Under "select occupations by", choose "growth rate (projected)" to see what jobs are declining and growing.</li>
                        <li><a href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/Choosing/future-jobs.htm" target="_blank">Future Jobs (University of Kent)</a></li>
                        <li><a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-will-ai-impact-jobs-high-powered-panel-tackles-the-big-question/" target="_blank">"How will AI impact jobs?" (TechRepublic)</a>. Interesting quote at the end: "Maybe we need to let go of the obsession that we all need jobs."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Once students have brainstormed responses, have a discussion:
                	<ul>
                    	<li>What do you study/do to prepare for a job that doesn't exist yet?</li>
                        <li>What are some jobs that you think cannot (and will not ever) be automated?</li>
                        <li>How do your own career interests and plans line up with our discussion today? (Note the goal is not to incite fear or anxiety, but to perhaps think differently about work.)</li>
                        <li>As you think about the jobs of the future, how do they compare to the jobs of the past and present? Better or worse? More or less interesting? More or less satisfying? More or less meaningful?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Working Conditions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Examples of ways that technology has affected working conditions:
                	<ul>
                    	<li>The canonical example is people who take phone calls from customers at big companies (including Directory Assistance operators at the phone company). Their workstations collect information about how long it takes each worker to handle a call, on average, and also on how well the customer rates the worker. Managers see all this information in real time and can yell at slow or surly workers.</li>
        	    		<li>Some employers put key-card locks on the rest rooms, so their computers can collect information on who takes a lot of bathroom breaks.</li>
        	    		<li>Uber competes with licensed taxis, without having to follow the licensing rules; some cities have banned them for this reason. Uber drivers are considered independent contractors, so Uber doesn't have to provide health insurance or unemployment compensation, and yet arguably Uber determines their conditions of work, so they <em>should</em> be employees. (All this has to be explained in a way understandable to students of course.)</li>
        	    		<li>It <em>is</em> possible to use computers in ways that improve the conditions of work. Scandinavian countries, in which, by law, unions must be represented on corporate boards of directors, have experimented along these lines. The idea is to set up computer systems that give the worker the right information at the right time, without telling the worker what to do.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Working Remotely</h4>
            <ul>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Computer Simulations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Expanding Possibilities</h4>

                <li></li>
