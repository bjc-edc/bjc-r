        <h2>Lab 5: Robots and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are both very active fields of research and development. Students are introduced to some ideas in artificial intelligence, but the bulk of the Lab is focused on researching new developments in a wide range of areas. Students will not only hear about new breakthroughs, but will also discuss remaining challenges and consequences, both positive and negative, of the new technology.</p>


		<h3>Pacing:</h3>

        <h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>The news is full of stories about artificial intelligence. Continue to use <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/openers.html#computingnews" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a>, and know that students will also be reading and sharing many articles during this Lab.</li>
                <li>
                    There are many online resources about AI that you can use to become more familiar with the subject. Some potentially useful resources that are not included in the students materials are:
                    <ul>

        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 1: What is AI?</strong>
					<ul>
                        <li>This discussion focuses on one aspect of AI - getting computers to recognize and understand images. This topic is an example of human intelligence that we might not always think of as &quot;intelligence&quot; but which is very difficult for computers.</li>
                        <li>
                            During the class discussion, ask students to identify social implications of this technology. For example, the articles listed on the student page might lead to discussions of:
                            <ul>
                                <li>An app that names objects helps the visually impaired. This technology can also translate to <a href="http://www.popsci.com/fda-allows-marketing-device-lets-blind-see-their-tongues" target="_blank">new medical devices</a></li>
                                <li>Facial recognition tags photos in Facebook, can be used instead of passwords, and is <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/21/us-airports-roll-out-facial-recognition-software/" target="_blank">used at airports</a> - what are the privacy implications of widespread facial recognition technology? For example, facial recognition software might result in an increase of those seeking plastic surgery - though <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328476-300-software-could-spot-face-changing-criminals/" target="_blank">computer scientists have already thought of this</a>.</li>
                                <li>What are the consequences of identifying images incorrectly? This could lead to the wrong person being arrested for a crime, accidents caused by self-driving cars, drones targeting innocent people, incorrect medical diagnoses, and so on. This is not just a matter of improving technology; we also know that images can be manipulated, and computers can be &quot;fooled&quot; into mis-identifying images.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The optional Take It Further prompts encourage students to explore some key AI ideas. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 2: Recent Breakthroughs.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students choose a topic, then find articles that relate AI to the topic. Try to encourage students to find examples that aren't just about robots, since the next page in the Lab focuses on robots.</li>
                        <li>
                            Depending on how much class time you want to devote, you might have students:
                            <ul>
                                <li>share a 30-second summary of one of their findings.</li>
                                <li>contribute to a shared class document of links to interesting articles.</li>
                                <li>make a slide presentation of the articles they found. They can have one slide per article, then a concluding slide about challenges that remain or positive and negative consequences.</li>
                                <li>get in small groups and share their findings and discuss challenges and positive and negative consequences.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 3: Robots and Humans.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You can choose whether or not you want the first activity to have a competitive element. The goal is to get students to see that most robots are designed to do one thing, and that a lot goes into getting robots to perform relatively simple tasks.
                            <ul>
                                <li>As a way of collecting this information, you might have a shared spreadsheet where students can contribute the name of the activity and a link to the video (or image).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Prompts 2-4 are each about a different field and its connection to robotics. Depending on your class, you may:
                            <ul>
                                <li>choose just one of the topics, have everyone find interesting articles, and come together for a class discussion.</li>
                                <li>have individuals or pairs choose a prompt, find articles, then share a short summary of what they found.</li>
                                <li>put students in 3 small groups, one per topic, and have the students work on researching the topic and presenting it to the class.</li>
                                <li>give students the chance to look briefly through these examples, then ask them to choose one of these topics or choose their own topic and come up with a list of interesting articles, which can be collected on a shared document.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 4: Implications of AI.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The three prompts are unrelated, and could each lead to substantial discussion. Pick and choose the topics you think the class would enjoy discussing.</li>
                        <li>
                            The first prompt asks students to consider humanoid robots. Students can discuss:
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Should</em> people be trying to build robots that look like humans?</li>
                                <li>What about prosthetic devices? Does it make sense to build prosthetic devices that are human-like? Then imagine a future where more and more of the body can be replaced by prosthetic parts. This might make us think - what makes us &quot;human&quot;?</li>
                                <li>This is not just a question for the future. For example, consider how we name digital assistants: <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/why-do-so-many-digital-assistants-have-feminine-names/475884/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20AtlanticScienceAndTechnology%20%28The%20Atlantic%20-%20Technology%29" target="_blank">Why Do So Many Digital Assistants Have Feminine Names?</a> What do our choices about names and images say about our values and how they get translated into technology?</li>
                                <li>There are many tasks at which robots are better than humans. What does it mean not only to have humanoid robots, but humanoid robots that are superior to humans in some ways?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The second prompt is actually a series of questions about the ethics of AI. There are several options for how to structure discussions:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                	Choose one question and discuss as a class.
									<ul>
										<li>Don't let students get trapped in either/or dilemmas if there are alternatives not under discussion. For example, in the question about preferring the life of the passenger or the life of a pedestrian, a better answer than either of those is &quot;the car must not get into such situations; it has already failed in its ethical duty if the question arises, so it's not surprising that there's no good answer.&quot; The same is true for human drivers, isn't it? That's why they teach defensive driving.</li>
                                	</ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Choose one question, identify different positions or stakeholders, and stage a debate in the class.</li>
                                <li>Have students write an opinion piece based on one of these questions.</li>
                                <li>Have students write a fictional piece about a moral/ethical dilemma of AI or robotics.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The third prompt is intended to end the discussion of AI and robotics on a positive note. It is also meant to encourage students to see themselves in roles that help shape the future in these fields. Students may:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Write a short essay answering this prompt.</li>
                                <li>Deliver a short (3-minute) speech to answer the prompt, either live to the class or as a video.</li>
                                <li>Have a whole-class discussion in which students first call out technologies that interest them, and then go through the list together, identifying benefits and ways to minimize risks.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
