		<h2>Lab 1: Recursive Reporters</h2>
        <p>This lab extends the learning students have done about recursive commands to <strong>recursive reporters</strong>, functions that use recursions for organization and bookkeeping. Students create and experiment with simple recursive reporters, and learn how recursive reporters differ in structure from recursive commands.</p>

                                    What issues do you have to think about when building a recursive reporter?

                            <strong>Tips:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>As students complete the table, see if they are using Snap<em>!</em> to do the work or are counting by hand. If counting by hand, students may miss some of the branches, and may miss the overall concept of finding a pattern from one level to the next. Remind them about the recursion in how <code>tree</code> is built.</li>
                                <li>Students may need a refresher on the phrase "power of two".</li>
                                <li>Even though there is a note on this page about it, students often forget they must hit "Apply" before they can use a block recursively.</li>
                                <li>For students having trouble writing the recursion, ask them what they would write in language. This may help them build a useful description.</li>
                                <li>It's okay to move on if not all students have successfully built the recursive reporter. Some correct code appears later on the page, and another opportunity is given to solve a similar problem.</li>
                                <li>The work on the <code>triangles in fractal</code> block should go very similarly to the work earlier on this page. Students may need a moment to figure out the relationship, either through a look back at the code from Unit 6, or by making a table.</li>
                                <li>One potential mistake here is for students to count only the smallest triangles. Resolve this by having students build a level 2 triangle fractal, then asking them to count the triangles. They should say there are 4 triangles, not 3, and this will help them discover the relationship.</li>
                            </ul>

							<strong>Discussion:</strong> How do I use operations and combiners in recursive reporters?

								<li>What math combiners could be used in a recursive reporter, and how do they work?</li>

                            <strong>Tips:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The initial exercise on factorial should be a good check of students' progress on the previous pages, especially their understanding of how to build a recursive call.</li>
                                <li>Students may have more difficulty using list and string combiners than math combiners in recursion. When possible, show how the list and string combiners behave like math combiners (producing a single answer from two partial answers).</li>
                                <li>The <code>letter count</code> activity can be solved without recursion. If students do this, good! Show their solution along with the recursive solution. You should let these students know that learning recursion is still important, and that many problems are more easily solved with recursion.</li>
                                <li>If students are having trouble with building the recursive call in letter count, have them write a sentence, then cover up the first word. Then cover the first and second words. This could help them see the potential for a recursive solution.</li>
                                <li>If time is tight, skip the <code>my join words</code> task.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
