        <h2>Social Implications Lab 5: Explosion of Bits; Games and Violence</h2>
 
        <p>Students begin to see that there are many social implications to computing. The <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading highlights ways the world has been changed by computing and identifies examples that might not look at first like a "bits story" but is. In this lab, students get a range of experiences, including reading the book, beginning to compile a list of computing innovations, debating the hot topic of whether violent video games cause youth violence, and finding evidence for ways that technology can be both good and bad.</p> 
        <p>Activities related to finding and describing computing innovations helps prepare students for the Explore Performance Task. The writing and video exercises (such as making a video about an innovation, supporting a claim about privacy using evidence, supporting a claim about video games using evidence, and brainstorming evidence for claims about whether technology is good or bad) also prepare students for the Explore Task. Important AP topics that are addressed in this Lab include a preliminary exploration of bits and looking into a broad range of computing innovations.</p>
        
        <h3>A note about Social Implications Labs:</h3>
        <p>There is a lot of material presented on the student pages, including multiple options for discussing or otherwise exploring certain topics. It is not expected that every idea gets used. The descriptions under "As a Class" below indicate certain activities are optional or okay to skip.</p>
        

        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>The 4 lab pages span the week. If you haven't already, consider Expected times:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>30-40 minutes on What are some social implications of computing?
            <ul>
            	<li>This could take longer if students spend time in class to make and show their videos.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>40-50 minutes on Tanya Rider's Story, including an unplugged activity about binary numbers</li>
            <li>60-75 minutes on Do violent video games contribute to youth violence?</li>
            <li>40-50 minutes on Is technology good or bad?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
        
        <div class="sidenote">Options for students to access <em>Blown to Bits</em> include reading it as an <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter1.pdf" target="_blank">online PDF</a>, purchasing hard copies of the book, or photocopying pages so students can make annotations as they read.</div>
        
            <ul>
                <li>If you haven't yet, make sure you use <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> as an opener this week.</li>
                <li>Consider using unused openers from <a href="//bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/Week01/activities.html" target="_blank">Week 1</a> and <a href="//bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/Week02/activities.html" target="_blank">Week 2</a>. Students may find that some of these ideas are clearer after stepping away from the computer and giving the ideas time to sink in.</li>
                <li>Think about how you want students to interact with computers and each other this week. Students will need to be on the computer at times to do some online research. You may choose to print out <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">Chapter 1 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a> so that students can annotate as they read. Students will also engage in discussion with each other, so think of a way to arrange your space so students can have eye contact with each other.</li>
                <li>Review all lab activities, especially the <a href="http://csunplugged.org/binary-numbers/" target="_blank">binary numbers activity</a> that goes with Tanya Rider's story and the debate activities included with Do violent video games contribute to youth violence? (<a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Skill-5-Counterargument-DRMO-One-Pager.docx" target="_blank">making counterarguments</a>) and Is technology good or bad? (<a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Brainstorm-Game-Narrative.pdf" target="_blank">brainstorm game</a>).</li>

        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <h4>What <em>are</em> some social implications of computing?</h4>
        <ul>
        	<div class="sidenote"> Creativity is one of the Big Ideas of the course</div>
            <li>If students already did the first writing assignment (<strong>How do you interact with computers and digital media?</strong> from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/Week01/assignments.html" target="_blank">Week 1 Assignments</a>) share some of their responses, for example by displaying them anonymously on a document camera. Highlight any responses that describe ways that students use computers and media to be creative.</li>
            <li>Have students brainstorm computing innovations. For a fast-paced activity, pass out several whiteboard markers at a time and have students put ideas on the board and pass the markers to each other. There are several ways to then interact with this list:
            <ul>
            	<li>Take a picture of the board or otherwise record the responses (such as in a classwide Google doc). Throughout the year, build on this list as a resource for students for when they choose an innovation to write about for the AP Explore Performance Task.</li>
                <div class="sidenote">Think of what and how you will collect work from your students.</div>
                <li>Ask students (individually or in groups) to choose two innovations to research online. Have them write about the innovations with the prompt on the student page, citing their sources.</li>
                <li>Optional: Have small groups of students make a short video about a computing innovation. The technology you use will depend on what is available to you. Students might capture videos on their phones (this can be assigned for homework if they are not allowed to use phones in the school) or use software like iMovie or <a href="http://screencast-o-matic.com" target="_blank">Screencast-o-matic</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h4>What does Tanya Rider's story have to do with the explosion of bits?</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>Much of <em>Blown to Bits</em> has to do with the balance between the abundance of digital information and our attempts for retaining privacy and ownership of our own information. Have students read the selection with the guiding questions in mind, then discuss briefly. Students may also be interested in looking up news stories or videos about Tanya Rider.</li>
            <li>The text briefly mentions that bits are "zeroes and ones." To give students a sense for how zeroes and ones can encode information, consider using <a href="http://csunplugged.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/unplugged-01-binary_numbers.pdf" target="_blank">the first activity (Binary Numbers) on pages 5-6</a> from csunplugged.org (here's the <a href="http://csunplugged.org/binary-numbers/" target="_blank">main page for the activity</a>). Note that students will learn about binary in more detail later in the year - the objective here is to see that a sequence of 0 and 1 can encode information.</li>
            <li>Optional: Have students write down three arguments for the positions given about privacy. Privacy as a social implications topic will be discussed in depth in Unit 2 and is a recurring theme, so skip this activity if you don't have time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Do violent video games contribute to youth violence?</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>Let students know that they will have the opportunity to examine evidence from both sides of the debate. To open the activity, consider having students place themselves along a continuum in the room. Call one side of your classroom "strongly agree" and the other side "strongly disagree" and have students stand in a line according to their current view on whether violent video games contribute to youth violence.
            <ul>
            	<li>Students are expressing their opinion and there may be disagreements. Tell students that they will get a chance to examine these views more in depth today and that it is quite possible for opinions to change based on learning more evidence. Also, there are many reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with this statement, and that the classroom will be a place to consider evidence from both sides thoughtfully.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <div class="sidenote">The emphasis of this activity is to identify <em>evidence</em> to back up a claim.</div>
            <li>Depending on your students, you might randomly assign students to either pro or con (e.g., by flipping a coin), have them skim through the evidence and decide for themselves, or assign them the opposite view from what they expressed when they stood on the continuum. Give students 15-20 minutes to read through the information presented on the websites (and do their own research, if they wish) about their side and identify three pieces of evidence they find most convincing.</li>
            <li>As time permits, do the other activities on the student page (explain data, make a video, make a video of a counterargument). If you don't have time to make videos, you might still do an activity around counterarguments. For example, use the <a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Activity-10-Skill-4-Counterargument-Class-Challenge.docx" target="_blank">Counterargument Class Challenge template</a> from the Boston Debate League.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Is technology good or bad?</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>If you wish to skip a section of Chapter 1 of <em>Blown to Bits</em>, then skip the first activity on the student page about the Koans of Bits. If you do this section, have students in small groups read about just <em>one</em> of the Koans and prepare to teach the rest of the class about what they read.</li>
            <li>The <a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Brainstorm-Game-Narrative.pdf" target="_blank">Brainstorm Game</a> is another teaching resource from the Boston Debate League. You can choose to play this as a game or simply present this as a writing/discussion activity. This activity can also follow the <a href"/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/Week03/activities.html" target="_blank"> Snap Judgment opener</a> <strong>Is technology good or bad?</strong>.</li>
            <li>Have students read the last section of Chapter 1 of <em>Blown to Bits</em>. Have a class discussion about how technology can be both good and bad. Students can also revisit the computing innovation they examined a few days ago to describe in more detail how there are ways that the technology can help and hurt.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <div>
        <ul>
        	<li>Talk to English Language Arts teachers at your school to learn the strategies your students know for annotating texts. Encourage use of these close reading strategies.</li>
