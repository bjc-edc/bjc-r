		<p><ul><li>There are many options for students to access <em>Blown to Bits</em>. They can read it as an <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter1.pdf">online PDF</a> or you may choose to purchase hard copies of the book. You may also photocopy the book for students so that they can make annotations as they read.</li></ul></p>

        	<ul>
            	<li><strong>Is technology good or bad?</strong> <a>Google doc</a><br>
                Technology is not all good or all bad. In this Snap Judgment assignment, look for ways that students use evidence to support claims they make about positive advancements or negative implications of technology. This is not meant to be a polished piece of writing, but should result in students thinking of examples to support their position. In class, they will read pages 13-17 of Blown to Bits which addresses both sides. [Also include link to BDL]</li>
                <li><strong>Should violent video games be sold to minors?</strong> <a>Google doc</a><br>
                This question is the subject of an article that students will read today in class. Students again must construct an argument to support a position. Emphasize the importance of providing reasons and considering counterarguments that might be made by the other side.</li>
                
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Read <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter1.pdf"><em>Blown to Bits</em></a> pages 1-4<br>
        <strong>Guiding Question</strong>: What does Tanya Rider's story have to do with the explosion of bits?</p>
        <p>Much of <em>Blown to Bits</em> has to do with the balance between the abundance of digital information and our attempts for retaining privacy and ownership of our own information. Have students read the selection with the guiding question in mind, then discuss briefly. Students may also be interested in looking up news stories or videos about Tanya Rider. Examples:
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/10247516.html">Sheriff apologizes to husband of trapped woman (Komo News)</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/09/experience-trapped-in-ravine">Experience: I was trapped in a ravine for eight days (The Guardian)</a></li></ul> </p>
            
            	
		<h3>Research</h3>
        <div class="sidenote"><strong>Looking ahead</strong><br>Next week students will form groups of 2-3, choose a computing innovation that interests them, and produce a short video that explains the innovation and some of its impacts. Eventually, students will use this experience to help them with their AP CS Principles Explore Task, about implications of computing innovations.</div>
        <p>Look through these lists of recent innovations:
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/a-world-transformed-what-are-the-top-30-innovations-of-the-last-30-years/">Wharton's top 30 innovations</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/12/tech/cnn10-ideas/?hpt=hp_t1">CNN's 10 ideas</a></li>
        </ul>
        Not all of these are computing innovations, but many are related to computing.</p>
        <p><strong>Guiding Question</strong>: Which of these innovations are you familiar with? Look up a few innovations that you are unfamiliar with to see what they do, what they are used for, and what kind of impact they have on the way we live.</p>
        <p>Note: You might encourage students to start their own Google doc to keep track of their findings. As they look up information online, encourage them to be in the habit of keeping track of and citing their sources.</p>
