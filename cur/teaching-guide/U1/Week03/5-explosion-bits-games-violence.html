        <h2>Social Implications Lab 5: Explosion of Bits; Games and Violence</h2>
 
        <div class="todo">
        <ul>
            <li>From Dan in NY: "We talked briefly about how to teach the social implications (i.e., how to engage students in meaningful discussions, where only a few dominate and most are silent). Here was the result of that brainstorm (mostly from Sam, who said he had lots of experience):
            	<ul>
                	<li>Think, pair, share</li>
                    <li>Start by writing</li>
                    <li>As a particular student what they thought about another’s response</li>
                    <li>Encourage leadership (speak to the star, vocal participants and praise them for participating, and tell them it’s their job to encourage others to speak too, allow them to feel ownership of the class and the learning community)</li>
                    <li>Give “Pablo points” (positive rubs) for participation</li>
                    <li>Use techniques from Danielson’s “accountable talk”</li>
                    <li>Make sure they cite what they’re saying</li>
                    <li>Encourage them to respect what each other is saying</li>
                    <li>Have them do role playing "Ok, you’re a Google executive and you’re a privacy advocate — argue your side of the data collection debate"</li>
                </ul>
			</li>

			<li>From GH: A page with a lot of readings is hard to follow. All the links open in the same window so there's no easy way to go back. You can get distracted. Also doing all the reading in one page makes the pacing of the lab a bit weird -- one page usually conveys a similar amount of work but this psge iis long in comparison.</li>

        </div>

 
        
        <p>Students begin to see that there are many social implications to computing. The <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading highlights ways the world has been changed by computing and identifies examples that might not look at first like a "bits story" but is. In this lab, students get a range of experiences, including reading the book, beginning to compile a list of computing innovations, debating the hot topic of whether violent video games cause youth violence, and finding evidence for ways that technology can be both good and bad.</p> 
        <p>Activities related to finding and describing computing innovations helps prepare students for the Explore Performance Task. The writing and video exercises (such as making a video about an innovation, supporting a claim about privacy using evidence, supporting a claim about video games using evidence, and brainstorming evidence for claims about whether technology is good or bad) also prepare students for the Explore Task. Important AP topics that are addressed in this Lab include a preliminary exploration of bits and looking into a broad range of computing innovations.</p>
        
        <h3>A note about Social Implications Labs:</h3>
        <p>There is a lot of material presented on the student pages, including multiple options for discussing or otherwise exploring certain topics. It is not expected that every idea gets used.</p>

		<p><ul><li>There are many options for students to access <em>Blown to Bits</em>. They can read it as an <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter1.pdf">online PDF</a> or you may choose to purchase hard copies of the book. You may also photocopy the book for students so that they can make annotations as they read.</li></ul></p>

        	<ul>
            	<li><strong>Is technology good or bad?</strong> <a>Google doc</a><br>
                Technology is not all good or all bad. In this Snap Judgment assignment, look for ways that students use evidence to support claims they make about positive advancements or negative implications of technology. This is not meant to be a polished piece of writing, but should result in students thinking of examples to support their position. In class, they will read pages 13-17 of Blown to Bits which addresses both sides. [Also include link to BDL]</li>
                <li><strong>Should violent video games be sold to minors?</strong> <a>Google doc</a><br>
                This question is the subject of an article that students will read today in class. Students again must construct an argument to support a position. Emphasize the importance of providing reasons and considering counterarguments that might be made by the other side.</li>
                
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Read <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter1.pdf"><em>Blown to Bits</em></a> pages 1-4<br>
        <strong>Guiding Question</strong>: What does Tanya Rider's story have to do with the explosion of bits?</p>
        <p>Much of <em>Blown to Bits</em> has to do with the balance between the abundance of digital information and our attempts for retaining privacy and ownership of our own information. Have students read the selection with the guiding question in mind, then discuss briefly. Students may also be interested in looking up news stories or videos about Tanya Rider. Examples:
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/10247516.html">Sheriff apologizes to husband of trapped woman (Komo News)</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/09/experience-trapped-in-ravine">Experience: I was trapped in a ravine for eight days (The Guardian)</a></li></ul> </p>
            
            	
		<h3>Research</h3>
        <div class="sidenote"><strong>Looking ahead</strong><br>Next week students will form groups of 2-3, choose a computing innovation that interests them, and produce a short video that explains the innovation and some of its impacts. Eventually, students will use this experience to help them with their AP CS Principles Explore Task, about implications of computing innovations.</div>
        <p>Look through these lists of recent innovations:
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/a-world-transformed-what-are-the-top-30-innovations-of-the-last-30-years/">Wharton's top 30 innovations</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/12/tech/cnn10-ideas/?hpt=hp_t1">CNN's 10 ideas</a></li>
        </ul>
        Not all of these are computing innovations, but many are related to computing.</p>
        <p><strong>Guiding Question</strong>: Which of these innovations are you familiar with? Look up a few innovations that you are unfamiliar with to see what they do, what they are used for, and what kind of impact they have on the way we live.</p>
        <p>Note: You might encourage students to start their own Google doc to keep track of their findings. As they look up information online, encourage them to be in the habit of keeping track of and citing their sources.</p>
