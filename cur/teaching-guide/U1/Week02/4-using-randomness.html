	    <h2>Programming Lab 4: Block Types and Calculations</h2>
		<p>Students continute experimenting with and combining blocks as they formalize their understanding of command blocks (including loops and conditionals), reporter blocks (and watchers), and predicates (including booleans). After most of a unit of exploring a variety blocks, students now learn how block shapes relate to their functionality and how the different types of blocks tend to relate (reporters inside commands and other reporters, booleans inside predicates, predicates inside preciates, preciates inside conditionals, etc.). Students also explore a variety of math reporters (from the Operators palette) including basic operations, <code>random</code>, <code>mod</code>, and logical operators (<code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>) as they refine their understanding of block relationships. Students also do some introductory work with swapping variable values previewing more advanced programming tasks in upcoming units.</p> 
        

        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 4 lab pages could be split across three days. Expected times to complete follow: <ul>
                <li>20-25 minutes on Commands and Reporters</li>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Predicates, Conditionals, and Logic</li>
                <li>20-25 minutes on Operators</li>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Computing with Variables</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
