	    <h2>Programming Lab 4: Block Types and Calculations</h2>
		<p>Students continue experimenting with and combining blocks as they formalize their understanding of command blocks (including loops and conditionals), reporter blocks (and watchers), and predicates (including Boolean constant blocks). After most of a unit  exploring a variety of blocks, students now learn how block shapes relate to their functionality and how the different types of blocks tend to relate (reporters inside commands and other reporters, Booleans inside predicates, predicates inside predicates, predicates inside conditionals, etc.). Students also explore a variety of math reporters (from the Operators palette) including basic operations, <code>random</code>, <code>mod</code>, and logical operators (<code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>) as they refine their understanding of block relationships. </p> 
        

        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 3 lab pages could be split across two days. Expected times to complete follow: <ul>
                <li>20-25 minutes on Commands and Reporters</li>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Predicates, Conditionals, and Logic</li>
                <li>20-25 minutes on Operators</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
