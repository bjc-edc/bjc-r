        <h2>Computing in the News</h2>
        <p>Find appropriate news articles to share with the class. Choose a mix of news stories, some which show the promise of technology and others which expose negative aspects.</p>
        
        <p>As you present news stories, ask students to respond to them. Ask: 
        <ul>
        	<li>What are some of the implications of the subject of the article?</li>
            <li>Do you agree with the views presented?</li>
            <li>What ideas would you be interested in exploring further?</li>
        </ul></p>
                
        <h3>News Sources</h3>
