        <h2>Facilitating a Classroom Discussion</h2>
        <p>Your status as a teacher gives you  power that you will need to use and power you will want to relinquish. At first, you may need to be quite active to build participation and get students to <em>discuss</em>, both agreeing and disagreeing constructively, and with some system that keeps them from all talking at once or breaking into independent conversations. But, to get them to debate <em>with each other</em>, and not just to you, you need eventually not to be the person who responds to each student's statement before another student can chime in. The mid-path between running the show and allowing total chaos is tricky, as all of teaching is. You will find some practical ideas in chapter 6 of <em>Making Sense of Algebra</em> from Heinemann Publishers. Here are a few.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>As teacher, you obviously need to retain control that is needed but, otherwise, try to participate only as much as any participant's fair share of the air time in class. At first (and at times), you will need to participate more than "your share," but keep aiming at having students do the discussing.</li>
        	<li>Though you are <em>not</em> your students' peer, aim for <em>discussing</em> in the way you would with peers. That is, in a conversation with peers, you would not normally say "That's very good. What do other people think?" You might well say, "Oh, I never thought of that" or "I think that, too, but I heard a friend say____." You are <em>participating</em> in that discussion, not evaluating students' contributions.</li>
        	<li>Show <em>your</em> interest in what students say. One way to express genuine interest  is to be totally honest in your response, but remember to aim (over time) to respond only in your "fair share."</li>
        	<li>You can be sure that many of the things students say will be incomplete or unclear in some way. Again, you can express genuine interest without critique just by being totally honest: "I'm not sure I understand" or "Could you say a bit more about what you mean?" or "Did you mean ____ or ____?" </li>
        	<li>Sometimes sitting  at a student desk rather than standing (or sitting) in front of the class can get students facing each other and can reduce your role as the wall off which every ball bounces. Decide, of course, what is comfortable and natural for you.</li>
        	<li>Sometimes, recall what a student said earlier that may be more relevant now. "But wait, didn't Marta say earlier that____?" That can bring some controversy or richness <em>and also shows that you were listening to and noticing Marta and that you're interested.</em></li>
        	<li>If there's really nothing to discuss, the discussion will be boring.  </li>
        	<li>Feel free to challenge students' viewpoints and expand the debate, especially if students lean toward a collective bias. You are a participant and your ideas count, too. But remember you are one <em>n</em>th of the class. Don't let your automatic power as a teacher dominate more than you absolutely need in order to maintain order.</li>
            <li>Minimize rules that apply only to school and not to normal conversation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
<!--        <p><ul>
        	<li><strong>Research</strong>, 10-15 minutes in which students learn about a topic by reading an article or looking up information online</li>
			<li><strong>Sharing Student Work</strong>, a 10-15 minute class discussion in which students see the posted work of others to talk about different problem-solving approaches and common pitfalls, or just to showcase students' creativity</li> 
        </ul></p>

    <h3>Sensible norms for classroom discussion...</h3>
        
<p>The last suggestion was "Minimize rules that apply only to school and not to normal conversation," but this is a classroom with large numbers of people and so not quite a "normal" conversation. <em>Some</em> norms, all pretty obvious, are useful. Use or ignore the following ideas.</p>
<ul>
          
                    <li>We want to hear from as many people as possible. (It may make sense for students to raise their hands when they have something to say, and a facilitator - teacher or student - to write down students' names in order on the board. The students then know what order in which to speak, don't have to keep their hands raised, and the facilitator doesn't have to interrupt to call on people. In this case, it might also help to have a special sign students can make for when they would urgently like to respond to a comment, though this should be used sparingly.)</li>
                    <li>We will be discussing sensitive topics; we should treat all contributions with respect. We also know that people's views can change or may not come across as they intended, so we won't jump to conclusions about people's views from their short contributions here.</li>
                    <li>We want to keep a spirit of inquiry during discussion; this is not the time to insist on being "right."</li>
                    <li>We want to acknowledge each other's contributions and speak to each other, addressing each other by name.</li>
    </ul>
<p>You may want to ask students periodically what <em>they</em> think might help the discussions.</p>
        
        <h3>Other ways to engage students in meaningful discussion...</h3>
        <div class="sidenote">This list was generated by some of our field test teachers in New York.</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Think (give a moment to think first), pair (let students talk with one other student before being asked to speak publically), share (with the whole class)</li>
            <li>Encourage leadership (ask the most  vocal participants, at a discreet time, what <em>they</em> think might encourage others to speak more and how <em>they</em> might support the  learning community)</li>
            <li>Look up Danielson’s “accountable talk” and adapt ideas for yourself</li>
            <li>Have students role play: "Ok, you’re a Google executive and you’re a privacy advocate — argue your side of the data collection debate"</li>
        </ul>
