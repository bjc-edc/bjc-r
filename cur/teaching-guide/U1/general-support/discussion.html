        <h2>Facilitating a Classroom Discussion</h2>
        <p>Encourage constructive and rigorous debate. Ask questions to challenge students' viewpoints and expand the debate, especially if students lean toward a collective bias. Try to remain neutral and to instead focus on drawing out multiple views of the issues. Encourage and demonstrate research, citation, and following-up on prior discussions. </p>
        
<!--        <p><ul>
        	<li><strong>Research</strong>, 10-15 minutes in which students learn about a topic by reading an article or looking up information online</li>
			<li><strong>Sharing Student Work</strong>, a 10-15 minute class discussion in which students see the posted work of others to talk about different problem-solving approaches and common pitfalls, or just to showcase students' creativity</li> 
        </ul></p>

        <h3>Establish norms for classroom discussion...</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                Ask: <em>What are some important guidelines we should keep as a class?</em> Record these to refer back to in future discussions. Examples may include:
                <ul>
                    <li>We want to hear from as many people as possible. (It may make sense for students to raise their hands when they have something to say, and a facilitator - teacher or student - to write down students' names in order on the board. The students then know what order in which to speak, don't have to keep their hands raised, and the facilitator doesn't have to interrupt to call on people. In this case, it might also help to have a special sign students can make for when they would urgently like to respond to a comment, though this should be used sparingly.)</li>
                    <li>We will be discussing sensitive topics; we should treat all contributions with respect. We also know that people's views can change or may not come across as they intended, so we won't jump to conclusions about people's views from their short contributions here.</li>
                    <li>We want to keep a spirit of inquiry during discussion; this is not the time to insist on being "right."</li>
                    <li>We want to acknowledge each other's contributions and speak to each other, addressing each other by name.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        
        <h3>Other ways to engage students in meaningful discussion...</h3>
        <div class="sidenote">This list was generated by some of our field test teachers in New York.</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Think, pair, share</li>
            <li>Start by writing</li>
            <li>As a particular student what they thought about another’s response</li>
            <li>Encourage leadership (speak to the vocal participants and praise them for participating, and tell them it’s their job to encourage others to speak too, allow them to feel ownership of the class and the learning community)</li>
            <li>Give “Pablo points” (positive rubs) for participation</li>
            <li>Use techniques from Danielson’s “accountable talk”</li>
            <li>Make sure they cite what they’re saying</li>
            <li>Encourage them to respect what each other is saying</li>
            <li>Have them role play: "Ok, you’re a Google executive and you’re a privacy advocate — argue your side of the data collection debate"</li>
        </ul>
