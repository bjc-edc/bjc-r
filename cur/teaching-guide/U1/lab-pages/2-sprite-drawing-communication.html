    	<h2>Programming Lab 2: Sprite Drawing and Communication</h2>
        <p>In Lab 2, students explore block programming with a simple script to draw a square...</p>
		
        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 5 lab pages could be split across two or three days. Expected times to complete follow:
            <ul>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Exploring Snap Drawing and Motion</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Following with Sprites</li>
                <li>20-25 minutes on Sprites Interaction</li>
                <li>X-X minutes on Drawing with Two Sprites</li>
                <li>X-X minutes on More Sprite Drawing and Interaction</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

		<h3>Prepare:</h3>

                <li>Prepare a <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> story.</li>
            	<li>Prepare several other <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/openers.html" target="_blank">Openers</a>.</li>
                <li>Make sure students know the procedure for doing turning in homework, especially if they will do this assignment online.</li>

        	<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
            <ul>
            	<li>Drawing the square will lead to writing a command called "drawSquare" later in the Unit.</li>
                <li>Students learn more about x- and y-positions in the Unit 1 Kaleidoscope project.</li>
                <li>Students will explore the <code>repeat</code> block more formally in <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-control-commands/1-the-repeat-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment" target="_blank">Lab 2</a>.</li>

        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Explore the <span class="snap">snap</span> interface and command blocks.</li>
                <li>Practice pair and team programming, create individual <span class="snap">snap</span> accounts, and learn to save and open <span class="snap">snap</span> projects.</li>
                <li>
                	Create, discuss, and experiment this script to draw a square:<br />

        	<div class="comment">
        	  <p>Brian (or anyone), is there (or can you suggest) a more specific strategy for this? -MF</p>
        	  <p>BH: Not yet. We're working on support for class submissions in the Snap<em>!</em> back end.</p>
        	</div>
            <li>Students can pick up where they left off with the Hour of Code by opening the last step they had completed, clicking "Show me the answer," and then advancing to the next step that they have not started.</li>
            <li><strong>Saving, Submitting, and Sharing Projects in <span class="snap">snap</span></strong> Find a method for students to submit <span class="snap">snap</span> projects that makes sense to you. Here's one suggestion: In <span class="snap">snap</span>, students can choose "Export project..." from the file menu. This brings up text in XML. Students can right-click on the page and "Save As..." to a local folder. Give students directions on naming their files (e.g. Kaleidoscope-first-last.xml), then have them send this file to you. When you go to display their work, you can open <span class="snap">snap</span>, then choose "Import..." and the file.</li>
            <li>Take note of interesting approaches or creative ideas that would be interesting to share. Consider also asking students to submit yet-incomplete kaleidoscope or animation projects (give them some way of indicating this in the file name) if you see an interesting intermediate attempt that would spark discussion.</li>
        </ul></p>
