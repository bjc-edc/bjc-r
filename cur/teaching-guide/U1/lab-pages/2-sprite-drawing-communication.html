    	<h2>Programming Lab 2: Sprite Drawing and Communication</h2>
        <p>In Lab 2, students explore block programming with sprites. Students write a simple script to draw a square and then modify the input values and discuss the results. They create scripts in which sprites follow each other or follow the mouse. And they get a first look at more complicated programming structures such as loops and conditionals</p>
		
        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 5 lab pages could be split across two or three days. Expected times to complete follow:
            <ul>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Exploring Snap Drawing and Motion</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Following with Sprites</li>
                <li>20-25 minutes on Sprites Interaction</li>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Drawing with Two Sprites</li>
                <li>5-10 minutes on More Sprite Drawing and Interaction</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

		<h3>Prepare:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Review the <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html" target="_blank">Unit 1 Student Programming Lab 2, Sprite Drawing and Communication</a>.</li>
                <li>Prepare a <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> story.</li>
            	<li>Prepare several other <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/openers.html" target="_blank">Openers</a>.</li>
                <li>Make sure students know the procedure for doing turning in homework, especially if they will do this assignment online.</li>

        	<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
            <ul>
            	<li>Drawing the square will lead to writing a command called "drawSquare" later in the Unit.</li>
                <li>Students learn more about x- and y-positions in the Unit 1 Kaleidoscope project.</li>
                <li>Students will explore the <code>repeat</code> block more formally in <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-control-commands/1-the-repeat-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment" target="_blank">Lab 2</a>.</li>

                <li>
                	Create, discuss, and experiment this script to draw a square:<br />

		<h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Work through the <a href="/bjc-r/llab/html/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html" target="_blank">Programming Lab 2, Sprite Drawing and Communication</a> and the relevant Week 1 <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/extras/W01-activities.html" target="_blank">Activities</a>.</li>
                <li>Consider working through the Week 1 <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/extras/W01-assignments.html" target="_blank">Assignments</a> that you don't assign as homework together as a class.</li>

        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take note of any interesting approaches or creative ideas that would be interesting to share. Consider also asking students to submit yet-incomplete projects (giving them some way of indicating this in the file name) if you see an interesting intermediate attempt that could spark discussion.</li>
            </ul>
