    	<h2>Programming Lab 2: Sprite Drawing and Communication</h2>
        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-square.png" alt="pen down, repeat 4 (move 50 steps, turn CW 90 degrees)" title="pen down, repeat 4 (move 50 steps, turn CW 90 degrees)" />
        <p>In Lab 2, students explore block programming with sprites. Students write a simple script to draw a square and then modify the input values and discuss the results. They work with multiples, creating scripts in which sprites follow each other or follow the mouse around the stage. And they code with more complicated programming structures such as loops and conditionals.</p>
		<p>In this lab, students deepen their experience with loops and conditionals still without formalizing. Resist the urge to "teach" these concepts and instead allow time for students to explore and discover how things work on their own. Lab 3: Control Commands codifies this learning.</p>
        
		
        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 5 lab pages could be split across two or three days. Expected times to complete follow:
            <ul>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Exploring Snap Drawing and Motion</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Following with Sprites</li>
                <li>20-25 minutes on Sprites Interaction</li>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Drawing with Two Sprites</li>
                <li>5-10 minutes on More Sprite Drawing and Interaction</li>

	                    <li>Students could <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/7-loading-mobile-device.html" target="_blank">share their project</a> and email you the link, or</li>
                        <li>They could export the project from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu, save the XML file, and email that to you as an attachment or upload it to a website that you manage for the class. You can then download the file and import it through the Snap<em>!</em> File menu.</li>

		<h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Work through the <a href="/bjc-r/llab/html/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html" target="_blank">Programming Lab 2, Sprite Drawing and Communication</a> and the relevant Week 1 <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/extras/W01-activities.html" target="_blank">Activities</a> including the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/extras/W01-activities.html#discussion" target="_blank">discussion on Pair Programming</a>.</li>
                <li>Consider working through the Week 1 <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/extras/W01-assignments.html" target="_blank">Assignments</a> that you don't assign as homework together as a class.</li>

        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <div class="comment">Paul, would you like to include a few words about pseudocode here? --MF</div>
        <div class="comment">Paul, something about snap comments too? --MF</div>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Several blocks that students will use in Unit 1 including <code>tell</code> and <code>for</code> are only available after importing tools from the Snap<em>!</em>File menu. This may change in a forthcoming update to Snap<em>!</em>, but for now remind students to import tools if a block they seek appears to be missing. Reminders appear in the following Unit 1 lab pages: <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-drawing-communication/3-sprite-interaction.html" target="_blank">Sprite Interaction
</a> and <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-control-commands/3-the-for-block.html" target="_blank">The <code>For</code> Block</a>.</li>
                <li>The first page of this lab gives students a simple script to draw a square and asks them to experiment with it, changing various numbers in the script and observing the results. Students who are accustomed to being told exactly what to do may flounder; remind them that Creativity is one of the CSP Big Ideas, and that there are no wrong answers to this sort of exploratory lesson.</li>
                <li>Take note of any interesting approaches or creative ideas that would be interesting to share. Consider also asking students to submit yet-incomplete projects (giving them some way of indicating this in the file name) if you see an interesting intermediate attempt that could spark discussion.</li>
                <li>In this lab there are a couple of handwavy algorithm descriptions looking like this:<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/white-box.png" width="458" height="123" alt="not-quite-code in white background box"> Please avoid describing this as &quot;pseudocode,&quot; and <em>definitely </em>don't ask students to write pseudocode! We use these code descriptions <em>sparingly</em> as a pedagogic tool when we want to avoid telling students exactly how to code something, not because we think programmers should write things like this. &quot;Pseudocode&quot; is used by people who have to cope with terrible programming languages that are so loaded with syntax that actual code is unreadable. There's nothing beautiful or joyful about it.</li>
                <li>On the page &quot;Sprite Interaction&quot; is this code: <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Russian.png" width="455" height="204" alt="text in Creole and Russian"> The intent is to encourage bilingual (especially ESL) students to use whatever language they're comfortable with. Be on the lookout for students who've gotten into the habit of unthinkingly parroting whatever they see, and who will get stuck trying to enter Russian characters. Tell them to loosen up!</li>
                <li>The page &quot;More Sprite Drawing and Interaction&quot; shows Snap<em>!</em> code with comments attached. Please don't force students to comment their code. This isn't a software engineering course preparing students for the workforce; keep it joyful.</li>
                <li>Take It Further activities include work with sprite costumes, introduce adding a stage background, and go deeper with angles. Look to the students who complete the activities with angles on the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-drawing-communication/4-drawing-two-sprites.html" target="_blank">Drawing with Two Sprites</a> page to support <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/lab-pages/3-control-commands.html#angles" target="_blank">discussions about angles in Lab 3: Control Commands</a>.</li>
