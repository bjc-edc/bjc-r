    	<h2>Programming Lab 2: Sprite Drawing and Communication</h2>
        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-square.png" alt="pen down, repeat 4 (move 50 steps, turn CW 90 degrees)" title="pen down, repeat 4 (move 50 steps, turn CW 90 degrees)" />
        <p>In Lab 2, students explore block programming with sprites. Students write a simple script to draw a square and then modify the input values and discuss the results. They work with multiples, creating scripts in which sprites follow each other or follow the mouse around the stage. And they code with more complicated programming structures such as loops and conditionals.</p>
		<p>In this lab, students deepen their experience with loops and conditionals still without formalizing. Resist the urge to "teach" these concepts and instead allow time for students to explore and discover how things work on their own. Lab 3: Control Commands codifies this learning.</p>
        
		
        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 5 lab pages could be split across two or three days (65-90 minutes). Expected times to complete follow:
            <ul>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Exploring Snap Drawing and Motion</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Following with Sprites</li>
                <li>20-25 minutes on Sprites Interaction</li>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Drawing with Two Sprites</li>
                <li>5-10 minutes on More Sprite Drawing and Interaction</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

		<h3>Prepare:</h3>

        	<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Drawing the square will lead to writing a command called "drawSquare" later in the Unit.</li>
                <li>Students learn more about x- and y-positions in the Unit 1 Kaleidoscope project.</li>
                <li>Students will explore loops such as <code>forever</code> and <code>repeat</code> more formally in <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-control-commands/1-the-repeat-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment" target="_blank">Lab 3</a>.</li>

                </li>
                <li>Create programs with multiple sprites, and program sprites to control the behavior of other sprites using the <code>tell</code> command.</li>
                <li>Use conditional statements to perform commands under certain circumstances such as <code>repeat until</code> the sprite is <code>touching?</code> another object on the stage.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Several blocks that students will use in Unit 1 including <code>tell</code> and <code>for</code> are  available only after importing tools from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu. This may change in a forthcoming update to Snap<em>!</em>, but for now remind students to import tools if a block they seek appears to be missing. </li>

                	To launch Lab 2&mdash;Make a Prediction: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UlHWatINw9crcqeA0hjDb1n-toPSNtmSfegBM5zXCbw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Repeat, Move, Turn</a>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Project the script and ask students to predict what it does (discuss in small groups and/or as a class).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The first page of this lab gives students a simple script to draw a square and asks them to experiment with it, changing various numbers in the script and observing the results. Students who are accustomed to being told exactly what to do may flounder. Tell them that Creativity is one of the CSP Big Ideas, and that in this sort of exploratory lesson there are no wrong answers.</li>
                <li>Take note of any interesting approaches or creative ideas that would be good to share with the class.</li>
                <li>In this lab there are a couple of handwavy algorithm descriptions looking like this:<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/white-box.png" width="458" height="123" alt="not-quite-code in white background box"> Please avoid describing this as &quot;pseudocode,&quot; and <em>definitely </em>don't ask students to write pseudocode! We use these code descriptions <em>sparingly</em> as a pedagogic tool when we want to avoid telling students exactly how to code something, not because we think programmers should write things like this. &quot;Pseudocode&quot; is used by people who have to teach using programming languages so loaded with syntax that the algorithm can't be found in actual code. There's nothing beautiful or joyful about it.
                  <ul>
                <li>Also, especially for beginners, trying to program in English can lead to &quot;algorithms&quot; that can't actually be implemented in code, such as this example:<pre>to find the square root of x
  return result such that
    result * result = x</pre></li></ul></li>
                <li>On the page &quot;Sprite Interaction&quot; is this code: <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Russian.png" width="455" height="204" alt="text in Creole and Russian"> The intent is to encourage bilingual (especially ESL) students to use whatever language they're comfortable with. Be on the lookout for students who've gotten into the habit of unthinkingly parroting whatever they see. They may get stuck trying to enter Russian characters. Tell them to use their own creativity!</li>
                <li>The page <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-drawing-communication/5-more-drawing-interaction.html" target="_blank">More Sprite Drawing and Interaction</a> shows Snap<em>!</em> code with comments attached. Please don't require students to comment their code. This isn't a software engineering course preparing students for the workforce; keep it joyful.</li>
