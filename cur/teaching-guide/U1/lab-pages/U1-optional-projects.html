		<h2>Optional Projects</h2>
		<p>These optional programming projects are designed to supplement the required lab pages. There are many options for using these projects, and they depend on your pacing through the curriculum and the students in your class. You may decide to have each student select one project, or you may have them each build several. You may have students work individually, or you may have them pair program. You may have them work on their own time, or you may allocate class time for these projects.</p> 
		

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>

                            <ul>
								<li>The key idea is that very slight modifications to an algorithm can have huge effects.</li>
								<li>The secondary idea is to learn to experiment to see what an algorithm can do.</li>
                                <li>A key "computational thinking" goal is to see how a computer program can model a human action, in this case, the <em>style</em> of an artist. The language project(s) in unit 2 have the same goal.</li>

                            <ul>
								<li>Encourage experimentation and creativity.</li>
								<li>Possibly collect student artworks and display them.</li>
                                <li>The programming here is quite light; the focus is mostly on experimentation and creativity. This project can easily follow the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/1-exploring-motion.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Exploring Motion">Exploring Motion </a> even though it uses <code>for</code> which doesn't appear until page 6 of the lab, Looping with a Counter.</li>

                            <strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
                            <ul>
								<li>Extend work of Gossip project to build simple and complex sentences.</li>
								<li>Practice building blocks, selecting random items from lists, and using custom bocks within other custom blocks (a form of abstraction).</li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Tips:</strong>
                            <ul>
								<li>Students&mdash;especially English Language Learners&mdash;might not be famliar with the some or all of the terms: noun, verb, adjective, adverb, determiner (articles and pronouns), and preposition. This is not the focus of the project, and so a note has been provided on the page and examples have been provided in the blocks included.</li>
                                <li>Students may find that the determiners chosed randomly by the computer don't match their nouns (for example, "a old dog" instead of "an old dog"). They can choose to ignore that for now or to build code that uses <code>letter of</code> and <code>if</code> to choose the correct determiner, though this is a more complicated task consdiering that students aren't formall introduced to predicates and conditionals until Unit 2.</li>
                            </ul>

                <div class="todo">Many of these projects use the green flag block. I think that's appropriate for Pages 1 and 2, but not for Pages 3 or 4. Also, the code in the Page 4 solution could stand to be cleaned up; I don't know where to look first. --MF, 3/19/18 Also the solution files have the wrong format (should start with "U1-Optional" and end with "(andwer file)"). --MF, 4/3/19</div>
