		<h2>Optional Projects</h2>
		<p>Optional programming projects help show the breadth of applications of content from the required lab pages and are aimed to appeal to diverse interests. But don't forget that the optional projects are <em>optional!</em> If you're having trouble fitting the curriculum into the school year, these are the first things to go.</p>
		<p>You can assign a project to the entire class, or you can just let students know they exist, and let them take on projects if they have extra time.</p>
		<p>Not all these projects are equally fruitful. Some of the art-related ones have been eclipsed by the art projects in the Take It Further sections of Lab 3. &quot;The Game of Pong&quot; is a relatively easy project, related to the ideas of Lab 5, that results in a quickly implemented game. &quot;Modeling language,&quot; which logically follows Lab 2, continues the idea of Gossip but with a more detailed grammar.</p>

								<li>This  may appeal to students with interests in languages or linguistics. Students&mdash;especially English Language Learners&mdash;might not be familiar with the technical grammatical terms: noun, verb, adjective, adverb, determiner (articles and pronouns), and preposition. This is not the focus of the project; a note on the page explains them informally and the blocks in the startup file provide examples.</li>
                                <li>Students may find that the determiners chosen randomly by the computer don't match their nouns (for example, &quot;a old dog&quot; instead of &quot;an old dog&quot;). They can decide to   ignore that for now or to build code that uses <code>letter of</code> and <code>if</code> to choose the correct determiner, though this is a more complicated task considering that students aren't formally introduced to predicates and conditionals until Unit 2.</li>
