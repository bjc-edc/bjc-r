		<h2>Optional Projects</h2>
		<p>Optional programming projects help show the breadth of applications of content from the required lab pages and are aimed to appeal to diverse interests. But don't forget that the optional projects are <em>optional!</em> If you're having trouble fitting the curriculum into the school year, these are the first things to go.</p>
		<p>You can assign a project to the entire class, or you can just let students know they exist, and let them take on projects if they have extra time.</p>
		<p>Not all these projects are equally fruitful. &quot;The Game of Pong&quot; is a relatively easy project, related to the ideas of Lab 5, that results in a quickly implemented game. &quot;Modeling language,&quot; which logically follows Lab 2, continues the idea of Gossip but with a more detailed grammar.</p>

                            <ul>
								<li>This  may appeal to students with interests in languages or linguistics. Students&mdash;especially English Language Learners&mdash;might not be familiar with the technical grammatical terms: noun, verb, adjective, adverb, determiner (articles and pronouns), and preposition. This is not the focus of the project; a note on the page explains them informally and the blocks in the startup file provide examples.</li>
                                <li>Students may find that the determiners chosen randomly by the computer don't match their nouns (for example, &quot;a old dog&quot; instead of &quot;an old dog&quot;). They can decide to   ignore that for now or to build code that uses <code>letter of</code> and <code>if</code> to choose the correct determiner, though this is a more complicated task considering that students aren't formally introduced to predicates and conditionals until Unit 2.</li>
                            </ul>

					<strong>Goals for the Lab: Page 3: Modeling Sentence Structures.</strong>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Use the <code>join</code> and <code>join words</code> blocks.</li>
                    	<li>Algorithmically select from lists.</li>
                		<li>Randomly choose items from lists of words to make a Sentence Builder.</li>

                	<strong>As a Class: Page 3: Modeling Sentence Structures.</strong>
                	<ul>
                    	<li>The page is designed to offer a fun mini-project in which the use of lists feels natural and empowering. Encourage students to be creative and build other kinds of sentences or even simple conversations.</li>
                        <li>This lesson relies on proficiency in programming more than knowledge of English sentence structure. For this kind of project, English is particularly easy because it has hardly any inflections (case, tense, mood, etc.), but students may try this project in a language other than English, if they like. Languages present different challenges but students can adjust their lists or their coding to make the project work. Students could work with others or alone and then share. Be creative. For example, it might be beneficial to pair a student studying Spanish with a fluent Spanish speaker. </li>
                        <li>As always, if students do interesting work (e.g. with another language or with the Take It Further problems), consider inviting them to share with the class.</li>
		                <li>Discussion, you might ask: How do the sentence builder blocks demonstrate abstraction?</li>

                    	<li>The English grammar on this page may be too complex for some English Language Learners to stay focused on the computer science. On the other hand, English is the least inflected natural language, and even an ESL student may find the <em>programming</em> easier in English.</li>
