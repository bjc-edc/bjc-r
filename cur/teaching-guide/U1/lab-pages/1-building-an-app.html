    	<h2>Programming Lab 1: Building an App</h2>
        <img class="imageRight noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alonzo-flip.gif" alt="Alonzo sprite turning around" title="Alonzo sprite turning around" />
        <p>Students go right into working with <span class="snap">snap</span> in the very first class by building a simple game. Consider giving students 30-40 minutes to explore the lab in pairs <em>before</em> taking care of mandatory first-day business. In Lab 1, students set up their <span class="snap">snap</span> accounts for saving projects and build and share a game in which users try to click on Alonzo (at right) as he moves around the screen.</p>
		<p>As the year begins, it is important that students know what is expected of them. Labs are intended to be times during which students work at their own pace in pairs. They should know that they are responsible for getting through the material in the section, but that they are also free to explore and create if something of interest to them. Expect glitches, and also model the necessary patience and perseverance necessary to work with new technology.</p> 

        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 7 lab pages could be split across one or two days (45-65 minutes). Expected times to complete follow:
            <ul>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Creating a Snap! Account</li>
                <li>5-10 minutes on Starting Your First Snap! App</li>
                <li>approx. 1 minute on Pair Programming Swap</li>
                <li>5-10 minutes on Using the Random Block</li>
                <li>approx. 5 minutes on Saving in Snap!</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Finishing Your First Snap! App</li>
                <li>approx. 5 minutes on Sharing Your App and Loading It on a Mobile Device</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

	<h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
            <li>Create your own <span class="snap">snap</span> account.  Instructions are on 
              <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/1-creating-a-snap-account.html">this student page</a>.<li>Students need an email account to create a <span class="snap">snap</span> account.
            <ul><li>School email accounts are fine if they accept incoming mail from outside of the school network.</li>
          <li>Otherwise, if it is possible for you to communicate with students before school starts, ask them to be sure they know their email address and password on the first day.</li>
           <li>In case students have no email address or can't remember it, one solution is to use a free temporary email service &mdash; do a web search for &quot;temporary email,&quot; but be sure your network doesn't block connections to the site you select.</li>
           <li>Note for middle school teachers: If a student under age 13 creates an account, the dialog box asks for a parent's email rather than the student's own email. This is a legal requirement for <span class="snap">snap</span> to be compliant with the COPPA, but of course it'll still work with the student's own account if that's easier for you to manage.</li>
           </ul>              
              <li>The article <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/25304465" target="_blank">How Pair Programming Really Works</a> by Stuart Wray, which is recommended on the student page about pair programming, is particularly important for teachers. It calls into question the &quot;driver/navigator&quot; metaphor everyone uses to explain pair programming to students, with research showing a more complex social interaction between partners. The article is about professional programmers, not students, but many of its ideas are applicable in the classroom.</li>
              <li>Once you've set up your <span class="snap">snap</span> account, you can probably do the actual programming work of this lab in 20 minutes. (Later labs are more dense, and ask students to reflect on why they're doing what they're doing, but in this first lab the goal is for them to achieve a result that will excite and encourage them, without worrying about details.) We definitely recommend doing this lab yourself before class.</li>

    <h3>Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
                <!-- Is this needed with the new Lab 1 pages from the HOC? --Mary
                <li><strong>Saving, Submitting, and Sharing Projects in <span class="snap">snap</span></strong> Find a method for students to submit <span class="snap">snap</span> projects that makes sense to you. Here's one suggestion: In <span class="snap">snap</span>, students can choose "Export project..." from the file menu. This brings up text in XML. Students can right-click on the page and "Save As..." to a local folder. Give students directions on naming their files (e.g. Kaleidoscope-first-last.xml), then have them send this file to you. When you go to display their work, you can open <span class="snap">snap</span>, then choose "Import..." and the file.</li>-->
                <li>A few students will have unpredictable problems creating their <span class="snap">snap</span> accounts.  To avoid letting these problems eat up the entire class period, take advantage of pair programming; it's okay if one member of a pair doesn't have an account yet.  You can work with the non-account students after class to get over that hurdle.  (Even better, if you can wangle a teaching assistant or two from last year's students, this would be a great thing for them to handle during the first class.)
                <li>The actual pair programming swap that comes partway through the project should be quick, but you'll have to devote a few minutes to discussing how pairs are supposed to work; specifically, that the partner whose hands aren't on the keyboard and mouse mustn't zone out! Successful pairs are constantly talking.
      <li>In the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/4-using-the-random-block.html" target="_blank">Using the <code>Random</code> Block</a> page, students must "Add a line of code so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he not only turns, but also moves to a random position (between -190 and 190 in the x direction and between -130 and 130 in the y direction)." This may be a challenge for some students. In the spirit of this first lab, it's not so important that students understand coordinate axes. If not, just have them follow the instructions literally: a random number between -190 and 190 for X, a random number between -130 and 130 for Y. The use of coordinate axes, like everything in this first lab, will be revisited in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/5-block-types-calculations/1-sprite-position-direction.html" target="new">Lab 5</a>.</li>
      <li>In the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/6-finish-your-first-snap-app.html" target="new">Finishing Your First Snap<em>!</em> App</a> page comes the first &quot;Take It Further&quot; with suggested programming activities: in this case, ways to make the game more interesting. Be sure students understand both that these exercises are not required and that if they finish a page ahead of schedule they don't have to wait for permission to start on the Take It Further.</li>
      <li>On that same page, there is a subtle point about the difference between the green flag and the stop button. These two buttons are not exact opposites; don't think &quot;green starts the project and red stops it.&quot; The stop button forcibly stops all currently running scripts. The green flag doesn't forcibly start all scripts; it merely provides a signal that scripts can use as a starting condition if they want. Some projects ignore the green flag entirely, and start in some other way, e.g., by clicking a button-shaped sprite on the stage. You don't have to explain all this to students! But a student might ask why clicking the flag doesn't start all scripts. (Another related possibly confusing point is that the stop button doesn't prevent scripts from starting after it's clicked. Scripts can start in response to clicking a sprite, hitting a keyboard letter, and so on.)</li>
