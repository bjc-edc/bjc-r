    	<h2>Programming Lab 1: Building an App</h2>
        <p>Students go right into working with <span class="snap">snap</span> in the very first class. Consider giving students 30-40 minutes to explore the lab in pairs <em>before</em> taking care of mandatory first-day business. In Lab 1, students set up their <span class="snap">snap</span> accounts for saving projects and build and share a simple game.</p>
		<p>As the year begins, it is important that students know what is expected of them. Labs are intended to be times during which students work at their own pace in pairs. They should know that they are responsible for getting through the material in the section, but that they are also free to explore and create if something of interest to them. Expect glitches, and also model the necessary patience and perseverance necessary to work with new technology.</p> 

        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 7 lab pages could be split across one or two days. Expected times to complete follow:
            <ul>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Creating a Snap! Account</li>
                <li>5-10 minutes on Starting Your First Snap! App</li>
                <li>approx. 1 minute on Pair Programming Swap</li>
                <li>5-10 minutes on Using the Random Block</li>
                <li>approx. 5 minutes on Saving in Snap!</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Finishing Your First Snap! App</li>
                <li>approx. 5 minutes on Sharing Your App and Loading It on a Mobile Device</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <!-- Is this needed with the new Lab 1 pages from the HOC? --Mary
                <li><strong>Saving, Submitting, and Sharing Projects in <span class="snap">snap</span></strong> Find a method for students to submit <span class="snap">snap</span> projects that makes sense to you. Here's one suggestion: In <span class="snap">snap</span>, students can choose "Export project..." from the file menu. This brings up text in XML. Students can right-click on the page and "Save As..." to a local folder. Give students directions on naming their files (e.g. Kaleidoscope-first-last.xml), then have them send this file to you. When you go to display their work, you can open <span class="snap">snap</span>, then choose "Import..." and the file.</li>-->
                <li>In the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/4-using-the-random-block.html" target="_blank">Using the <code>Random</code> Block</a> lab, students must "Add a line of code so that every time Alonzo is clicked he not only turns, but also moves to a random position (between -190 and 190 in the x direction and between -130 and 130 in the y direction)." This may be a challenge for some students. Suggest that students re-watch the brief animation included in the lab pages and that they consider how to code the desired <em>x</em>-position (a random number between -190 and 190) and desired <em>y</em>-position (a random number between -130 and 130) separately. Encourage students to break down complex ideas.</li>
