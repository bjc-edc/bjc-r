    	<h2>Programming Lab 1: Building an App</h2>
        <p>Students go right into working with <span class="snap">snap</span> in the very first class. Consider giving students 30-40 minutes to explore the lab in pairs <em>before</em> taking care of mandatory first-day business. In Lab 1, students set up their <span class="snap">snap</span> accounts for saving projects and build and share a simple game.</p>
		<p>As the year begins, it is important that students know what is expected of them. Labs are intended to be times during which students work at their own pace in pairs. They should know that they are responsible for getting through the material in the section, but that they are also free to explore and create if something of interest to them. Expect glitches, and also model the necessary patience and perseverance necessary to work with new technology.</p> 

        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 7 lab pages could be split across two days. Expected times to complete follow:
            <ul>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Create a Snap! Account</li>
                <li>5-10 minutes on Start Your First Snap! App</li>
                <li>&tilde;1 minute on Pair Programming Swap</li>
                <li>5-10 minutes on Using the Random Block</li>
                <li>&tilde;5 minutes on Saving in Snap!</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Finish Your First Snap! App</li>
                <li>&tilde;5 minutes on Sharing Your App and Loading It on a Mobile Device</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

		<h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>

                <li>Review the <a href="http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment" target="_blank">Unit 1 Student Programming Lab 1</a>.</li>

Saving Tips"</a> link -- it's way too scary.  It says you always have to save <em>and</em> export, and you also have to have a Drive or Dropbox to back up to.  The cloud is really reliable these days, and we should just say to save to the cloud.  Also in some cases Firefox does better than Chrome, so we shouldn't build a browser recommendation into the curriculum.</div>

        	  <p>Brian (or anyone), is there (or can you suggest) a more specific strategy for this? -MF</p>
        	  <p>BH: Not yet. We're working on support for class submissions in the Snap<em>!</em> back end.</p>
        	</div>
            <li>Students can pick up where they left off with the Hour of Code by opening the last step they had completed, clicking "Show me the answer," and then advancing to the next step that they have not started.</li>
            <li><strong>Saving, Submitting, and Sharing Projects in <span class="snap">snap</span></strong> Find a method for students to submit <span class="snap">snap</span> projects that makes sense to you. Here's one suggestion: In <span class="snap">snap</span>, students can choose "Export project..." from the file menu. This brings up text in XML. Students can right-click on the page and "Save As..." to a local folder. Give students directions on naming their files (e.g. Kaleidoscope-first-last.xml), then have them send this file to you. When you go to display their work, you can open <span class="snap">snap</span>, then choose "Import..." and the file.</li>
            <li>Take note of interesting approaches or creative ideas that would be interesting to share. Consider also asking students to submit yet-incomplete kaleidoscope or animation projects (give them some way of indicating this in the file name) if you see an interesting intermediate attempt that would spark discussion.</li>
