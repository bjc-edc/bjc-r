        <p>Students set up their <span class="snap">snap</span> accounts and so that they can save their projects and then dive right into programming, in the very first class, by building a game that they can then play on their smart phone and share with others. The game is to click on Alonzo (at right) as he moves increasingly quickly around the screen. So that students get the immediate excitement of building their own app, consider postponing as much introductory material (e.g., establishing classroom routines) as possible until after Lab 1. Try to preserve at least half of the first lesson to let them get started building the game, working in pairs, <em>before</em> taking care of other first-day business.</p>

It calls into question the "driver/navigator" metaphor everyone uses to explain pair programming to students, with research showing a more complex social interaction between partners. The article is about professional programmers, not students, but many of its ideas are applicable in the classroom.</li>
                <li><strong>We definitely recommend doing this lab yourself before class.</strong> Once you've set up your <span class="snap">snap</span> account, you can probably do the actual programming work of this lab in 25 minutes.

        <h3>Tips:</h3>
    	<div>
        	<ul>
                <!-- Is this needed with the new Lab 1 pages from the HOC? --Mary
                <li><strong>Saving, Submitting, and Sharing Projects in <span class="snap">snap</span></strong> Find a method for students to submit <span class="snap">snap</span> projects that makes sense to you. Here's one suggestion: In <span class="snap">snap</span>, students can choose "Export project..." from the file menu. This brings up text in XML. Students can right-click on the page and "Save As..." to a local folder. Give students directions on naming their files (e.g. Kaleidoscope-first-last.xml), then have them send this file to you. When you go to display their work, you can open <span class="snap">snap</span>, then choose "Import..." and the file.</li>-->
                <li>A few students will have unpredictable problems creating  <span class="snap">snap</span> accounts.  To avoid letting these problems eat up the entire  period, take advantage of pair programming; it's okay if one member of a pair doesn't have an account yet.  You can work with the non-account students after class to get over that hurdle.  (Even better, if you can wrangle a teaching assistant or two from last year's students, this would be a great thing for them to handle during the first class.)</li>
                <li>
                	<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /> 
					The actual pair programming swap that comes partway through the project should be quick, but you'll have to devote a few minutes to discussing how pairs are supposed to work; specifically, the partner whose hands aren't on the keyboard should be actively contributing. Successful pairs are constantly talking.
                </li>
				<li>In the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/4-using-the-random-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Using the <code>Random</code> Block</a> page, students must "Add a line of code so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he not only turns, but also moves to a random position." The coordinate axes may be a challenge for some students. In the spirit of this first lab, it's not so important that students the Snap<em>!</em> understand coordinate axes now, and if they don't, just have them follow the instructions literally: a random number between -190 and 190 for X, a random number between -130 and 130 for Y. The use of coordinate axes, like everything in this first lab, will be revisited later.</li>
				<li>
                	Be sure students understand that are expected to read all the material presented and complete all the "For You To Do" problems with only the following exceptions:
                	<ol>
                    	<li>Yellow boxes are optional reading.</li>
                     	<li>"If There Is Time..." and "Take It Further" problems are not required. (These are provided for students to work on after finishing the required reading and problems. "If There Is Time..." problems are generally about as difficult as "For You To Do" problems, but "Take It Further" problems are often harder. If pairs have finished their assigned work, they can go head and start on some of these extra problems and don't have to wait for permission.)</li>
                   </ol>
                </li>
				<li>There is a subtle difference between the green flag and the stop button. These two buttons are not exact opposites; don't think "green starts the project and red stops it." The stop button <em>forcibly</em> stops all currently running scripts. The green flag doesn't forcibly start all scripts; it merely provides a signal that students <em>can</em> use, if they want, as a starting condition for a script. Some projects ignore the green flag entirely, and start in some other way, e.g., by clicking a button-shaped sprite on the stage. You don't have to explain all this to students, but a student might ask why clicking the flag doesn't start all scripts. (Another related possibly confusing point is that the stop button doesn't prevent scripts from starting after it's clicked. Scripts can start in response to clicking a sprite, hitting a keyboard letter, and so on.)</li>
