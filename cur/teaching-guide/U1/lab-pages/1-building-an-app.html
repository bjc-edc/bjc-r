        <h2>Lab 1: Sprite Programming</h2>
        <img class="imageRight noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alonzo-flip.gif" alt="Alonzo sprite turning around" title="Alonzo sprite turning around" />
        <p>Students set up their <span class="snap">snap</span> accounts and so that they can save their projects and then dive right into programming, in the very first class, by building a game that they can then play on their smart phone and share with others. The game is to click on Alonzo (at right) as he moves increasingly quickly around the screen. So that students get the immediate excitement of building their own app, consider postponing as much introductory material (e.g., establishing classroom routines) as possible until after Lab 1. Try to preserve at least half of the first lesson to let them get started building the game, working in pairs, <em>before</em> taking care of other first-day business.</p>
        
        <h3>Pacing:</h3>
        <div class="sidenote">These estimates are for the lab pages only. Additional time will be required for Computing the News or other activities.</div>

        	The 7 lab pages could be split across 3-5 days (<strong>100-195 minutes</strong>). Expected times to complete follow:

        <h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>

                <li><strong>Create your own <span class="snap">snap</span> account.</strong>  Instructions are on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/1-creating-a-snap-account.html">this student page</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>We definitely recommend doing this lab yourself before class.</strong> Once you've set up your <span class="snap">snap</span> account, you can probably do the actual programming work of this lab in 25 minutes. (Later labs are more dense, and ask students to reflect on why they're doing what they're doing, but in this first lab the goal is for them to achieve a result that will excite and encourage them, without worrying about details.) </li>
                <li>Students need an email account to create a <span class="snap">snap</span> account.
                    <ul>
                        <li>School email accounts are fine if they accept incoming mail from outside of the school network.</li>
                        <li>If it is possible for you to communicate with students before school starts, ask students to be sure they know their email address and password for the first day.</li>
                        <li>In case students have no email address or can't remember it, one solution is to use a free temporary email service &mdash; do a web search for "temporary email," but be sure your network doesn't block connections to the site you select.</li>
                        <li>Note for middle school teachers: If a student under age 13 creates an account, the dialog box asks for a parent's email rather than the student's own email. This is a legal requirement for <span class="snap">snap</span> to be compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</li>

The article is about professional programmers, not students, but many of its ideas are applicable in the classroom.</li>
                <li>Prepare and copy a "Computer Use Agreement" (<a href="http://csteachingtips.org/tip/have-students-sign-%E2%80%9Ccomputer-use-agreement%E2%80%9D-giving-them-access-machines-hold-them-accountable" target="_blank">see this example</a>) for students to sign to hold them accountable for using computers responsibly.</li>

				<!-- Is this needed with the new Lab 1 pages from the HOC? --Mary
                <li><strong>Saving, Submitting, and Sharing Projects in <span class="snap">snap</span></strong> Find a method for students to submit <span class="snap">snap</span> projects that makes sense to you. Here's one suggestion: In <span class="snap">snap</span>, students can choose "Export project..." from the file menu. This brings up text in XML. Students can right-click on the page and "Save As..." to a local folder. Give students directions on naming their files (e.g. Kaleidoscope-first-last.xml), then have them send this file to you. When you go to display their work, you can open <span class="snap">snap</span>, then choose "Import..." and the file.</li>-->
                <li> 
                	Be sure students understand that are expected to read all the material presented and complete all the "For You To Do" problems with only the following exceptions:
                	<ul>
                    	<li>Yellow boxes are optional reading.</li>
                     	<li>"If There Is Time..." and "Take It Further" problems are <em>not required</em>. (These are provided for students to work on after finishing the required reading and problems. "If There Is Time..." problems are generally about as difficult as "For You To Do" problems, but "Take It Further" problems are often harder. If pairs have finished their assigned work, they can go ahead and start on some of these extra problems and don't have to wait for permission.)</li>
                   </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>
					<strong>Page 1: Getting Started with Snap<em>!</em></strong>
					<ul>
						<li>A few students will have unpredictable problems creating  <span class="snap">snap</span> accounts.  To avoid letting these problems eat up the entire  period, take advantage of pair programming; it's okay if one member of a pair doesn't have an account yet.  You can work with the non-account students after class to get over that hurdle.  (Even better, if you can wrangle a teaching assistant or two from last year's students, this would be a great thing for them to handle during the first class.)</li>

                            The actual pair programming swap that comes partway through the project should be quick, but you'll have to devote a few minutes to discussing how pairs are supposed to work; specifically, the partner whose hands aren't on the keyboard should be actively contributing. Successful pairs are constantly talking.

In the spirit of this first lab, it's not so important that students  understand the Snap<em>!</em> coordinate axes now, and if they don't, just have them follow the instructions literally: a random number between -190 and 190 for <var>x</var>, a random number between -130 and 130 for <var>y</var>. <!--The use of coordinate axes, like everything in this first lab, will be revisited later.--> For your reference, here is the underlying 'anatomy' of the Snap<em>!</em> stage; this background image is available in Snap<em>!</em> by clicking the Stage icon and selecting "Backgrounds" from the File menu.<br /><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/snap-coord-grid.png" alt="Coordinate Grid" title="Coordinate Grid" /></li>
