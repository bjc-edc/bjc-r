        <h2>Programming Lab 4: Building and Debugging Your Own Blocks</h2>
        <p>Students learn to create custom blocks and blocks with inputs and to use custom blocks within custom blocks. Using blocks within blocks continues to presage recursion (calling a procedure from within itself), which will be addressed in <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/5-recursion-trees-fractals.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html" target="_blank">Unit 5: Recursion</a> and <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/6-recursive-reporters.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html" target="_blank">Unit 6: Recursive Reporters</a>. In this lab, students continue to develop comfort with block programming and the <span class="snap">snap</span> interface as they create their own blocks and identify categories and input variables for their new blocks.</p>
        <p>Students also build on their skill with debugging, and they consider how a block that works well on its own might cause problems when used within another block if it is assumed that the inner block preserves the state of the sprite but it actually does not. Whenever a program is not exhibiting the expected behavior, it's a good idea to consider that the bug may not be in a sub procedure of the script but in the way that sub procedures combine and relate to each other when embedded.</p>

				<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/drawing/flower-with-6-square-petals.png" alt="flower with 6 square petals" title="flower with 6 square petals" />
                <li>On the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/4-building-and-debugging/4-building-blocks-within-blocks.html" target="_blank">Using Blocks within Blocks</a> student lab page, students are given only a general instruction to draw a field of flowers. Encourage students to get creative! If students need help focusing  their ideas, suggest they build up their project one step at a time: first building the <code>draw square</code> block, then the <code>draw flower</code> block (perhaps without inputs at first and adding inputs for number and size of petals depending on available time), and lastly creating a script that moves the sprite randomly around the stage and calls the <code>draw flower</code> block. Students might expand this project by changing the size or color of the pen from flower to flower or by changing the polygons used in the flowers from squares to triangles, etc.</li>
