        <h2>Lab 1: Click Alonzo Game</h2>
        <img class="imageRight noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alonzo-flip.gif" alt="Alonzo sprite turning left and right" title="Alonzo sprite turning left and right" />
        <p>Students dive right into programming, in the very first class, by building a game that they can play and share with others. The object of the game is to click on Alonzo (the character at right) as he moves increasingly quickly around the screen. Optionally, they can put the game on their smartphone, which is great for motivation.</p>
        <p>This first lab is designed to hook students' interest in programming. Students will explore many of the ideas introduced here more formally later. Here, students explore the Snap<em>!</em> interface and learn to respond to user interaction (in this case, a click).</p>
        <p>Spend the entire first day with the students programming, without an introductory lecture. Since the goal is for all students to experience the immediate excitement of building a functioning game, postpone introductory classroom management tasks (e.g., establishing classroom routines) until <em>after</em> Lab 1.  Do, however, make sure students understand that if they need help with something, or they're not sure they understand something, it's always okay to talk with their neighbors. Only after they have a successful programming experience behind them, introduce any additional educational technology (Google classroom, Piazza, etc.) that you'd like students to use.</p>
        <div class="todo">Brian, I pulled the following up from Page 2 tips and adapted it. --MF, 5/26/20</div>
        <p>Students will learn about pair programming in Lab 2. For now, you might suggest that if they pair up, one partner can have the lab page on-screen while the other has Snap<em>!</em> open, or you might <em>want</em> students to work individually on the first day, to ensure that they all know how to manipulate the Snap<em>!</em> environment.</p>

        <h3>Prepare</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>If you haven't already, <strong>create your own Snap<em>!</em> account</strong> and <a href="http://teachers.bjc.berkeley.edu/" title="sign up for access to BJC solutions and assessments" target="_blank">sign up for access to BJC solutions and assessments</a>.  Instructions for creating an account are on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/1-creating-a-snap-account.html" title="Getting Started with Snap!">this student page</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Do this lab yourself before class.</strong> Once you've set up your <span class="snap">snap</span> account, you can probably do the actual programming work of this lab in 25 minutes or less. (Later labs are more dense and ask students to reflect on why they're doing what they're doing, but in this first lab, the goal is for them to achieve a result that will excite and encourage them, without worrying about details.) </li>
                <li>Plan for students' Snap<em>!</em> use:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students need an email account to create a <span class="snap">snap</span> account. School email accounts are fine if they accept incoming mail from outside of the school network. If it is possible for you to communicate with students before school starts, ask students to be sure they know their email address and password for the first day. Better yet, suggest that they create Snap<em>!</em> accounts before the first class. You can direct them to the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/1-creating-a-snap-account.html" title="Getting Started with Snap!">first lab page</a>, which explains how.</li>
                        <li>Note that if a student under age 13 creates an account, the dialog box asks for a parent's email rather than the student's own email. This is a legal requirement for <span class="snap">snap</span> to be compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</li>
                        <li>Some school districts will not allow your students to use Snap<em>!</em> accounts for coursework. If you are in one of your districts you can still use Snap<em>!</em>. Accounts aren't required to use Snap<em>!</em>, but they are extremely helpful. Without an account, students will need to "export" each of their projects every day, store the files themselves, and import them again when they want to continue their work. With an account, their projects are stored in the Snap<em>!</em> cloud and they can save and access them through the Snap<em>!</em> File menu.</li>

                                <li>A few students will have unpredictable problems creating <span class="snap">snap</span> accounts.  To avoid letting these problems eat up the entire  period, take advantage of pair programming; it's okay if one member of a pair doesn't have an account yet.  You can work with the non-account students after class to get over that hurdle.  (Even better, if you can wrangle a teaching assistant or two from last year's students, this would be a great thing for them to handle during the first class.)</li>

                                    Oh, I disagree. Like it or not that sets the stage (both for teachers and for students) for this to continue as the classroom norm. Teachers will naturally do this anyway. No need to say it. I want to cut this too. --MF, 5/26/20
                                    <li>This page, like the rest of the course, is meant for students to read and do on their own. But on the first day of the class, too much of the difficulty is about the mechanics of the user interface, rather than about the CS ideas.   So, <em>for this page only,</em> if things seem to be going too slowly, consider having the class follow along with you as you demonstrate what to do, step by step, at the projector.</li>

                                    Don't worry if the block changes color from <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs" /> to <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pale-wait.png" alt="pale-colored wait 1 secs" title="pale-colored wait 1 secs" />
                                    when you insert it in your script. Snap<em>!</em> alternates dark and light colors when you nest same-palette blocks inside each other. This "zebra coloring" is especially useful with arithmetic expressions.<br />

                                <li> A script doesn't <em>have to</em> have a hat block; you can run any script by clicking on it. Scripts without hat blocks are convenient when tinkering with a project. For example, you can make utility scripts just for the programmer and not for the end user of the project (e.g., put the sprite in the middle of the stage and clear the pen traces, which can be a helpful script for debugging).</li>
                                <li> 
                                    After Exercise 7, students should have built the following script. Even if you consider the first <code>go to</code> block redundant, don't tell students to remove it. Later in the project, additional code will make it important to keep the two separate.<br />
                                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/random-twice.png" alt="when I am clicked, {go to random position; forever (go to random position)}" title="when I am clicked, {go to random position; forever (go to random position)}"/><br />

                                  In the starter file, the Alonzo sprite's "draggable" checkbox (just under its name, above the scripting area) is unchecked. This isn't the default, so if your students want to build a similar project on their own, tell them to uncheck it. This is important when a project uses "when I am clicked," because it's easy to move your hand on the mouse slightly while pushing the button, and the computer might treat that as a short dragging rather than a clicking. Unchecking "draggable" rules out dragging.

								<li>This lab uses the ghost effect to "keep score" in order to avoid introducing global variables. In Unit 2 after learning about local variables first, students will use a global variable to keep score formally. This is to help students avoid learning the bad habit of using global variables where local variables suffice.</li>
								<li>Recall that the goal is for students to get to the end of this lab in one day (or two at most), with every student successful in creating a sharable game. Resist the temptation to teach things (e.g., visible stepping to aid debugging) on this first day. All of these ideas will be formalized in future labs and units.</li>
								<li>This page deliberately introduces an <code>if</code> statement, without explanation. If students are confused by this, encourage them to keep going, play the game, and see if it starts making sense to them. Assure them that everything in this lab will be taught "formally" a little later.</li>
