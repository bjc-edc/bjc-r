        <h2>Lab 1: Click Alonzo Game</h2>
        <img class="imageRight noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alonzo-flip.gif" alt="Alonzo sprite turning left and right" title="Alonzo sprite turning left and right" />
        <p>Students set up their <span class="snap">snap</span> accounts so that they can save their projects and then dive right into programming, in the very first class, by building a game that they can then play on their smart phone and share with others. The object of the game is to click on Alonzo (the character at right) as he moves increasingly quickly around the screen.</p>
        <p>This first lab is designed to hook students' interest in programming. Students will explore many of the ideas introduced here more formally later in this and other units. Students explore the <span class="snap">snap</span> interface and build a simple game app that they can run on their phones. In doing so, they learn to respond to user interaction (in this case, a click) and to use multiple cooperating scripts.</p>
		
        <h3>Pacing</h3>

        	The 4 required lab pages could be split across 2-3 days (<strong>55-110 minutes</strong>). Expected times to complete follow:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    10-20 minutes (&lt;1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/1-creating-a-snap-account.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Getting Started with Snap!">Getting Started with Snap<em>!</em></a>

                    </ul>
                </li>

        <h3>Prepare</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Create your own <span class="snap">snap</span> account.</strong>  Instructions are on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/1-creating-a-snap-account.html" title="Getting Started with Snap!">this student page</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>We definitely recommend doing this lab yourself before class.</strong> Once you've set up your <span class="snap">snap</span> account, you can probably do the actual programming work of this lab in 25 minutes. (Later labs are more dense, and ask students to reflect on why they're doing what they're doing, but in this first lab the goal is for them to achieve a result that will excite and encourage them, without worrying about details.) </li>
                <li>Students need an email account to create a <span class="snap">snap</span> account.
                    <ul>
                        <li>School email accounts are fine if they accept incoming mail from outside of the school network.</li>
                        <li>If it is possible for you to communicate with students before school starts, ask students to be sure they know their email address and password for the first day.</li>
                        <li>Better yet, suggest that they create Snap<em>!</em> accounts before the first class. You can point them at the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/1-creating-a-snap-account.html" title="Getting Started with Snap!">lab page</a> that explains how.</li>
                        <li>In case students have no email address or can't remember it, one solution is to use a free temporary email service &mdash; do a web search for "temporary email," but be sure your network doesn't block connections to the site you select.</li>
                        <li>Note for middle school teachers: If a student under age 13 creates an account, the dialog box asks for a parent's email rather than the student's own email. This is a legal requirement for <span class="snap">snap</span> to be compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</li>

        <div>
        	<ul>
                <li>So that students get the immediate excitement of building their own app, postpone introductory classroom management tasks (e.g., establishing classroom routines) until <em>after</em> Lab 1. Spend the entire first day programming. The goal is for them to finish the game on the first day.</li>
                <li>Only after they have a successful programming experience behind them, introduce any additional educational technology (Google classroom, Piazza, etc.) that you'd like students to use.</li>

(These are provided for students to work on after finishing the required reading and problems. "If There Is Time..." problems are generally about as difficult as "For You To Do" problems, but "Take It Further" problems are often harder. If pairs have finished their assigned work, they can go ahead and start on some of these extra problems and don't have to wait for permission.)

                            <ul>
                                <li>A few students will have unpredictable problems creating <span class="snap">snap</span> accounts.  To avoid letting these problems eat up the entire  period, take advantage of pair programming; it's okay if one member of a pair doesn't have an account yet.  You can work with the non-account students after class to get over that hurdle.  (Even better, if you can wrangle a teaching assistant or two from last year's students, this would be a great thing for them to handle during the first class.)</li>
                                <li>
                                    <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png" alt="Pair Programming Swap" title="Pair Programming Swap" /> 
                                    The actual pair programming swap that comes partway through the project should be quick, but you'll have to devote a few minutes to discussing how pairs are supposed to work; specifically, the partner whose hands aren't on the keyboard should be actively contributing. Successful pairs are constantly talking.

                            	<li>Some students may resist pair programming, arguing that they work better alone. Tell them to give pair programming an honest try during the first lab or two, and <em>then</em> you'll entertain ideas about modifying the way the pair works if they still want that.</li>
                                <li>When kids aren't cooperating and both have Snap<em>!</em> open, just go up to them and say: "so, who's the driver and who is the navigator?" and stay over their shoulder until one opens up the lab and yields.</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>The reason we use the ghost effect to &quot;keep score&quot; is that we are trying to avoid introducing variables in this lab. The reason for <em>that</em> is to be able to start with local variables: procedure inputs and <code>for</code> block index variables. In Unit 2, students will use a variable to keep score formally.</li>
								<li>There are many opportunities here to teach things, e.g., visible stepping to aid debugging. Resist the temptation! Your goal is to get to the end of this lab as quickly as possible, with every student successful. Visible stepping is taught in Lab 3 of this unit.</li>

                                <li> A script doesn't <em>have to</em> have a hat block; you can run any script by clicking on it. Scripts without hat blocks are convenient when tinkering with a project. For example, you can make utility scripts just for the programmer, not for the end user of the project (e.g., put the sprite in the middle of the stage and clear the pen traces).</li>
                                <li>When using the <code>say</code> block, some students may expect the sprite to make a sound; instead this block makes the sprite display a speech cloud containing the message, as in a cartoon.</li>
