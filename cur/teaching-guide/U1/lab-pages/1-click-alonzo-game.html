        <h2>Lab 1: Click Alonzo Game</h2>
        <div class="todo">Brian, I edited out all the stuff about smartphones as that's now in an ITIT. --MF, 5/24/20</div>
        <img class="imageRight noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alonzo-flip.gif" alt="Alonzo sprite turning left and right" title="Alonzo sprite turning left and right" />
        <p>Students dive right into programming, in the very first class, by building a game that they can play and share with others. The object of the game is to click on Alonzo (the character at right) as he moves increasingly quickly around the screen.</p>
        <p>This first lab is designed to hook students' interest in programming. Students will explore many of the ideas introduced here more formally later. Here, students explore the Snap<em>!</em> interface and learn to respond to user interaction (in this case, a click) and to use multiple cooperating scripts.</p>
        <div class="todo">Is that true? There is a comment about this in the unit (<a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/lab-pages/1-click-alonzo-game.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-teaching-guide.topic&course=bjc4nyc_teacher.html&novideo&noassignment">1.1.5.2</a> references your comment near the top of <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/1-variables-games/4-keeping-score.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">2.1.4</a>). Is it fair to say "multiple cooperating scripts"? --MF, 5/24/20</div>		
        <div class="todo">I moved the following up from "as a class" as it's more appropriate here. I also cut some of the "don't lecture" lecture, though I kept the spirit of it in the following. Argue with me if you must, but please don't put it back in unless we do it together. --MF, 5/24/20</div>
        <p>Since the goal is for all students to experience the immediate excitement of building a functioning game, postpone introductory classroom management tasks (e.g., establishing classroom routines) until <em>after</em> Lab 1. Spend the entire first day programming. Do, however, make sure students understand that if they need help with something, or they're not sure they understand something, it's always okay to talk with their neighbors.</p>
        <p>Only after they have a successful programming experience behind them, introduce any additional educational technology (Google classroom, Piazza, etc.) that you'd like students to use.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <div class="todo">Let's talk about the pacing below. It seems very extreme compared to what was here before. Am I in an overly optomistic mood or something? Also, is the last page actually optional? It has a standard now and it's the final "check" for the project. --MF, 5/24/20</div>

                <div class="todo">I'd like to cut the parenthetical in the following paragraph. OK? --MF, 5/24/20</div>
                <li><strong>Do this lab yourself before class.</strong> Once you've set up your <span class="snap">snap</span> account, you can probably do the actual programming work of this lab in 25 minutes or less. (Later labs are more dense and ask students to reflect on why they're doing what they're doing, but in this first lab, the goal is for them to achieve a result that will excite and encourage them, without worrying about details.) </li>
                <div class="todo">The following section has been restructured a bit. --MF, 5/24/20</div>
                <li>Plan for students' Snap<em>!</em> use:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accounts aren't required to use Snap<em>!</em>, but the are extremely helpful. Without an account, students will need to "export" each of their projects every day, store the files themselves, and import them again when they want to continue their work. With an account, their projects are stored in the Snap<em>!</em> cloud and they can save and access them through the Snap<em>!</em> File menu.</li>
                        <li>Students need an email account to create a <span class="snap">snap</span> account. School email accounts are fine if they accept incoming mail from outside of the school network. If it is possible for you to communicate with students before school starts, ask students to be sure they know their email address and password for the first day.Better yet, suggest that they create Snap<em>!</em> accounts before the first class. You can direct them to the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/1-creating-a-snap-account.html" title="Getting Started with Snap!">first lab page</a>, which explains how.</li>
                        <div class="todo">I cut this becuase I think it's not a great option.<li>In case students have no email address or can't remember it, one solution is to use a free temporary email service &mdash; do a web search for "temporary email," but be sure your network doesn't block connections to the site you select.</li></div>
                        <li>Note that if a student under age 13 creates an account, the dialog box asks for a parent's email rather than the student's own email. This is a legal requirement for <span class="snap">snap</span> to be compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</li>

                                <li>A few students will have unpredictable problems creating <span class="snap">snap</span> accounts.  To avoid letting these problems eat up the entire  period, take advantage of pair programming; it's okay if one member of a pair doesn't have an account yet.  You can work with the non-account students after class to get over that hurdle.  (Even better, if you can wrangle a teaching assistant or two from last year's students, this would be a great thing for them to handle during the first class.)</li>

                            <ul>
								<li>This lab is <strong><em>not</em></strong> the place to talk about or enforce pair programming.  Suggest that if they pair up, one partner can have the lab page onscreen while the other has Snap<i>!</i> onscreen, but don't make a fuss about it.  That comes in Lab 2.  For now, the goal is to get through the entire lab on the first day.
								  <ul>
								    <li>In fact, you might <em>want</em> students to work individually on the first day, to ensure that they all know how to manipulate the Snap<em>!</em> environment.</li>
							      </ul>
								</li>
								<li>Each chunk of work starts with a sentence or two explaining <em>why</em> they're doing that chunk, e.g., &quot;You're going to program a game in which the goal is to click on Alonzo as he's moving around.&quot;</li>
								<li>This page, like the rest of the course, is meant for students to read and do on their own. But on the first day of the class, too much of the difficulty is about the mechanics of the user interface, rather than about the CS ideas.   So, <em>for this page only,</em> if things seem to be going too slowly, consider having the class follow along with you as you demonstrate what to do, step by step, at the projector.</li>
                                <div class="endnote">
                                    Don't worry if the block changes color from <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs" /> to <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pale-wait.png" alt="pale-colored wait 1 secs" title="pale-colored wait 1 secs" />
                                    when you insert it in your script. Snap<em>!</em> alternates dark and light colors when you nest same-palette blocks inside each other.<br />

                              <li> After For You To Do 6, we expect that the student will have built this script:<br />
                   <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/random-twice.png" alt="when I am clicked, {go to random position; forever (go to random position)}" title="when I am clicked, {go to random position; forever (go to random position)}"/><br />
                   Even if you consider the first <code>go to</code> block redundant,  <em>don't tell students to remove it!</em>  Later in the project, additional code will make it important to keep the two separate.
                   </li>
                              <li>In the starter file, the Alonzo sprite's &quot;draggable&quot; checkbox (just under its name, above the scripting area) is unchecked. This isn't the default, so if your students want to build a similar project on their own, tell them to uncheck it. This is important when a project uses &quot;when I am clicked,&quot; because it's easy to move your hand on the mouse slightly while pushing the button, and the computer might treat that as a short dragging rather than a clicking. Unchecking &quot;draggable&quot; rules out dragging.</li>

                        <li><strong>Learning Goal:</strong> Share programs by email and to mobile devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tips:</strong>
						<ul>
						    <li>Make sure both partners end up with a copy of the project in their accounts.</li>
							<li>Students should <em>share</em> their projects, but not <em>publish</em> them.  Sharing lets them give the project URL to friends, but publishing also displays the project on the Snap<i>!</i> web site.  It's not a big problem if they do that, but it means that 1000 copies of the same assignment crowd out other projects.</li>
							<li>Page 2 created the minimum playable game, and page 3 is saving and sharing it. Bear in mind, and tell students, that when they improve the game on page 4, those improvements will automatically be sent to their friends and their phone as soon as they save to the cloud. That's why we interrupt the programming (pages 2, 4, and 5) with this sharing page; we are trying to make <em>sure</em> they have something to show their friends and their parents <em>the first day of class!</em> You may finish page 4 also on the first day, if your kids are efficient and you remember not to lecture, but if not, they <em>still</em> have something to show today, and something even better after the second class meeting.
							  <ul>
							    <li>Why are your friends' copies updated automatically when you improve the project, but your partner's copy isn't? This may feel strange to students. The answer is that your friends don't really have a <em>copy</em> at all; what they have is a <em>link</em> that allows them to read your own copy. A link is all they need, because they're just playing the game, not programming it. But your partner needs a copy because they need to be able to edit it without you, if you miss a class. Your two copies are two separate projects, as far as Snap<em>!</em> is concerned. This is something you (the teacher) can say to a student who asks, but don't make links vs. copies an issue for the class. Some other week, maybe, but for now, don't let anything slow down the class.</li>

							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>The reason we use the ghost effect to &quot;keep score&quot; is that we are trying to avoid introducing variables in this lab. The reason for <em>that</em> is to be able to start with local variables: procedure inputs and <code>for</code> block index variables. In Unit 2, students will use a variable to keep score formally.</li>
								<li>There are many opportunities here to teach things, e.g., visible stepping to aid debugging. <strong>Resist the temptation!</strong> Your goal is to get to the end of this lab as quickly as possible, with every student successful. Visible stepping is taught in Lab 3 of this unit.</li>
								<li>This page introduces an IF statement, <em>with no explanation.</em> That's deliberate. Some students will just do as they're told and not worry about what it means; some will think about it for a moment and find it perfectly clear; some may find it confusing. Encourage those latter students to keep going, play the game, and see if it starts making sense to them.  Assure them that everything in this lab will be taught &quot;properly&quot; a little later.</li>

                        <li><strong>Learning Goal:</strong> Understand hat blocks and the beginning of multi-threading (more than one script can run at a time).</li>
                        <li><strong>Tips:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li> A script doesn't <em>have to</em> have a hat block; you can run any script by clicking on it. Scripts without hat blocks are convenient when tinkering with a project. For example, you can make utility scripts just for the programmer, not for the end user of the project (e.g., put the sprite in the middle of the stage and clear the pen traces).</li>
                                <li>When using the <code>say</code> block, some students may expect the sprite to make a sound; instead this block makes the sprite display a speech cloud containing the message, as in a cartoon.</li>
