        <h2>Lab 1: Click Alonzo Game</h2>
        <img class="imageRight noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alonzo-flip.gif" alt="Alonzo sprite turning left and right" title="Alonzo sprite turning left and right" />
        <p>Students  dive right into programming, in the very first class, by building a game that they can then play on their smart phone and share with others. The object of the game is to click on Alonzo (the character at right) as he moves increasingly quickly around the screen.</p>
        <p>This first lab is designed to hook students' interest in programming. Students will explore many of the ideas introduced here more formally later in this and other units. Students explore the <span class="snap">snap</span> interface and build a simple game app that they can run on their phones. In doing so, they learn to respond to user interaction (in this case, a click) and to use multiple cooperating scripts.</p>
        <p>Since the goal is for all students to leave class on the first day with a game program running on their phones, it's even more important than usual that you resist the temptation to lecture.</p>
		
        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The three required lab pages (2–4) should be completed in one or two days (<strong>45–90 minutes</strong>). Expected times to complete follow:
    <ul>
                <li>
                    zero minutes  on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/1-creating-a-snap-account.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Getting Started with Snap!">Getting Started with Snap<em>!</em></a>

        <h3>Prepare</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Create your own <span class="snap">Snap<em>!</em></span> account.</strong>  Instructions are on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/1-creating-a-snap-account.html" title="Getting Started with Snap!">this student page</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Create accounts for all your students.</strong> Instructions TBA.</li>
                <li><strong>We definitely recommend doing this lab yourself before class.</strong> Once you've set up your <span class="snap">snap</span> account, you can probably do the actual programming work of this lab in 25 minutes. (Later labs are more dense, and ask students to reflect on why they're doing what they're doing, but in this first lab the goal is for them to achieve a result that will excite and encourage them, without worrying about details.) </li>
  <!--              <li>Students need an email account to create a <span class="snap">snap</span> account.
                    <ul>
                        <li>School email accounts are fine if they accept incoming mail from outside of the school network.</li>
                        <li>If it is possible for you to communicate with students before school starts, ask students to be sure they know their email address and password for the first day.</li>
                        <li>Better yet, suggest that they create Snap<em>!</em> accounts before the first class. You can point them at the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/1-creating-a-snap-account.html" title="Getting Started with Snap!">lab page</a> that explains how.</li>
                        <li>In case students have no email address or can't remember it, one solution is to use a free temporary email service &mdash; do a web search for "temporary email," but be sure your network doesn't block connections to the site you select.</li>
                        <li>Note for middle school teachers: If a student under age 13 creates an account, the dialog box asks for a parent's email rather than the student's own email. This is a legal requirement for <span class="snap">snap</span> to be compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</li>

        <h3>As a Class</h3>
        <div>
        	<ul>
                <li>So that students get the immediate excitement of building their own app, postpone introductory classroom management tasks (e.g., establishing classroom routines) until <em>after</em> Lab 1. Spend the entire first day programming. The goal is for them to install the game on their phones on the first day.
					<ul>
						<li>Exception:  Make sure students understand that if they need help with something, or they're not sure they understand something, it's always okay to talk with their neighbors.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
                <li>Only after they have a successful programming experience behind them, introduce any additional educational technology (Google classroom, Piazza, etc.) that you'd like students to use.</li>

                                <li>A few students will have unpredictable problems creating <span class="snap">snap</span> accounts.  To avoid letting these problems eat up the entire  period, take advantage of pair programming; it's okay if one member of a pair doesn't have an account yet.  You can work with the non-account students after class to get over that hurdle.  (Even better, if you can wrangle a teaching assistant or two from last year's students, this would be a great thing for them to handle during the first class.)</li>

                            <strong>Tips:</strong>
                            <ul>
								<li>This lab is <strong><em>not</em></strong> the place to talk about or enforce pair programming.  Suggest that if they pair up, one partner can have the lab page onscreen while the other has Snap<i>!</i> onscreen, but don't make a fuss about it.  That comes in Lab 2.  For now, the goal is to get through the lab on the first day.</li>
								<li>Each chunk of work starts with a sentence or two explaining <em>why</em> they're doing that chunk, e.g., &quot;You're going to program a game in which the goal is to click on Alonzo as he's moving around.&quot;</li>
								<li>This page, like the rest of the course, is meant for students to read and do on their own. But on the first day of the class, too much of the difficulty is about the mechanics of the user interface, rather than about the CS ideas.   So, <em>for this page only,</em> if things seem to be going too slowly, consider having the class follow along with you as you demonstrate what to do, step by step, at the projector.</li>
                                <div class="endnote">
                                    Don't worry if the block changes color from <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs" /> to <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pale-wait.png" alt="pale-colored wait 1 secs" title="pale-colored wait 1 secs" />
                                    when you insert it in your script. Snap<em>!</em> alternates dark and light colors when you nest same-palette blocks inside each other.<br />

    }
}" title="when I am (clicked):

    forever 
    {
        go to (random position)
        wait (2) secs
    }
}">
                                </div>
                                <li> After For You To Do 6, we expect that the student will have built this script:<br />
                   <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/random-twice.png" alt="when I am clicked, {go to random position; forever (go to random position)}" title="when I am clicked, {go to random position; forever (go to random position)}"/> <br />
                   You may consider the first <code>go to</code> block redundant, but <em>don't tell students to remove it!</em>  Later in the project, additional code will make it important to keep them separate.

                        <li><strong>Learning Goal:</strong> Share programs by email and to mobile devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tips:</strong>
						<ul>
						    <li>Make sure both partners end up with a copy of the project in their accounts.</li>
							<li>Students should <em>share</em> their projects, but not <em>publish</em> them.  Sharing lets them give the project URL to friends, but publishing also displays the project on the Snap<i>!</i> web site.  It's not a big problem if they do that, but it means that 1000 copies of the same assignment crowd out other projects.</li>
							<li>Page 2 created the minimum playable game, and page 3 is saving and sharing it. Bear in mind, and tell students, that when they improve the game on page 4, those improvements will automatically be sent to their friends and their phone as soon as they save to the cloud. That's why we interrupt the programming (pages 2, 4, and 5) with this sharing page; we are trying to make <em>sure</em> they have something to show their friends and their parents <em>the first day of class!</em> You may finish page 4 also on the first day, if your kids are efficient and you remember not to lecture, but if not, they <em>still</em> have something to show today, and something even better after the second class meeting.</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>The reason we use the ghost effect to &quot;keep score&quot; is that we are trying to avoid introducing variables in this lab. The reason for <em>that</em> is to be able to start with local variables: procedure inputs and <code>for</code> block index variables. In Unit 2, students will use a variable to keep score formally.</li>
								<li>There are many opportunities here to teach things, e.g., visible stepping to aid debugging. <strong>Resist the temptation!</strong> Your goal is to get to the end of this lab as quickly as possible, with every student successful. Visible stepping is taught in Lab 3 of this unit.</li>
								<li>This page introduces an IF statement, <em>with no explanation.</em> That's deliberate. Some students will just do as they're told and not worry about what it means; some will think about it for a moment and find it perfectly clear; some may find it confusing. Encourage those latter students to keep going, play the game, and see if it starts making sense to them.  Assure them that everything in this lab will be taught &quot;properly&quot; a little later.</li>

                        <li><strong>Learning Goal:</strong> Understand hat blocks and the beginning of multi-threading (more than one script can run at a time).</li>
                        <li><strong>Tips:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li> A script doesn't <em>have to</em> have a hat block; you can run any script by clicking on it. Scripts without hat blocks are convenient when tinkering with a project. For example, you can make utility scripts just for the programmer, not for the end user of the project (e.g., put the sprite in the middle of the stage and clear the pen traces).</li>
                                <li>When using the <code>say</code> block, some students may expect the sprite to make a sound; instead this block makes the sprite display a speech cloud containing the message, as in a cartoon.</li>
