        <h2>Lab 5: Follow the Leader</h2>
        <p>Students create scripts in which a sprite follows the mouse around the stage and its position is sensed and followed by a second sprite.  They also continue to build experience with control structures for which conditions can be set (e.g., loops and conditionals) without yet formalizing. Resist the urge to "teach" these concepts at the outset; instead, allow students to learn how these work <em>in context</em>, applying them to their programs. Students will get lots of experience with loops and conditionals and will codify this learning later.</p>
		

		<h3>Pacing</h3>
		<div>
			The 2 lab pages could be split across 2 days (55-90 minutes). Expected times to complete follow:
			<ul>
				<li>20-40 minutes (&lt;1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/5-follow-the-leader/1-following-sprites.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Sprite Following the Mouse</a></li>
				<li>35-50 minutes (about 1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/5-follow-the-leader/2-sprite-interaction.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Sprite Following a Sprite</a></li>

                            <li>Be comfortable creating multiple sprites and giving them behaviors.</li>
                            <li>Understand how to make a sprite follow the motion of the mouse.</li>
                            <li>Learn how to have a sprite "sense" the location of another sprite and change its behavior accordingly.</li>
                            <li>Build some experience with control blocks such as the <code>forever</code> block.</li>
                            </ul>
							
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Tip:</strong> There is a subtle difference between the green flag and the stop button. These two buttons are not exact opposites; don't think "green starts the project and red stops it." The stop button <em>forcibly</em> stops all currently running scripts. The green flag doesn't forcibly start all scripts; it merely provides a signal that students <em>can</em> use, if they want, as a starting condition for a script. Some projects ignore the green flag entirely, and start in some other way, e.g., by clicking a button-shaped sprite on the stage. You don't have to explain all this to students, but a student might ask why clicking the flag doesn't start all scripts. (Another related possibly confusing point is that the stop button doesn't prevent scripts from starting after it's clicked. Scripts can start in response to clicking a sprite, hitting a keyboard letter, and so on.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Mathematics Note.</strong> Experimenting with the <var>mouse x</var> and <var>mouse y</var> sensors can help students get used to the underlying coordinate grid.</li>

                                <li>Use the <code>repeat until</code> block to avoid the possibility of an unintended infinite loop.</li>
                                <li>Use the <code>touching?</code> predicate block to sense if one sprite is touching another.</li>
                                <li>Use the <code>think</code> block to make a sprite "think" something. (Much like <code>say</code>, this block makes the sprite display a thought bubble containing the message, as in a cartoon.)</li>
                                <li>Pass messages between sprites with <code>tell</code> block.</li>

                            <li>Understand the distiction between loops that repeat indefinitely and loops that repeat until a condition is met.</li>
                            <li>Gain further experience in sprites "sensing" each other.</li>
                            <li>Learn how to have a sprite <code>tell</code> another sprite what to do.</li>
                            <li>Learn how to use the <code>say</code> and <code>think</code> blocks for creative expression.</li>

                            <li>The students may get frustrated seeing the two sprites permanently stuck on each other and unable to move. You may have to help them realize that before the chase starts, the two sprites must be separated by some distance and a brief pause must be introduced.<br />

                                    This page has a conversation in Haitian Creole, Russian, English, and Spanish.  Make sure students understand that they are to <em>make up their own conversation</em>. The point of this example is to show that students can use whatever language(s) they like in their programs. Watch for students who have become so used to "doing what the book says" that they get stuck trying to copy this text. Encourage them to use their own creativity!
