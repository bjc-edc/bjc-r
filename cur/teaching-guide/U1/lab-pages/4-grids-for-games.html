        <p>Students begin a project—building a Tic Tac Toe game and other games that are played by placing marks (X or O, or a number) on a square array of tiles. This project will develop over the course of a few units. In this lab, students get as far as creating the grid, getting it automatically to fit the screen regardless of the number of tiles, and placing marks on the grid (but not yet with the computer checking to see if the moves are legal or if a player has won). In doing this, students continue to use ideas (and new levels) of abstraction, and learn also how to use a variety of math reporters—four basic operations (<code>+</code>, <code>−</code>, <code>×</code>, <code>÷</code>), and <code>mod</code>&mdash;to create new reporter blocks, <em>functions</em> to perform specialized calculations for them.</p>

        <h3>Technical tips:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>People sometimes wonder about <strong>the use of compass directions rather than Cartesian directions</strong>. Here's some history:
                  <ul>
                    <li>This tradition started in Logo in the 1980s and was inherited by Scratch, then by <span class="snap">snap</span>.</li>
                    <li>In Logo, the turtle had the arrowhead shape that's our default, and  pointed up by default. This is the right thing for fractal trees, and as good as anything for other turtle geometry exercises like the ones in BJC.</li>
                    <li>Scratch shifted the focus from turtle graphics to animation of characters, so sprites have costumes, such as their trademark cat, that move mostly horizontally. So they ended up with Logo's compass directions, but with a default direction of East (90 degrees).</li>
                    <li>The choice of direction measure in Snap<em>!</em> is motivated mostly by the desire to be compatible with Scratch, so that we have access to their 10 million uploaded projects.</li>
                  </ul>
                  For teachers who want to use Snap<em>!</em> in teaching mathematics, it's easy enough to build your own angle blocks:<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/setangle.png" alt="set angle (x)  point in direction 90-x"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/angle.png" alt="angle:  report (90-direction) mod 360"><br />
                You can even convert to/from radians if you prefer.</li>
                <li>Some <strong>vocabulary</strong> (for <em>you</em> to use in context,  not to require of students):
                  <ul>
    <li>A <em>command</em> is a single Lego-brick-shaped block, without its inputs.</li>
                    <li>A <em>reporter</em> is a single oval-shaped block, without its inputs.</li>
                    <li>A <em>predicate</em> is a single hexagonal block, without its inputs.</li>
                    <li>An <em>instruction</em> is a command block along with its input expressions.</li>
                    <li>An <em>expression</em> is a reporter block along with its input expressions.</li>
                    <li>A <em>Boolean expression</em> is a predicate block along with its input expressions.</li>
                    <li>A <em>Boolean value</em> is <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true"> or <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false">. (Not the text strings "true" and "false"; not 0 and 1.)</li>
                  </ul>
                  So a reporter or a predicate is a function; an expression is a function applied to arguments.</li>
            </ul>
