                <li>GH Feedback 10/5/15: Is that right about the ambiguity? The script as it is will draw 8 lines of 'some' length. Most students chose the octagon (so did I!)<br />It is true, however, that a square could be drawn and redrawn if the number of degrees is set to 90, and a hexagon drawn and partially redrawn if the angle is set to 60. Then only one that cant be drawn is the dodecagon, because the colors of the sides are consecutive, rtather tan alternating</li>

        <p>Students use loops to repeat  steps of code. Students consider the implications of nesting <code>repeat</code> blocks within <code>repeat</code> blocks and explore short scripts with <code>forever</code> and <code>for</code> blocks.</p>

Students develop understanding of <strong>abstraction</strong> as they see how projects can be subdivided into smaller tasks and programmed in chunks. This practice lets programmers build more complex programs by hiding details, and makes the code easier to read and debug. </p>

        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <div>
        	<ul>
				<li><strong>Angles</strong>: High school geometry is not prerequisite to BJC, but students who have had it may be able to share their knowledge about working with degrees. On the other hand, <strong>a common misunderstanding about drawing polygons for students who've studied geometry is to confuse the interior angles of the figure with the angles of sprite rotation</strong>. These are not generally the same; they are, in fact, supplementary. To clarify the distinction, have students draw sketches with marked angles. Don't make it a discussion about math vocabulary; focus students' attention on tracing out the sprite's turning. If you're lucky enough to have a classroom with chalk rather than dry erase markers, draw a big equilateral triangle on the floor, and get one or more kids to "play sprite," tracing the picture by moving and turning, and ask them to pay attention to what their bodies are doing.  "Did you turn more or less than a right angle?" If that doesn't clear up the confusion, trace (in chalk) the kid's foot before and after a turn, and get the kid to draw the arc between the two feet.</li>
        		<li>In the first page, the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-control-commands/1-the-repeat-block.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment#structure">analyze structure question</a> has a deliberate ambiguity: Can we run the script more than once? If not, only the square can be drawn, but if we <em>can</em> run that script more than once, it can draw all of the first three pictures. With luck, students will take different sides on that ambiguity and an interesting discussion will ensue. If that doesn't happen spontaneously, you can start the discussion by pointing out the ambiguity yourself. Don't say it was intentional, but feel free to say "Whoever wrote this wasn't clear enough." That leaves room for you, in class to say to students, when it is true, "I'm not sure what you mean. Could you say more?"</li>
