        <p>Students use loops to repeat similar steps of code. Students compare and contrast functionally equivalent scripts (one that uses a loop and one without) to appreciate the clarity, simplicity, and elegance of looping. Students consider the implications of nesting <code>repeat</code> blocks within <code>repeat</code> blocks and explore short scripts with <code>forever</code> and <code>for</code> blocks.</p>
    <p>Nesting <code>repeat</code> blocks within <code>repeat</code> blocks previews <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/4-building-and-debugging/4-building-blocks-within-blocks.html" target="_blank">Using Blocks within Blocks</a> in Lab 4. Students develop understanding of <strong>abstraction</strong> as they see how projects can be broken down into smaller tasks and programmed in chunks. This practice helps the programmer conceptualize the project and makes the code easier to read and debug. Recursion (calling a procedure from within itself) will be addressed in much greater detail in <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/5-recursion-trees-fractals.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html" target="_blank">Unit 5: Recursion</a> and <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/6-recursive-reporters.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html" target="_blank">Unit 6: Recursive Reporters</a>.</p>

        
        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 3 lab pages could be split across two days (50-65 minutes), and may push into the second week of Unit 1. Expected times to complete follow: <ul>
                <li>15-20 minutes on The Real Value of the <code>Repeat</code> Block</li>
                <li>20-25 minutes on Nesting Repeats</li>

        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <div>
        	<ul>
				<li><strong>Angles</strong>: High school geometry is not a requirement of this course, but students who have had it may be at an advantage when drawing polygons. Look to these students to share their knowledge about working with degrees. On the other hand, <strong>a common misunderstanding about drawing polygons for students who've studied geometry is to confuse the interior angles of the figure with the angles of sprite rotation</strong>. These are not generally the same; they are, in fact, supplementary. To clarify the distinction, have students draw sketches with marked angles. Don't make it a discussion about math vocabulary; focus students' attention on tracing out the sprite's turning. If you're lucky enough to have a classroom with chalk rather than dry erase markers, draw a big equilateral triangle on the floor, and get one or more kids to &quot;play sprite,&quot; tracing the picture by moving and turning, and ask them to pay attention to what their bodies are doing.  &quot;Did you turn more or less than a right angle?&quot; If that doesn't clear up the confusion, trace (in chalk) the kid's foot before and after a turn, and get the kid to draw the arc between the two feet.</li>
        		<li>In the first page, the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-control-commands/1-the-repeat-block.html#structure" target="_blank">analyze structure question</a> has a deliberate ambiguity: Is it allowed to run the script more than once? If not, only the square can be drawn, but if so, the first three can be drawn. With luck, students will take different sides on that ambiguity and an interesting discussion will ensue. If that doesn't happen spontaneously, you can point out the ambiguity yourself (without saying it was intentional) to start the discussion.</li>
