		<h2>Lab 2: Sprite Conversation</h2>
        <div class="commentBig">
            <p><strong>What you will do:</strong> In this lab, you will program your computer so that two sprites gossip with each other, picking randomly from words and ideas that you specify. Keep it friendly!</p>
            <p><strong>What you will learn:</strong> You will learn to <em>create your own blocks</em> that you can use just like the blocks that Snap<em>!</em> provides. You will  learn how to <em>create lists of data</em>, <em>select data</em> from those lists, and <em>combine data</em> in new ways. In this project, the data will be words and phrases that you supply.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>In Labs 2 and 3, students learn a new idea: not only can they assemble existing blocks (code) to create sequences (scripts), they can also encapsulate an entire script into a single new block of their own design, which they can then use as if that block had always existed. This process—one aspect of <em>abstraction</em>—is basic to computer science.</p>
        <p>In this Lab 2, students first experiment with some blocks that have been built for them, to see what they do. Then they learn to <em>edit</em> and <em>modify</em> these blocks. Finally they <em>create</em> a new block of their own using the exact same <em>structure</em> they've seen in the blocks they've edited, but with new content. (In lab 3, they will extend this knowledge, learning how to give blocks inputs.)</p>

			</ul>
		</div>


		<div class="commentBig">Teacher note: edit the project, insert your name, three or four students' names, and some famous name the students all know; keep "my cat," and something else silly</div>
		<div class="commentBig">We need to find a way for teachers to <em>modify</em> the file that their students will download.<p>Do we? Is is essential? I say, let the kids do it. --MF, 3/12/17</p></div>

		<h3>Prepare:</h3>
		<div> 
            <ul>
                <li>Before your students begin this lab, load the project yourself, edit <code>who</code>, and personalize it by inserting your name, three or four students' names, and some famous name the students all know. Keep "my cat," and something else silly. Then save the project so that when your students load the project, it has names they recognize.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


		<h3>Goals for the Lab:</h3>
		<div class="sidenoteBig">
			<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>

				<li></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>
        	The context is whimsical—students generally enjoy teaching a computer to gossip and find the results funny—but the ideas they are learning are deep.
            <ul>
                <li>Abstraction: A multi-part script can be "hidden" inside a block so that you don't need to see all its details, and given a name so that you easily know what it does. (Students will learn another aspect of abstraction in lab 3.)</li>
                <li>Creation of a list and (random) selection from a list: Students have used numbers as "data" (information) when they worked on the U1L1-ClickAlonzo project. Lists, and the words and phrases that they put in the lists in this lab, are other kinds of data. Lists are extremely powerful and students will learn a great deal more about them in Units 2 and 3 and beyond.</li>
                <li>Computer-generated language: The gossip example is very elementary, but getting a computer to generate (and understand) natural language has been the serious work of computer scientists for decades. Siri is one of the results.</li>
                <li>Technique: Learning how to test (experiment with), edit, modify, and create new blocks is central to programming.</li>
                <li>Process: Learning to try out code to see what it does, and then analyze code to see how it works is also central to programming.</li>
            </ul>

					<strong>Page 1: Making Programs Talk.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>The XML file that students load (U1L2-GreetPlayer.xml) already has a <var>player list</var> variable that has been initialized as an empty list. In future units, students will need to define and initialize variables themselves, but as this unit is not focused on the use of variables, it has already been done in this project.</li>

		<h3>Tips:</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
            	<li><It is probably too early to talk about abstraction and name it. Students will need to see more examples of it before it <em>needs</em> a piece of technical vocabulary. But two of its attributes may be worth mentioning even now. Putting <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/item-(random)-of-(list-(Señora_my-cat_more)).png" alt="item-(random)-of-(list-(Señora_my-cat_more))"> inside a block named <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/who.png" alt="who"> makes code easier to read and understand by "hiding the complexity" and using a simple name that describes the <em>purpose</em> of the code. Once we understand what <code>who</code> <em>does</em> and are assured that it works properly, we no longer need or want to see the guts of how it works.</li>
