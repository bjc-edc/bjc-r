        <p>In the first part of this lab, students think about the information that is available online about them, discuss why privacy is good to protect, and consider reasons for giving up that privacy. The <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading is about innovations all around us that collect data about us. Students then examine communications technology and discuss ways in which computing affects our ability to build community. Finally, students end by learning about cyberbullying: why people bully, how computing affects the nature and seriousness of bullying, and how social decisions about technology (such as sites devoted to anonymous posting) affect the issue.</p>
		<p>Privacy is a major issue when considering the social implications of computing. Students should learn how they can best protect their online privacy, but must also learn that threats to privacy are a social construct, not a law of nature, and that they <em>shouldn't have to</em> worry so much about privacy. (This is a general point about teaching social implications: Don't make it a "computer ethics" course in which grownups tell kids what to do. Instead, it's more about how technology should be regulated in the interest of users.)</p>
		<p>Discussing cyberbullying also gets students to think about how the Internet can bring out the worst in people. This is a serious discussion about a potentially personal and sensitive topic, and is an opportunity to reinforce your classroom as a safe space to pursue these topics.</p>
    	<p>Different modes of communication is a topic on the AP exam. They will only begin learning about how these technologies work in this Lab. What they learn now will make more sense as they learn more about how the Internet works.</p>
		<p>Students begin to see that computing has social implications. The reading in <em>Blown to Bits</em> highlights ways the world has been changed by computing and identifies examples that might not look at first like a "bits story"" but are. In this lab, students get a range of experiences: reading the book, beginning a list of computing innovations, debating the hot topic of how violent video games might (or might not) relate to youth violence, and finding evidence for ways that technology can be both good and bad.</p>

        
        <h4>A few general points about teaching social implications:</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Good discussions require trust. Students won't start out trusting each other or you (but mainly each other). It's vital that you catch any <em>ad hominem</em> argument or verbal bullying, make everyone stop talking, and quietly but clearly make it clear that you won't allow personal attacks.</li>
                <li>Conventional wisdom says that teachers should not express their own opinions. That's not necessarily right. You generally shouldn't <em>start</em> with your own opinion, or use your position of authority as teacher to imply that it's the "right" one, but if everyone in the class seems to take the opposite position, it's beneficial for you to weigh in, as long as you hold yourself to the same standard of evidence you expect from students, and as long as you convince them that their grade doesn't depend on agreeing with you. (For this reason, you should present your grading policy early, perhaps online.) Certainly you shouldn't pretend not to have opinions. Your total honesty will help build trust.</li>
                <li>Most issues appear at first to have two possible answers, in direct opposition. Usually neither of those initial answers is satisfactory, but neither is labeling the question unanswerable. Look for third positions, not a "compromise" but a genuinely different way of thinking. As one example, the issue of copyright initially presents itself as "information wants to be free" versus "copying is theft," but any useful resolution has to start by noting that the interests of publishing companies (record labels, movie studios, etc.) are very different from the interests of creators (musicians, etc.). Maybe we need a solution that protects musicians, but we don't need a solution that protects record labels. Also, the badly-named "copyright" is not a <em>right</em> the way freedom of speech is a right. It is a <em>limited-time</em> legal monopoly, given to creators as part of a bargain through which their creations eventually enter the public domain. Does all that make illegal downloading okay? That's a hard question, not an obvious one.</li>
                <li>Make sure students understand that the social implications of technology are not all bad! None of us wants to live in a world without antibiotics. But the good social implications generally take care of themselves, whereas the bad ones require social action, redesign of the technology, research, and deep understanding.</li>
                <li>"Everyone has the right to their opinion" is both true and false. It's true in the sense that nobody should be <em>punished</em> for their opinions (in class or in the world). But not all opinions are equally worthy; the persuasive ones are backed up with research and evidence.</li>
                <li>Start with Computing in the News as often as possible. Always bring in two stories, one about a wonderful advance in technology, and one about a social problem related to technology. If possible, after the first few examples, make <em>students</em> responsible for bringing in the two stories. Rotate through all the students if possible. Generally the stories will be presented quickly and not discussed; the opener shouldn't take over the entire class. But if a particular story really resonates with the students, you might ditch the lesson plan in favor of a longer discussion.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Review <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter2.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Blown to Bits</em> Chapter 2</a>. Students are not asked to read the whole chapter.</li>
            	<li>Continue to think about how your classroom space is set up. If it is possible to move away from computers and even arrange chairs in a circle, this will help establish a discussion space.</li>
                <li>Review all lab activities, especially the interesting resources (Prezi and PowerPoint) in Getting Started, and <a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Four-Corners-Narrative.pdf" target="_blank">instructions for the Four Corners activity </a> in Communication and Community.</li>

        	<div class="sidenote">Options for students to access <em>Blown to Bits</em> include reading it as an <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter1.pdf" target="_blank">online PDF</a>, purchasing hard copies of the book, or photocopying pages so students can make annotations as they read.</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Review the <a href="https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=79" target="_blank">CSP Explore task</a> specification. Its requirements are pretty narrow (e.g., students must discuss how a chosen innovation uses data, and must prepare both a paper and a multimedia presentation). We certainly want to prepare students for this requirement, but our aims are broader; we want them to develop the intellectual tools to understand technology and society more deeply.</li>
                <li>Several activities in this lab ask students to make videos. Be sure to know your school's policy on publication of images of students; you may have to warn students not to post their videos on social media, or alternatively to make videos in which they do not appear onscreen.</li>
                <li>If you haven't yet, make sure you use <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-teaching-guide.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016_teacher.html&novideo&noassignment">Computing in the News</a> as an opener this week.</li>
                <li>Think about how you want students to interact with computers and each other this week. Students will need to be on the computer at times to do some online research. You may choose to print out <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">Chapter 1 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a> so that students can annotate as they read. Students will also engage in discussion with each other, so think of a way to arrange your space so students can have eye contact with each other.</li>
                <li>Review all lab activities, especially the debate activities included with Do violent video games contribute to youth violence? (<a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Skill-5-Counterargument-DRMO-One-Pager.docx" target="_blank">making counterarguments</a>) and Is technology good or bad?

                        <li>
                            Here are some possible answers to problem 2:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Government threats to privacy are the easiest to see, especially in the post-Snowden era. It's important for students to understand that these threats aren't new; that's why the Constitution prohibited unwarranted search or seizure over 200 years ago. On the other hand, they should also understand how dramatically government behavior changed after 9/11. Besides the NSA and the police agencies, government threats include the IRS and more obscure data collection. For example, sales of real estate are public records, and often include Social Security numbers. This wasn't so important when you had to visit the county clerk's office to search the records, but now they're online.</li>
                                <li>The corporate threats everyone talks about are Google and Facebook. But the sharing of information among banks and credit bureaus is equally problematic. Internet Service Providers read the data you send or receive over the net. You can use DuckDuckGo for your web searches instead of Google, but it's hard to avoid using either the phone company or the cable company as your ISP (or your ISP's ISP). A loophole in the laws preventing national police data collection allows the police to buy the data from private companies that do the collection for them.</li>
                                <li>Smartphone owners can record video in public places. This has given rise to a culture of shaming. That can be a good thing when police brutality is documented by a passerby, but incidents like the widespread harassment of "<a href="http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/the_tale_of_dog_poop_girl_is_n.php">Dog Poop Girl</a>" are troubling. (Since that first example, there have been several more online posting of videos of other dog poop violators.)</li>

                        </li>

                <li>
					<strong>Page 3: Tanya Rider's Story.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Much of <em>Blown to Bits</em> has to do with the balance between the abundance of digital information and our attempts for retaining privacy and ownership of our own information. After students read the selection, discuss briefly. Students may also be interested in looking up news stories or videos about Tanya Rider.</li>
                        <li>On the other hand, don't let the discussion be entirely about the exciting details of her narrow escape. The reason the authors of <em>Blown to Bits</em> chose this story to start the book is that it makes us think twice about the goal of privacy that otherwise pervades the book and most discussions of social implications. It was the protection of Ms. Rider's privacy that almost cost her life. The Take It Further activity on this page tries to push students toward a nuanced, dialectical understanding of the privacy issue: neither a simplistic embracing of personal privacy nor a complete rejection of privacy as a goal will do.</li>
						<li>In Take It Further problem A, there are many possibilities.  How about if the cell phone company was allowed to tell the Red Cross where the missing person's cell phone is?  Or the Fire Department?  How about if the rule were different for a moving cell phone in a city vs, a stationary cell phone in the middle of nowhere?</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading should be done as a jigsaw. Each student will read their two sections carefully. Then they will share the key points from their sections, teaching the other students in their group.</li>
                        <li>Be aware that "Connecting the Dots" is the longest section to read, and in some ways the hardest, because it's not about a specific innovation, but about the idea that "de-identified" data might not be as secure as one might think.</li>
                        <li>Problem 3 asks students to read information about "How Sites Know Who You Are." Students will learn more about how the Internet works in future Labs. Students are not expected to master the idea of IP addresses now, but are being exposed to the terms.</li>

                        <li>Problem 3 introduces two new topics. The statements "Computers are isolating" and "Computers are democratizing" will likely need to be explained to students. This <a href="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/isolating-democratizing.pptx" target="_blank">PowerPoint about community</a> is a resource for you (you may share it with students if you wish) that gives examples of why/why not computers are isolating and why/why not computers are democratizing. Student discussions will be much better if you present at least some of these examples before they take positions.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>There's only one socially acceptable position on bullying, but clearly not everyone agrees with it, or there wouldn't be any bullies. So this is a discussion in which you'll have to be especially careful to protect students' right to disagree. You're unlikely to hear a blanket defense of bullying, but, for example, some students may feel that retaliatory bullying (bullying the bully) is okay. Others may feel that if the First Amendment protects Nazi and KKK rallies, it should also protect cyberbullying. Bend over backward to make room for these opinions in the discussion.</li>
                        <li>Have students work in small groups for 10-15 minutes researching the issue of cyberbullying online.</li>

                            Students will engage in a 25-30 minute discussion. There are three parts to this discussion:
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>
                                    Share some of the findings from the online research on the question: <em>What are some different forms that cyberbullying can take?</em> Students can share stories they found or different definitions of cyberbullying.

                                <li>Next, discuss: <em>What are some possible ways to effectively address this issue?</em> Students may choose to focus on what they can do individually, what they should think should happen in schools, or what should be done at a societal level.</li>
                                <li>Finally, discuss: <em>What are the challenges to addressing cyberbullying?</em> For example, students may raise First Amendment rights, privacy issues regarding their communication, or the ability to assume other identities or operate anonymously online.</li>

                            Students have likely heard of or even experienced some form of cyberbullying. In <em>Blown to Bits</em>, they will later read a story (page 16) about a student who committed suicide after hurtful comments were aimed at her online. While students generally agree that such tragedies should not occur, they likely differ about their definition of what should be considered cyberbullying. Later, they will engage in a class discussion about possible ways to address cyberbullying. This Snap Judgment is meant to help students clarify for themselves what they mean when they think of "cyberbullying."
