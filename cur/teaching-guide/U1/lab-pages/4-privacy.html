        <h2>Lab 4: Protecting Your Privacy</h2>
		<p> In the first two pages of this lab, students consider the information that is available online about them, discuss why privacy is good to protect, and consider reasons for giving up  privacy. The <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading is about innovations all around us that collect data about us. </p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p>Among the social implications of computing, privacy is a major issue. Students should learn how they can best protect their online privacy, but must also learn that threats to privacy are a social construct, not a law of nature, and that they <em>shouldn't have to</em> worry so much about privacy. (This is a general point about teaching social implications: Don't make it a "computer ethics" course in which grownups tell kids what to do. Instead, it's more about how technology should be regulated in the interest of users.)</p>
            <p>When we first wrote this lab in 2010, only a few &quot;crazies&quot; worried about privacy, and those who did, worried about the government rather than about tech companies. This topic was a hard sell. But in 2019, with Facebook officers testifying to Congress all the time, many more people see the need to protect privacy.</p>
        </div>
		<p>Students begin to see that computing has social implications. The reading in <em>Blown to Bits</em> highlights ways the world has been changed by computing and identifies examples that might not look at first like a "bits story" but are. In this lab, students get a range of experiences: reading the book, beginning a list of computing innovations, and finding evidence for ways that technology can be both good and bad.</p>

            <h4>General Points about Teaching Social Implications</h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Good discussions require trust.</strong> Students won't start out trusting each other or you (but mainly each other). It's vital that you catch any <em>ad hominem</em> argument or verbal bullying, make everyone stop talking, and quietly but clearly make it clear that personal attacks aren't acceptable behavior or valid arguments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't start with your own opinion, but</strong> if everyone in the class seems to take the opposite position, it can be beneficial for you to weigh in. Teachers should not use their position of authority  to imply that their opinion is the "right" one, but your opinions can be valuable as long as you hold yourself to the same standard of evidence you expect from students and as long as you convince them that their grade doesn't depend on agreeing with you. (Present your grading policy clearly and early to help build that trust.)</li>
                    <li>Most issues at first appear to have two opposing answers. <strong>Look for third positions</strong>&mdash;not a "compromise" but a genuinely different way of thinking.</li>
                    <div class="endnote" style="color: black">As one example of the power of a third position, the issue of copyright initially presents itself as "information wants to be free" versus "copying is theft," but any useful resolution has to start by noting that the interests of publishing companies (record labels, movie studios, etc.) are very different from the interests of creators (musicians, etc.). Maybe we need a solution that protects musicians, but we don't need a solution that protects record labels. Also, the badly-named "copyright" is not a <em>right</em> the way freedom of speech is a right. It is a <em>limited-time</em> legal monopoly, given to creators (and transferable to others) as part of a bargain through which their creations eventually enter the public domain. Does all that make illegal downloading okay? That's a hard question, not an obvious one.</div>
                    <li><strong>Everyone has the right to their opinion, but not all opinions are equally worthy.</strong> Nobody should be <em>punished</em> for their opinions (in this class or in the world), but the persuasive perspectives  are backed up with research and evidence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Start with Computing in the News as often as possible.</strong> Always bring in two stories, one about a wonderful advance in technology, and one about a social problem related to technology. If possible, after the first few examples, make <em>students</em> responsible for bringing in the two stories. Rotate through all the students if possible. Generally the stories will be presented quickly and <em>not discussed</em>; the opener generally shouldn't take over the class period, but if a particular story resonates with the students, you might allow a longer discussion.</li>
                    <!--<li>Make sure students understand that the social implications of technology are not all bad! None of us wants to live in a world without antibiotics. But the good social implications generally take care of themselves, whereas the bad ones require social action, redesign of the technology, research, and deep understanding.</li>-->

                            <strong>Learning Goals:</strong> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Understand that all digital information is represented with bits.</li>
                                <li>Appreciate the complex nature of privacy questions surrounding digital data.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>As a Class:</strong> After students read the selection, discuss briefly. Much of <em>Blown to Bits</em> has to do with the balance between the abundance of digital information and our attempts for retaining privacy and ownership of our own information. Students may also be interested in looking up news stories or videos about Tanya Rider.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't let the discussion be entirely about the details of her escape. The reason the authors of <em>Blown to Bits</em> chose this story to start the book is that it makes us think twice about the goal of privacy that otherwise pervades the book and most discussions of social implications. It was the protection of Ms. Rider's privacy that almost cost her life. The If There Is Time activity on this page tries to push students toward a nuanced, dialectical understanding of the privacy issue: neither a simplistic embracing of personal privacy nor a complete rejection of privacy as a goal will do.</li>

                	<strong>Page 2: Examining Privacy.</strong> Here are some possible answers to problem 2, Who is threatening your privacy?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Government threats to privacy are the easiest to see, especially in the post-Snowden era. It's important for students to understand that these threats aren't new; that's why the Constitution prohibited unwarranted search or seizure over 200 years ago. On the other hand, they should also understand how dramatically government behavior changed after 9/11. Besides the NSA and the police agencies, government threats include the IRS and more obscure data collection. For example, sales of real estate are public records, and often include Social Security numbers. This wasn't so important when you had to visit the county clerk's office to search the records, but now they're online.</li>
                        <li>The corporate threats everyone talks about are Google and Facebook. But the sharing of information among banks and credit bureaus is equally problematic. Internet Service Providers read the data you send or receive over the net. You can use DuckDuckGo for your web searches instead of Google, but it's hard to avoid using either the phone company or the cable company as your ISP (or your ISP's ISP). A loophole in the laws preventing national police data collection allows the police to buy the data from private companies that do the collection for them.</li>
                        <li>Smartphone owners can record video in public places. This has given rise to a culture of shaming. That can be a good thing when police brutality is documented by a passerby, but incidents like the widespread harassment of "<a href="http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/the_tale_of_dog_poop_girl_is_n.php" target="_blank" title="CJR: The Tale of Dog Poop Girl Is Not So Funny After All">Dog Poop Girl</a>" are troubling. (Since that first example, there have been several more online posting of videos of other dog poop violators.)</li>
