        <h2>Lab 4: Protecting Your Privacy</h2>
        <div class="todo">Mary still needs to review/revise this page. --MF, 5/26/20</div>
		<p> In the first two pages of this lab, students consider the information that is available online about them, discuss why privacy is good to protect, and consider reasons for giving up  privacy. The <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading is about innovations all around us that collect data about us. </p>
        <div class="endnote">
            <p>Among the social implications of computing, privacy is a major issue. Students should learn how they can best protect their online privacy, but must also learn that threats to privacy are a social construct, not a law of nature, and that they <em>shouldn't have to</em> worry so much about privacy. (This is a general point about teaching social implications: Don't make it a "computer ethics" course in which grownups tell kids what to do. Instead, it's more about how technology should be regulated in the interest of users.)</p>
            <p>When we first wrote this lab in 2010, privacy concerns were not widespread, and those who were concerned worried about government rather than about tech companies. This topic was a hard sell. But in 2019, with Facebook officers testifying to Congress all the time, many more people see the need to protect privacy.</p>
        </div>
		<p>Students begin to see that computing has social implications. The reading in <em>Blown to Bits</em> highlights ways the world has been changed by computing and identifies examples that might not look at first like a "bits story" but are. In this lab, students get a range of experiences: reading the book, beginning a list of computing innovations, and finding evidence for ways that technology can be both good and bad.</p>

            <h3 class="box-head">General Points about Teaching Social Implications</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Good discussions require trust.</strong> Students won't start out trusting each other or you (but mainly each other). It's vital that you catch any <em>ad hominem</em> argument or verbal bullying, make everyone stop talking, and quietly but clearly make it clear that personal attacks aren't acceptable behavior or valid arguments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't start with your own opinion, but</strong> if everyone in the class seems to take the opposite position, it can be beneficial for you to weigh in. Teachers should not use their position of authority  to imply that their opinion is the "right" one, but your opinions can be valuable as long as you hold yourself to the same standard of evidence you expect from students and as long as you convince them that their grade doesn't depend on agreeing with you. (Present your grading policy clearly and early to help build that trust.)</li>
                    <li>Most issues at first appear to have two opposing answers. <strong>Look for third positions</strong>&mdash;not a "compromise" but a genuinely different way of thinking.</li>
                    <div class="endnote" style="color: black">As one example of the power of a third position, the issue of copyright initially presents itself as "information wants to be free" versus "copying is theft," but any useful resolution has to start by noting that the interests of publishing companies (record labels, movie studios, etc.) are very different from the interests of creators (musicians, etc.). Maybe we need a solution that protects musicians, but we don't need a solution that protects record labels. Also, the badly-named "copyright" is not a <em>right</em> the way freedom of speech is a right. It is a <em>limited-time</em> legal monopoly, given to creators (and transferable to others) as part of a bargain through which their creations eventually enter the public domain. Does all that make illegal downloading okay? That's a hard question, not an obvious one.</div>
                    <li><strong>Everyone has the right to their opinion, but not all opinions are equally worthy.</strong> Nobody should be <em>punished</em> for their opinions (in this class or in the world), but the persuasive perspectives  are backed up with research and evidence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Start with Computing in the News as often as possible.</strong> Always bring in two stories, one about a wonderful advance in technology, and one about a social problem related to technology. If possible, after the first few examples, make <em>students</em> responsible for bringing in the two stories. Rotate through all the students if possible. Generally the stories will be presented quickly and <em>not discussed</em>; the opener generally shouldn't take over the class period, but if a particular story resonates with the students, you might allow a longer discussion.</li>
                    <!--<li>Make sure students understand that the social implications of technology are not all bad! None of us wants to live in a world without antibiotics. But the good social implications generally take care of themselves, whereas the bad ones require social action, redesign of the technology, research, and deep understanding.</li>-->
                </ul>

                            <strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Understand that all digital information is represented with bits.</li>
                                <li>Appreciate the complex nature of privacy questions surrounding digital data.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>As a Class:</strong> After students read the selection, discuss briefly. Much of <em>Blown to Bits</em> has to do with the balance between the abundance of digital information and our attempts for retaining privacy and ownership of our own information. Students may also be interested in looking up news stories or videos about Tanya Rider.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't let the discussion be entirely about the details of her escape. The reason the authors of <em>Blown to Bits</em> chose this story to start the book is that it makes us think twice about the goal of privacy that otherwise pervades the book and most discussions of social implications. It was the protection of Ms. Rider's privacy that almost cost her life. The If There Is Time activity on this page tries to push students toward a nuanced, dialectical understanding of the privacy issue: neither a simplistic embracing of personal privacy nor a complete rejection of privacy as a goal will do.</li>
