		<h2>Lab 2: Gossip</h2>
        <p>In Labs 2 and 3, students learn a new idea: not only can they assemble existing blocks (code) to create sequences (scripts), they can also encapsulate an entire script into a single new block of their own design, which they can then use as if that block had always existed. This process—one aspect of <em>abstraction</em>—is basic to computer science. Students will see how a multi-part script can be "hidden" inside a block (so students don't need to see all the details of the block while using it) and given a name (so they can easily know what it does, and can use it more than once).</p>
        <p>In  this lab, students program two sprites to gossip with each other, picking randomly from words and ideas that students specify. The context is whimsical&mdash;students generally enjoy teaching a computer to gossip and find the results funny&mdash;but the ideas they are learning are deep. Getting a computer to generate (and understand) natural language has been the serious work of computer scientists for decades; Siri is one of the results. Students first experiment with blocks that have been built for them, seeing what they do. Then they learn to <em>edit</em> and <em>modify</em> these blocks. Finally, they <em>create</em> a new block of their own using the same structure they've seen in the blocks they've edited, but with new content. In doing so, they will learn how to create lists of data, select data from those lists, and combine data in new ways. In Lab 3, they will extend this knowledge to another aspect of abstraction&mdash;learning how to give blocks inputs.</p>

                            <strong>Tips:</strong>
                            <ul>

                                <li>The starter project shows Snap<em>!</em>
				code with comments attached. Some students may
				<em>want</em> to comment some of their code,
				for their own information, but please don't
				<em>require</em> students to do so. This isn't
				a software engineering course preparing
				students for the workforce. Keep the focus in
				this first course on the beauty and joy.  In
				fact, if the question comes up, you should
				tell students that code written to teach, as
				in this project, will be <em>more</em> heavily
				commented than "real" production code.
				Comments on every block restating what it does
				in English make the code harder, not easier,
				to read.  One comment, at the beginning of a
				definition, can be useful to describe the
				intended purpose of the block, and/or its
				domain and range.</li>

				<li>A comment attached to the hat block at
				the beginning of the script in its definition
				will be used as the help text, if a user of
				the block selects "Help" from its context
				menu.</li>

				<li>In this lab, most of the actual directions
				for students are in the project starter file,
				rather than on the lab page.  We won't always
				use this approach, but its virtue is that
				students don't have to move their heads back
				and forth between the lab page and the project
				itself.</li>

				<li>After "For You To Do" 3, there is a yellow
				box with a clickable link -- what we call a
				"hint box" even though, as in this case,
				what's in the box isn't always a hint about the work.
				It's a small step toward accessibility for
				visually handicapped students.  Try not to
				let the class get caught up in this tool.</li>

				<li>FYTD 3 introduces the term "reporter" for
				blocks that report a value, as opposed to
				command blocks that just take some action.
				We are trying not to make a fuss about
				vocabulary at this point; just use the word
				yourself in appropriate contexts.  There will
				be a formal definition later.</li>

				<li>FYTD 8 is a very, very tentative
				introduction to <em>recursion,</em> here using
				<code>broadcast</code> blocks rather than
				procedure calls.  Please <em>don't</em>
				introduce the word "recursion" here, or make
				a fuss about how it works; the problem asks
				<em>students</em> to tell <em>you</em> what
				the code does.</li>

                                <li>Personalize the <code>who</code>, <code>does what</code>, and <code>who2</code> blocks by inserting phrases into the <code>list</code> blocks inside.</li>

				notation for <em>variadic</em> blocks (ones
				that take a variable number of inputs).</li>

                        	<strong>Tips: </strong>
                            <ul>

                                <li><s>Set clear expectations for the
				appropriateness of the student additions to
				the gossip project blocks.</s> Unless you
				have an especially hurt class, they will
				probably be funny but not hurtful or
				obscene in their inventions.  If a
				hurtful addition comes to your attention,
				<em>that's</em> the time to tell the class,
				not that a rule has been broken, but that
				they should be mindful of whether everyone
				in the class will find something funny.</li>

                                <li>It is probably too early to talk about
				abstraction and name it. Students will need to see more examples of it before
				it needs a piece of technical vocabulary. But two of its attributes may be
				worth mentioning even now: one, putting <img
				src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/item-(random)-of-(list-(Senora_my-cat_more)).png"
				alt="item-(random)-of-(list-(Señora_my-cat_more))"
				title="item-(random)-of-(list-(Señora_my-cat_more))" /> inside a block
				named <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/who.png" alt="who" title="who" />
				to make code easier to read and understand by "hiding the complexity," and two,
				using a simple name that describes the purpose of the code. Once we understand
				what <code>who</code> does and are assured that it works properly, we no
				longer need or want to see the guts of how it works.</li>

				<li>These one-liners don't hide <em>much</em>
				complexity.  If students aren't sold on the
				need to name these operations, don't argue.
				In this simple case, it'd probably just as
				good to put the lists in global variables and
				use <code>item (random) of (who-list)</code>
				instead.  But, of course, later they'll be
				writing blocks with more meat to them.</li>

				<li>The yellow box after (not inside) FYTD 1
				is important; it's yellow rather than orange
				because at this point the <code>report</code>
				block is given to them, so they don't have a
				chance to make this mistake.  Later, when
				they are writing their own blocks,
				misconceptions about the difference between
				<code>report</code> (which tells the computer
				some value) and <code>say</code> (which tells
				it to the user) are likely to come up.</li>

				<li><em>String</em> and <em>concatenate</em>
				are AP-speak.  We prefer to talk about words,
				sentences, and joining.  Make clear to
				students that they need to know the technical
				terms for the AP exam, but the more natural
				language is fine for real life, including
				real programming after the exam is behind
				them.</li>

				<li>About debugging:  These are very simple
				programs, and they may not have anything to
				debug.  But at least they should be sure of
				that by repeated testing.</li>

                        	<strong>Tips: </strong>
                            <ul>
			    	<li>This page is almost all mechanics, rather
				than big ideas.  You might want to make sure
				that both students of a pair get to make a
				new block.</li>

				<li>The vocabulary box formally introduces
				<em>reporters</em> and <em>commands</em>.
				Of course students have seen these words,
				and examples of what they mean, before this.
				The distinction is important in almost every
				programming language, although the names used
				for them differ.  Some languages use
				"procedure" for commands and "function" for
				reporters.  (The latter is a slight abuse
				of language, since a mathematical function
				always returns the same value for the same
				inputs, and that's not true of reporters;
				consider <code>random</code> as a
				counterexample.)  Some use "function" for
				both!  (This is a serious abuse of language!)
				Some languages, especially <em>functional</em>
				languages, require that <em>every</em>
				procedure return a value.  That makes life
				much simpler.  (For example, we wouldn't have
				to have <code>call</code> separate from
				<code>run</code>, or versions of <code>if</code>
				as a command and as a reporter.)  One of the
				few disadvantages of a graphical language is
				that we're stuck with the different block
				shapes fitting into different places in a
				script.</li>

				<li>Some additional vocabulary that we
				decided not to put in the student pages:
				A command or a reporter is a block, not a
				particular use of a block.  A reporter with
				its input slots filled in is an <b>expression</b>,
				and a command with its input slots filled in
				is an <b>instruction</b>.  It's best if you
				model using these words yourself, without
				asking students to memorize them.  This is
				formalized for you below.</li>

				<li>
				In the "On the AP Exam" box below, the second
				bullet is an AP vocabulary item, but we don't
				dignify it with that name because it's plainly
				incorrect -- procedures <em>are values</em>
				in themselves.  They should say "the value of
				a procedure <em>call</em>" or "the
				<em>return</em> value of a procedure call."</li>

                                <li>Conditionals and predicates are introduced here experientially and without any definitions. Resist the urge to "teach" these topics for now; the formalism will come in Unit 2.</li> 
                                <li>Students also get their first taste of recursion (procedures calling themselves) as they embed <code>more complicated who</code> inside <code>more complicated who</code>. Like with conditionals and predicates, these ideas do not need to be formalized yet, and mastery is not expected. Students see dabble in recursion again throughout the next few units, and the final two units (after the AP exam) address this topic in detail. </li>
				<li>FYTD 7-8 are another toe-dip into recursion.
				You are not expected to teach the word or the idea,
				just to be prepared for student questions about it.</li>

                <p>This list is okay, except that there is no <em>explicit</em> discussion of abstraction.  At minimum, there should be a gray box on the first page (moved from wherever it is now).  But this is a central idea, and it deserves an orange box pointing out that <code>who</code>, for example, isn't built into Snap<em>!</em>, but once it's built you can use it in your program just as if it were built in.  Also, we need a gray box for "concatenation" (not substring, which doesn't happen in this lab, since plural was removed). -bh</p>
                <p>Thanks Brian, Please feel free to make the changes you suggest above, but please be sure that someone reviews them. --MF, 7/20/17</p>

			<h4>Enduring Understandings:</h4>
			<div class="todo">Students edit and create custom blocks that hide the details of the underlying code (<strong>EU 2.2</strong>, <strong>EU 5.3</strong>). This lab builds toward these EUs by introducing abstraction in the context of conversation: the program constructs a sentence by appending a noun phrase, a verb phrase, and a second noun phrase, and each phrase is itself another procedure that selects its output randomly from a list prescribed by the student.</div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>EU 2.2</strong> Multiple levels of abstraction are used to write programs or create other computational artifacts.</li>
                <li><strong>EU 5.3</strong> Programming is facilitated by appropriate abstractions.</li>
			</ul>	
            <h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
            <div class="todo">Following the model blocks provided in the starter project for this early lab, students create custom noun block (<strong>LO 2.2.1</strong>) that masks the complexity (<strong>LO 5.3.1</strong>) of the program.</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>LO 2.2.1</strong> Develop an abstraction when writing a program or creating other computational artifacts. [P2]</li>
                <li><strong>LO 5.3.1</strong> Use abstraction to manage complexity in programs. [P3]</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Essential Knowledge:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EK 2.2.1A</strong> The process of developing an abstraction involves removing detail and generalizing functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.2.1B</strong> An abstraction extracts common features from specific examples in order to generalize concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.3.1A</strong> Procedures are reusable programming abstractions.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.3.1C</strong> Procedures reduce the complexity of writing and maintaining programs.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.3.1D</strong> Procedures have names and may have parameters and return values.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.3.1I</strong> Strings and string operations, including concatenation and some form of substring, are common in many programs.</li>
            </ul>
