		<h2>Lab 2: Gossip</h2>
        <p>In Labs 2 and 3, students learn a new idea: not only can they assemble existing blocks (code) to create sequences (scripts), they can also encapsulate an entire script into a single new block of their own design, which they can then use as if that block had always existed. This process—one aspect of <em>abstraction</em>—is basic to computer science. Students will see how a multi-part script can be "hidden" inside a block (so students don't need to see all the details of the block while using it) and given a name (so they can easily know what it does and can use it more than once).</p>
        <p>In  this lab, students program two sprites to gossip with each other, picking randomly from words and ideas that students specify. The context is whimsical&mdash;students generally enjoy teaching a computer to gossip and find the results funny&mdash;but the ideas they are learning are deep. Getting a computer to generate (and understand) natural language has been the serious work of computer scientists for decades; Siri is one of the results. Students first experiment with blocks that have been built for them, seeing what they do. Then they learn to <em>edit</em> and <em>modify</em> these blocks. Finally, they <em>create</em> a new block of their own using the same structure they've seen in the blocks they've edited but now with new content. In doing so, they will learn how to create lists of data, select data from those lists, and combine data in new ways. In Lab 3, they will extend this knowledge to another aspect of abstraction&mdash;learning how to give blocks inputs.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Now is the time for classroom management and introduction to any other classroom technology students will use.</li>
			<li>
				Be sure students understand that are expected to read all the material presented and complete all the "For You To Do" problems with only the following exceptions:
				<ul>
					<li>Yellow boxes are optional reading.  Some longer ones are hidden behind a clickable link so as not to make the page seem so long.</li>
					<li>"If There Is Time..." and "Take It Further" problems are <em>not required</em>. (These are provided for students to work on after finishing the required reading and problems. "If There Is Time..." problems are generally about as difficult as "For You To Do" problems, but "Take It Further" problems are often harder. If pairs have finished their assigned work, they can go ahead and start on some of these extra problems and don't have to wait for permission.)  These are <i>all</i> hidden behind clickable links.</li>

                                    Some students may resist pair programming, arguing that they work better alone. Tell them to give pair programming an honest try during the first lab or two, and <em>then</em> you'll entertain ideas about modifying the way the pair works if they still want that.

                                        <li>Programmers in industry often work in pairs, but the specific driver/navigator structure of pair programming isn't really how they do it, for the most part.  Programmers who are accustomed to working collaboratively find ways to fit together that take advantage of each person's strong points, and they change styles of work depending on the specific task -- is it coding, or data design, or documentation?  Pair programming is a simplified type of collaboration that lets students experience different roles in a team.  If students complain that it feels artificial, you can agree, and explain that it's like beginning at any other skill: You do it in a precise way, following all the rules to the letter.</li>

                                    <strong>Lost on the Moon.</strong>  This is an exercise in cooperation.  It's a great one, because almost every time, the group does better than any of its individuals, so it helps convince students that cooperation works.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><em>"What does this have to do with computer science?"</em>  The subject matter of the exercise (astronaut survival) was deliberately chosen as one that none of the students is likely to know anything about.  (By contrast, it's quite likely that some of your students have been programming since they were eight, while others won't have had that experience.) Even so, their group discussions, which seem like they'd be the lost leading the lost, lead to much better results than any member of the group individually.  Rest assured (and assure your students) that we haven't forgotten what the course is about.  But <em>this page</em> of the course is about how to work cooperatively, not about programming.  It's just one class session, and it'll pay off all year.</li>
                                        <li><em>Why isn't this optional? </em> We think this is a great activity, but also, it meets a specific AP CSP Framework requirement (CRD-1.C) that requires an activity, not just reading.</li>
                                        <li>
                                            How it works: Divide the class into groups of three or four.  (Four is better because even numbers discourage voting.)  The first part of the exercise is individual; if you want, you can defer organizing groups until after that.
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Hand out the first handout with the list of supplies facing up.  Read the introductory paragraph with the class.</li>
                                                <li>Students work individually, no talking, for 10-15 minutes.  They assign number 1 to the most important item for their survival, number 15 for the least important.</li>
                                                <li><em>Before handing out the solutions,</em> explain to students that they're going to do the same exercise again in groups. But first, tell them to turn the sheet over.  Read the suggestions about cooperation with them.  These suggestions are counterintuitive!  They go against the entire "hidden curriculum" of their lives.
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>We live in a competitive culture.  Young people will have a learned instinct to treat an exercise like this one as a competition; their goal is to get the group to agree with them.  One thing that might help some students is the analogy with a team sport; you want your team to win, but that won't happen unless you cooperate instead of competing within the team.</li>
                                                    <li>Much of what students have been taught about how to cooperate is wrong.  Most importantly, "compromise" is a very bad idea <em>when the choices have reasons.</em>  If your family is discussing what kind of food to have for dinner, and you want Chinese, and your sibling wants pizza, these are just arbitrary matters of taste and whim, and it's great if everyone can compromise on Korean barbecue.  But in this exercise, there are good reasons why some choices are better than others, and compromise is deadly (literally, if you really were on the moon).  Instead of focusing on my answers vs. your answers, focus on understanding each other's <em>reasons.</em>  Look for solutions that respect both reasons, rather than "splitting the difference" of the actual answers.</li>
                                                    <li>The second big thing students have learned about making group decisions is voting.  It's democratic!  Yes, voting makes sense when the voters have different <em>real interests:</em> I'm an employer and you're a worker, or I'm a farmer and you're a programmer, etc.  In those situations, voting is a sort of nonviolent warfare; the stronger team wins.  Legislatures have this character; they're not deliberative bodies looking for a solution for everyone, but representatives of interest groups fighting for political or economic advantage.  When you're all on the same team, voting is a really bad idea, because there's no guarantee that the initially most popular idea is the <em>best</em> idea.</li>
                                                    <li>Cooperation doesn't mean to let someone else have their way.  Just as it's not about winning, it's not about losing.  Try to pay attention only to the proposals, and the reasoning behind the proposals, and not who made the proposal.  Good reasons should be persuasive, not loud voices.</li>
                                                </ul></li>
                                                <li>Now divide the class into groups, and have them do the same exercise again.  Their goal is to get the best possible answers for their group.  Give them 10 minutes.</li>
                                                <li>Now hand out the official NASA solutions.  Both group and individual scores are computed by, for each item, computing the (absolute value of the) difference between the student ranking and the NASA ranking, then adding the 15 item scores.  A low score is good.</li>
                                                <li><em>Debriefing.</em>  Expect a lot of "it's not fair" complaints.  "It's not fair; how were we supposed to know there's no magnetic field on the moon?"  Don't get defensive; remind students that the exercise deliberately asks about a topic nobody in the class has studied or experienced.  You'd expect that individual and group scores would both be random.  And yet, even in this extreme situation, groups beat individuals.  Be sure that the fairness complaints don't prevent that comparison by taking all the time.  First have them guess how many students did better than their groups.  Then find out:  "Hands up if your individual score was better than your group score."  There won't be very many hands.  It's really remarkable how well this works; typically <em>every</em> student does worse than their group.</li>

                                <li>Some of the sentences that the program makes are silly, such as "my cat  loves my cat"; encourage students to enjoy that rather than trying to  "fix" it. </li>
                                <li>The starter project shows Snap<em>!</em> code with comments attached. Some students may <em>want</em> to comment some of their code, for their own information, but please don't <em>require</em> students to do so. This isn't a software engineering course preparing students for the workforce. Keep the focus in this first course on the beauty and joy.  In fact, if the question comes up, you should tell students that code written to teach, as in this project, will be <em>more</em> heavily commented than "real" production code. Comments on every block restating what it does in English make the code harder, not easier, to read.  One comment, at the beginning of a definition, can be useful to describe the intended purpose of the block and/or its domain and range.

                                            A comment attached to the hat block at the beginning of the script in its definition will be used as the help text, if a user of the block selects "Help" from its context menu.<br />

                                <li>In this lab, most of the actual directions for students are in the project starter file, rather than on the lab page.  BJC doesn't always use this approach, but its virtue is that students don't have to move their heads back and forth between the lab page and the project itself.</li>
                                <li>This page introduces the term "reporter" for blocks that report a value, as opposed to command blocks that just take some action. This first exploration of these block types is not the time to teach vocabulary; just use the appropriate words yourself.  Formal definitions come later.</li>
                                <li>Making Sprite(2) tell Sprite to respond is a tentative introduction to <em>recursion</em>, here using <code>broadcast</code> blocks rather than procedure calls. As with "reporter," this is just a first taste. Formal introduction will come later.</li>

                                <li>Most students will be funny and not hurtful or obscene in their inventions. You don't need to preemptively protect against that, but if it happens, <em>that's</em> the time to tell the class that they should be mindful of whether everyone in the class (including you) will find something funny.</li>
                                <li><div class="todo">This is a little awkward... --MF, 5/21/19</div>It is probably too early to talk about abstraction and name it. Students will need to see more examples of it before it needs a piece of technical vocabulary. But two of its attributes may be worth mentioning even now: one, putting <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/item-(random)-of-(list-(Senora_my-cat_more)).png" alt="item-(random)-of-(list-(Señora_my-cat_more))" title="item-(random)-of-(list-(Señora_my-cat_more))" /> inside a block named <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/who.png" alt="who" title="who" /> to make code easier to read and understand by "hiding the complexity," and two, using a simple name that describes the purpose of the code. Once we understand what <code>who</code> does and are assured that it works properly, we no longer need or want to see the guts of how it works.</li>
                                <li><div class="todo">I don't love this bullet. Also: <code>item (random) of (who-list)</code>??--MF, 5/21/19 </div>These one-liners don't hide <em>much</em> complexity.  If students aren't sold on the need to name these operations, don't argue. In this simple case, it'd probably be just as good to put the lists in global variables and use <code>item (random) of (who-list)</code> instead.  But, of course, later they'll be writing blocks with more meat to them.</li>
                                <li>The yellow box after (not inside) FYTD 1 is important; it's yellow rather than orange because at this point the <code>report</code> block is given to them, so they don't have a chance to make this mistake.  Later, when they are writing their own blocks, misconceptions about the difference between <code>report</code> (which tells the computer some value) and <code>say</code> (which tells it to the user) are likely to come up.</li>
                                <li><div class="todo">Snarky --MF, 5/21/19</div><em>String</em> and <em>concatenate</em> are language from the AP exam.  BJC uses "words," "sentences," and "joining."  Make clear to students that they need to know the technical terms for the AP exam, but the more natural language is fine for real life, including real programming after the exam is behind them.</li>
                                <li>About debugging:  These are very simple programs, and they may not have anything to debug.  But at least students should be sure of that by repeated testing.</li>

                                <li>This page is almost all mechanics, rather than big ideas.  You might want to make sure that both students of a pair get to make a new block.</li>
                                <li>The vocabulary box formally introduces <em>reporters</em> and <em>commands</em>. Of course students have seen these words, and examples of what they mean, before this. The distinction is important in almost every programming language, although the names used for them differ.  Some languages use "procedure" for commands and "function" for reporters.  (The latter is a slight abuse of language, since a mathematical function always returns the same value for the same inputs, and that's not true of all reporters; consider <code>random</code> as a counterexample.)  Some use "function" for both!  (This is a serious abuse of language!) Some languages, especially <em>functional</em> languages, require that <em>every</em> procedure return a value.  That makes life much simpler.  (For example, we wouldn't have to have <code>call</code> separate from <code>run</code>, or separate versions of <code>if</code> as a command and as a reporter.)  One of the few disadvantages of a graphical language is that we're stuck with the different block shapes fitting into different places in a script.</li>
                                <li>Some additional vocabulary that we decided not to put in the student pages: A command or a reporter is a block, not a particular use of a block.  A reporter with its input slots filled in is an <b>expression</b>, and a command with its input slots filled in is an <b>instruction</b>.  It's best if you model using these words yourself, without asking students to memorize them.  This is formalized for you below.</li>
                                <li> In the "On the AP Exam" box below, the second bullet is an AP vocabulary item, but we don't dignify it with that name because it's plainly incorrect -- procedures <em>are values</em> in themselves.  They should say "the value of a procedure <em>call</em>" or "the <em>return</em> value of a procedure call."</li>

                                <li>Explore more complicated reporter that introduces conditionals and predicates.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Conditionals and predicates are introduced here experientially and without any definitions. Resist the urge to "teach" these topics for now; the formalism will come in Unit 2.</li> 
                                <li>Students also get their first taste of recursion (procedures calling themselves) as they embed <code>more complicated who</code> inside <code>more complicated who</code>. As with conditionals and predicates, these ideas do not need to be formalized yet, and mastery is not expected. Students  dabble in recursion again throughout the next few units, and the final two units (after the AP exam) address this topic in detail. </li>
                                <li>FYTD 8-9 are another toe-dip into recursion. You are not expected to teach the word or the idea, just to be prepared for student questions about it.</li>

                                    Here is some vocabulary for <em>you</em> to use in context, not to require of students...

The procedure contains <pre class="inline">block of statements</pre> and returns the value of <pre class="inline">expression</pre>. The <pre class="inline">RETURN</pre> statement may appear at any point inside the procedure and causes an immediate return from the procedure back to the calling statement.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-3.E.1:</strong> The exam reference sheet provides <pre class="inline">RANDOM(a, b)</pre> which generates and returns a random integer from <pre class="inline">a</pre> to <pre class="inline">b</pre>, inclusive. Each result is equally likely to occur. For example, <pre class="inline">RANDOM(1, 3)</pre> could return 1, 2, or 3.</li>
