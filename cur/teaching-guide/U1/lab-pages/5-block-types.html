	    <h2>Programming Lab 5: Block Types and Calculations</h2>
		<p>Students continue experimenting with and combining blocks as they formalize their understanding of the Snap<em>!</em>intterface (sprite position and direction) and blocks. Students learn to differentiate between <strong>command blocks</strong> (including loops and conditionals), <strong>reporter blocks</strong> (and <strong>watchers</strong>), and <strong>predicates</strong> (including Boolean constant blocks). After most of a unit exploring a variety of blocks, students now learn how block shapes relate to their functionality and how the different types of blocks tend to relate (reporters inside commands and other reporters, Booleans inside predicates, predicates inside predicates, predicates inside conditionals, etc.).</p>
        <p>Students also explore a variety of math reporters (from the Operators palette) including basic operations, <code>round</code>, <code>mod</code>, and logical operators (<code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>) and refine their understanding of the <code>random</code> block as they refine their understanding of block relationships.</p> 
        

        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 4 lab pages could be split across one or two days (35-55 minutes). Expected times to complete follow: <ul>
                <li>5-10 minutes on Sprite Position and Direction</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Expressions and Operations</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Predicates and Logic</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on <code>Random</code> Block Self Check</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
