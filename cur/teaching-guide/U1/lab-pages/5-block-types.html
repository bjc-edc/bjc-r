	    <h2>Programming Lab 5: Block Types and Calculations</h2>
		<p>Students continue experimenting with and combining blocks as they formalize their understanding of sprite state (position and direction) and blocks. Students learn to differentiate between <strong>command blocks</strong> (including loops and conditionals), <strong>reporter blocks</strong>, and <strong>predicates</strong> (including Boolean constant blocks). After most of a unit exploring a variety of blocks, students now learn how block shapes relate to their functionality.</p>
        <p>Students also explore a variety of math reporters (from the Operators palette) including basic operations, <code>round</code>, <code>mod</code>, and logical operators (<code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>) and refine their understanding of the <code>random</code> block.</p> 
        

        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 4 lab pages could be split across one or two days (35-55 minutes). Expected times to complete follow: <ul>
                <li>5-10 minutes on Sprite Position and Direction</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Expressions and Operations</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Predicates and Logic</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on <code>Random</code> Block Self Check</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <ul>
        	<li>Remind students that they can run scripts by clicking on them, including reporters, which will report their  result in a speech balloon next to the block.</li>
        	<li>Some teachers have complained about the use of compass directions rather than Cartesian directions. Here's some history:
        	  <ul>
        	    <li>This tradition started in Logo in the 1980s and was inherited by Scratch, then by us.</li>
        	    <li>In Logo, the turtle had the arrowhead shape that's our default, and  pointed up by default. This is the right thing for fractal trees, and as good as anything for other turtle geometry exercises like the ones in BJC.</li>
        	    <li>Scratch shifted the focus from turtle graphics to animation of characters, so sprites have costumes, such as their trademark cat, that move mostly horizontally. So they ended up with Logo's compass directions, but with a default direction of East (90 degrees).</li>
        	    <li>The choice of direction measure in Snap<em>!</em> is motivated mostly by the desire to be compatible with Scratch, so that we have access to their 10 million uploaded projects.</li>
      	      </ul>
              For teachers who want to use
        	Snap<em>!</em> in teaching mathematics, it's easy enough to build your own angle blocks:<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/setangle.png" alt="set angle (x)  point in direction 90-x"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/angle.png" alt="angle:  report (90-direction) mod 360"><br />
        	You can
            even convert to/from radians if you prefer.</li>
        	<li>Some vocabulary (for you, not to impose on students except by example):
        	  <ul>
        	    <li>A <em>command</em> is a single Lego-brick-shaped block, without inputs.</li>
        	    <li>A <em>reporter</em> is a single oval-shaped block, without inputs.</li>
        	    <li>A <em>predicate</em> is a single hexagonal block, without inputs.</li>
        	    <li>An <em>instruction</em> is a command block along with its input expressions.</li>
        	    <li>An <em>expression</em> is a reporter block along with its input expressions.</li>
        	    <li>A <em>Boolean expression</em> is a predicate block along with its input expressions.</li>
        	    <li>A <em>Boolean value</em> is <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true"> or <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false">. (Not the text strings &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;; not 0 and 1.)</li>
      	      </ul>
              So a reporter
        	or a predicate is a function; an expression is a function applied to arguments.</li>
       	</ul>
