        <h2>Social Implications Lab 5: Explosion of Bits; Games and Violence</h2>
 
        <div class="todo">MF: A teacher at the August PD was asking for some kind of written assignment (a docx of prompts or something) to help hold students accountable for their discussions&mdash;so teachers will know that the students are actually having these discussions.</div>
        
        <div class="sidenote">Why are social implications important?
        <ul>
        	<li>People should be aware of the social issues concerning computer technology and have ways to think about these issues constructively.</li>
            <li>Especially in professional work, it can prepare people to better deal with issues of ethics, values, and safety they will likely encounter.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Students begin to see that there are many social implications to computing. The <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading highlights ways the world has been changed by computing and identifies examples that might not look at first like a "bits story" but are. In this lab, students get a range of experiences, including reading the book, beginning to compile a list of computing innovations, debating the hot topic of whether violent video games cause youth violence, and finding evidence for ways that technology can be both good and bad.</p> 
        <p>Activities related to finding and describing computing innovations helps prepare students for the AP Explore Performance Task. The writing and video exercises (such as making a video about an innovation, supporting a claim about privacy using evidence, supporting a claim about video games using evidence, and brainstorming evidence for claims about whether technology is good or bad) also prepare students for the Explore Task. Important AP topics that are addressed in this Lab include a preliminary exploration of bits and beginning to examine a broad range of computing innovations.</p>
        
        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
            The 5 lab pages span the week. Expected times:
            <ul>
                <li>20-25 minutes on Getting Started</li>
                <li>
                    30-40 minutes on Computing Innovations
                    <ul>
                        <li>This could take longer if students do the Take It Further activity and spend time in class to make and show their videos.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>40-50 minutes on Tanya Rider's Story, including an unplugged activity about binary numbers</li>
                <li>30-40 minutes on Do violent video games contribute to youth violence?</li>
                <li>40-50 minutes on Is technology good or bad?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
        
        <div class="sidenote">Past teachers have come up with potential reading questions and prompts about <em>Blown to Bits</em>:
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="http://tinyurl.com/supd-2014-reading" target="_blank">From teachers in Summer 2014</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://tinyurl.com/bjc4nyc-2015-reading" target="_blank">From NYC teachers in Summer 2015</a></li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="sidenote">Options for students to access <em>Blown to Bits</em> include reading it as an <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter1.pdf" target="_blank">online PDF</a>, purchasing hard copies of the book, or photocopying pages so students can make annotations as they read.</div>
        
            <ul>
                <li>If you haven't yet, make sure you use <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> as an opener this week.</li>
                <li>Consider using unused openers from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/Week01/W01-activities.html" target="_blank">Week 1</a> and <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/Week02/W02-activities.html" target="_blank">Week 2</a>. Students may find that some of these ideas are clearer after stepping away from the computer and giving the ideas time to sink in.</li>
                <li>Think about how you want students to interact with computers and each other this week. Students will need to be on the computer at times to do some online research. You may choose to print out <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">Chapter 1 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a> so that students can annotate as they read. Students will also engage in discussion with each other, so think of a way to arrange your space so students can have eye contact with each other.</li>
                <li>Review all lab activities, especially the <a href="http://csunplugged.org/binary-numbers/" target="_blank">binary numbers activity</a> and the debate activities included with Do violent video games contribute to youth violence? (<a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Skill-5-Counterargument-DRMO-One-Pager.docx" target="_blank">making counterarguments</a>) and Is technology good or bad? (<a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Brainstorm-Game-Narrative.pdf" target="_blank">brainstorm game</a>).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Students will:</h3>
        <div class="sidenoteBig">
        	<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
        	<ul>
            	<li>The discussions, research, writing, and video presentations about technological innovations and their impacts are meant to prepare students for the AP Explore Performance Task.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Write a brief "technology autobiography."</li>
                <li>Brainstorm some computing innovations and start to identify their positive and negative impacts.</li>
                <li>Read <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">Chapter 1 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a>.</li>
                <li>Do a short <a href="http://csunplugged.org/binary-numbers/" target="_blank">activity about binary numbers</a> to get a sense for why we care about "bits."</li>
                <li>Examine arguments on both sides of the debate on whether violent video games contribute to youth violence.</li>
                <li>Learn to see ways in which technology has the capacity for both good and bad.</li>
            </ul>
        </div> 
              
        
        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div class="classIndent">
            <h4>Getting Started</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Depending on your class, you might have students share their "technology autobiographies" with each other.</li>
                <div class="sidenote"> Creativity is one of the Big Ideas of the course</div>
                <li>In particular, listen for students who describe ways they use technology to <em>create</em>. If students don't identify this now, we hope they do by the end of the year.</li>
                <li>Also listen for the adjectives students use to describe their relationship with technology. One of the goals of the course is that, by the end, students will identify themselves as belonging in the world of computer science. Students' sense of identity and agency will ideally change as they see themselves as producers, and not just consumers, of technology.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Computing Innovations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>For a fast-paced brainstorming activity (problem 1), pass out several whiteboard markers at a time and have students put ideas on the board and pass the markers to each other.</li>
                <li>Take a picture of the board or otherwise record the responses (such as in a classwide Google doc). Throughout the year, build on this list as a resource for students for when they choose an innovation to write about for the AP Explore Performance Task.</li>
                <li>Take It Further: The technology you use to make videos will depend on what is available to you. Students might capture videos on their phones (this can be assigned for homework if they are not allowed to use phones in the school) or use software like iMovie or <a href="http://screencast-o-matic.com" target="_blank">Screencast-o-matic</a>.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4>Tanya Rider's Story</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Much of <em>Blown to Bits</em> has to do with the balance between the abundance of digital information and our attempts for retaining privacy and ownership of our own information. After students read the selection, discuss briefly. Students may also be interested in looking up news stories or videos about Tanya Rider.</li>
                <div class="sidenote">This activity about binary numbers is just a <em>taste</em> of an idea they will see again later in the year.</div>
                <li><em>Blown to Bits</em> briefly mentions that bits are "zeroes and ones." To give students a sense for how zeroes and ones can encode information, use <a href="http://csunplugged.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/unplugged-01-binary_numbers.pdf" target="_blank">the first activity (Binary Numbers) on pages 5-6</a> from csunplugged.org (the link on the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/6-intro-bits-games/tanya-rider.html" target="_blank">student page</a> only includes pages 5-6). You can also check out the <a href="http://csunplugged.org/binary-numbers/" target="_blank">main page for the activity</a>. Note that students will learn about binary in more detail later in the year&mdash;the objective here is to see that a sequence of 0s and 1s can encode information.</li>
                <li>Take It Further: Privacy as a social implications topic will be discussed in depth in Unit 2 and is a recurring theme, so you can skip this activity if you don't have time.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4>Do violent video games contribute to youth violence?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Let students know that they will have the opportunity to examine evidence from both sides of the debate. To open the activity, consider having students place themselves along a continuum in the room. Call one side of your classroom "strongly agree" and the other side "strongly disagree" and have students stand in a line according to their current view on whether violent video games contribute to youth violence.
                <ul>
                    <li>Students are expressing their opinion and there may be disagreements. Tell students that they will get a chance to examine these views more in depth today and that it is quite possible for opinions to change based on learning more evidence. Also, there are many reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with this statement, and it is important that the classroom will be a safe place to consider evidence from both sides thoughtfully.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <div class="sidenote">The emphasis of this activity is to identify <em>evidence</em> to back up a claim.</div>
                <li>Depending on your students, you might randomly assign students to either pro or con (e.g., by flipping a coin), have them skim through the evidence and decide for themselves, or assign them the opposite view from what they expressed when they stood on the continuum. Give students 15-20 minutes to read through the information presented on the websites (and do their own research, if they wish) about their side and identify three pieces of evidence they find most convincing.</li>
                <li>Have students trade papers with a partner and read each others' three pieces of evidence. Students may discuss further in pairs, small groups, or as a class.</li>
                <li>As time permits, do the other activities on the student page (explain data, make a video, make a video of a counterargument). If you don't have time to make videos, you might still do an activity around counterarguments. For example, use the <a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Activity-10-Skill-4-Counterargument-Class-Challenge.docx" target="_blank">Counterargument Class Challenge template</a> from the Boston Debate League.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Is technology good or bad?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Brainstorm-Game-Narrative.pdf" target="_blank">Brainstorm Game</a> is another teaching resource from the Boston Debate League. You can choose to play this as a game or simply present this as a writing/discussion activity. This activity can also follow the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/Week03/W03-activities.html" target="_blank"> Snap Judgment opener</a> <strong>Is technology good or bad?</strong>.</li>
                <li>After reading the last section of Chapter 1 of <em>Blown to Bits</em>, have a class discussion about how technology can be both good and bad. Students can also share about their computing innovation as an example of a technology that can help and hurt.</li>
                <li>Take It Further: If you do this section, have students in small groups read about just <em>one</em> of the Koans and prepare to teach the rest of the class about what they read.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        


        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <div>
        <ul>
        	<li>Talk to English Language Arts teachers at your school to learn the strategies your students know for annotating texts. Encourage use of these close reading strategies.</li>
        </ul>
