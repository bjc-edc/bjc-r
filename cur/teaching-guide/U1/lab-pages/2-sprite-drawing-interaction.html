        <h2>Programming Lab 2: Sprite Drawing and Interaction</h2>
        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-square.png" alt="pen down, repeat 4 (move 50 steps, turn CW 90 degrees)" title="pen down, repeat 4 (move 50 steps, turn CW 90 degrees)" />
        <p>Students program sprites to move, draw, and interact. Students write a script to draw a square and then modify the input values and discuss the results. They also create scripts in which a sprite follows the mouse around the stage and senses the position of a second sprite. They learn to use two looping <strong>control</strong> structures for which conditions can be set.</p>
        <p>Students build experience with loops and conditionals without yet formalizing. Resist the urge to "teach" these concepts at the outset; instead, allow students to learn how these work <em>in context</em>, applying them to their programs. Students will get lots of experience with loops and conditionals and will codify this learning later.</p>

                	To launch this lab&mdash;Make a Prediction: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UlHWatINw9crcqeA0hjDb1n-toPSNtmSfegBM5zXCbw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Repeat, Move, Turn</a>
                    <ul>
						<li>Project the script and ask students to predict what it does (discuss in small groups and/or as a class).</li>
						<li>Discussion: Ask students "How do programs implement algorithms?" Listen for students to recognize that programs <em>execute instructions in order (sequentially)</em> and <em>process each next step automatically</em>.</li>
                    </ul>

                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" />
                <li>Several blocks that students will use in Unit 1 including <code>tell</code> and <code>for</code> are  available only after importing tools from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu. This may change in a forthcoming update to Snap<em>!</em>, but for now remind students to <strong>import tools</strong> if a block they seek appears to be missing. </li>
                <li>
					<strong>Page 1: Drawing and Motion.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>The first page of this lab gives students a simple script to draw a square and asks them to experiment with it, changing various numbers in the script and observing the results. Students who are accustomed to being told exactly what to do may flounder. Tell them that Creativity is one of the Big Ideas of Computer Science Principles and that in this sort of exploratory lesson there are <em>no wrong answers</em>.</li>
		                <li>Take note of any interesting approaches or creative ideas that would be good to share with the class.</li>

					<strong>Page 3: Sprite Interaction.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>This page has a conversation in Haitian Creole, Russian, English, and Spanish.  Make sure students understand that they are to <em>make up their own conversation</em>. The point of this example is to show that students can use whatever language(s) they like in their programs. Watch for students who have become so used to "doing what the book says" that they get stuck trying to copy this text. Encourage them to use their own creativity!</li>
