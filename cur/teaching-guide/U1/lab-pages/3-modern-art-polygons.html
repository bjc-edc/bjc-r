        <p>Students program sprites to move, turn and draw. Students also learn how to use two looping <strong>control</strong> structures for which conditions can be set.  They will then apply their knowledge to creating original art works at the end of the Unit.</p>
        <!--<p>Students build experience with loops and conditionals without yet formalizing. Resist the urge to "teach" these concepts at the outset; instead, allow students to learn how these work <em>in context</em>, applying them to their programs. Students will get lots of experience with loops and conditionals and will codify this learning later.</p>-->

                                    A recent update to Chrome introduced a bug that affects the Snap! <code>set pen color to</code> block with the square picture of the actual color (not the block with a color <em>number</em>). Until this is fixed, there are two workarounds:

                                <li>This page is one of students' earliest encounters with the concept of <em>abstraction</em> in Computer Science.  Giving an input parameter to a block generalizes its functionality, enabling it to accomplish a wider variety of tasks.  Unless, this first encounter with <em>abstraction</em> is highlighted, most students may miss what a big deal it is.</li>
                                <li>As a foreshadowing to the upcoming pages, ask students to anticipate how they can further generalize the <code>pinwheel</code> block by introducing more input parameters.</li>
                                <li>Most students may not yet be quite ready to explore artistic applications of the <code>pinwheel</code> block as shown in the Take It Further.  These are intended as thought-provoking ideas that they can come back to later in the Unit.</li>

                                <li>It may be a good idea to highlight that in this page students will be further generalizing the <code>pinwheel</code> block by by introducing more input parameters.  Again, this is an example of <em>abstraction</em>.</li>

                                <li>Some students may find writing the <code>polygon</code> block difficult or they may not have intuition about how the code would work.  Encourage them to look at the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/5a-polygonal-racetracks.html" target="_blank">Polygonal Racetracks</a> activity linked in an adjacent yellow box.</li>

                                    On the If There Is Time circle block-building problem, the students may need help discovering what should the one input be for a <code>circle</code> block.  A natural choice for the single input would be "radius".  The students may need a reminder from the previous page that a regular polygon with a large number of sides, for example a 30-gon, is a good approximation for a circle.  The difficulty in this case will be determining the "side length" of the approximating polygon.  Students can discover this by experimenting or it may be helpful to remind them that for a regular polygon:<br />
                                    <span class="katex indent">\text{side length} = \frac{\text{perimeter}}{\text{number of sides}} \approx \frac{2 \pi \cdot \text{radius}} {\text{number of sides}}</span>

                                    The <code>for</code> block is available only after importing tools from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu. This may change in a forthcoming update to Snap<em>!</em>, but for now remind students to <strong>import tools</strong> if a block they seek appears to be missing. 
                                </li>
                                <li>Highlight that the <code> for</code> block, in addition to providing looping functionality like to the <code>forever</code> and <code>repeat</code> blocks, also provides access to the individual stages of a loop with the use of a counter; this enhances the possibilities of what can be achieved by looping.</li>
                                <li>
                                    <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/U1ImageVideoAddendum_img/U1L3p5TG-backwardsLoop.png" height="90" alt="for (i) = (10) to (1) [say (i) for (0.5) secs]" title="for (i) = (10) to (1) [say (i) for (0.5) secs]" />
                                    Most students may not realize that it is possible to loop backwards with the <code>for</code> block by letting the index start from a larger number and end with a smaller number as shown at right. This code will have the sprite count backwards from 10 to 1.

            <ul>
            	<li>
                    <strong>Mathematics Note: Direction.</strong> Snap! reports the direction that a sprite is facing using a system similar to that used by a magnetic compass:
                    <ul>
                        <li>0 is straight up, facing the top of the screen</li>
                        <li>90 faces the right-hand side of the screen</li>
                        <li>180 points "due south"</li>
                        <li>270 faces the left-hand side of the screen</li>
                    </ul>
                    The inputs to the <code>point in direction</code> block can be any number, and this gives an opportunity to talk about different inputs to <code>point in direction</code> that produce the same effect. Try, for example, turning on the <var>direction</var> reporter in the Motion palette (it reports the direction of the sprite), but try using <code>point in direction</code> with an input of -20 and then again with an input of 340. The sprite points the same way&mdash;nothing changes&mdash;but direction reports -20 and then 340. Clearly, -20 &ne; 340, but they differ by 360:
                    <span class="katex-block">340 = -20 + 360</span>
                    Sprite direction is determined only up to multiples of 360, because a complete turn is 360&deg; and that brings you back to where you started. So, using inputs to <code>point in direction</code> that are multiples of 360:
                    <span class="katex-block">0,360,720,1080,...</span>
                    will all bring you back to pointing straight up, and similarly, inputs that are, say, 75 more than these:
                    <span class="katex-block">75,75+360,75+720,75+1080,...</span>
                    <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/75-equals-435-mod-360-reporting.png" alt="(75) = ((435) mod (360)) reporting true" title="(75) = ((435) mod (360)) reporting true" />
                    will all do the same thing as <code>point in direction</code> with an input of 75. The mathematical shorthand for this is to say something like "75 is the same as 435 <em>modulo</em> 360, which can be expressed in Snap<em>!</em> as shown at right. (The word modulo was introduced by Gauss as a way to say "except for multiples of." These days, the meaning is often used in other ways, like "The game will take place today, modulo rain.")
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mathematics Note: Circles.</strong> You sometimes hear people say "a circle is a polygon with an infinite number of sides." This isn't true in any precise sense, but it is true that a circle can be <em>approximated</em> by a polygon with many sides, each very short in length. This is similar to what children do when the walk around a circle&mdash;they take many small steps. And this is how Snap<em>!</em> models circles&mdash;it creates a polygon with many small turns and steps. For example:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/circle-script.png" alt="repeat (360) [move (1) steps, turn right (1) degrees]" title="repeat (360) [move (1) steps, turn right (1) degrees]" />
                    <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/circle.png" alt="sprite drawing a circle" title="sprite drawing a circle" /><br />
                    This looks very much like a circle, but it's really a polygon with 360 sides, all of length 1 step.<br />In particular, you can apply facts about circles to these Snap<em>!</em> approximations, and they work quite well. For example, in the Take it Further challenge, the diameter of the red circle is 100. The circumference (perimeter) of a circle is &pi; times its diameter. If your students know this fact, then they can reason that the circumference of the red circle is 100&pi;. Using the approximation 3.14 for &pi;, the circumference is approximately 314. So, if we want to cover this distance in 360 steps, the step size should be <span class="katex">\frac{314}{360}</span>. Snap<em>!</em> can do the calculation for us.<br />
