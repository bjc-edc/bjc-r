            <div>Each assignment is provided as a Google doc that may be shared with students.</div>
            
            <div>Use in:
            <ul>
            <li><a>Lesson 4</a><br />
            	<strong>What is cyberbullying?</strong> <a>Google doc</a><br />
                </li>
            
            <li><a>Lesson 13</a><br />
            	<strong>Is technology good or bad?</strong> <a>Google doc</a><br />
                Technology is not all good or all bad. In this Snap Judgment assignment, look for ways that students use evidence to support claims they make about positive advancements or negative implications of technology. This is not meant to be a polished piece of writing, but should result in students thinking of examples to support their position. In class, they will read pages 13-17 of Blown to Bits which addresses both sides. [Also include link to BDL]</li>
            
            <li><a>Lesson 17</a><br />
            	<strong>Do you think everyone who illegally downloads music or movies deserves to be prosecuted?</strong> <a>Google doc</a><br />
                Students have likely encountered this issue directly in their lives. In this Snap Judgment assignment, students begin to form an argument to support a position. Later in the class, students will receive more information about the issue and engage in a short debate.</li>
                
            <li><a>Lesson 19</a><br />
            	<strong>Should violent video games be sold to minors?</strong> <a>Google doc</a><br />
                This question is the subject of an article that students will read today in class. Students again must construct an argument to support a position. Emphasize the importance of providing reasons and considering counterarguments that might be made by the other side.</li>
