            <h3>Hints</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Find a method for students to submit Snap<em>!</em> projects that makes sense to you. Here's one suggestion: In Snap<em>!</em>, students can choose "Export project..." from the file menu. This brings up text in XML. Students can right-click on the page and "Save As..." to a local folder. Give students directions on naming their files (e.g. Kaleidoscope-first-last.xml), then have them send this file to you. When you go to display their work, you can open Snap<em>!</em>, then choose "Import..." and the file.</li>
