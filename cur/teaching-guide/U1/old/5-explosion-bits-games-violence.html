        <h2>Social Implications Lab 5: Explosion of Bits; Games and Violence</h2>
         <div class="todo">
        	<ul>
                <li>MF: A teacher at the August PD was asking for some kind of written assignment (a docx of prompts or something) to help hold students accountable for their discussions&mdash;so teachers will know that the students are actually having these discussions.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 8/30: The framework for "From NYC teachers in Summer 2015" is there, but no content.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 11/16/15: The pacing times should be changed. I recently completed the "Do violent video games contribute to youth violence?" section and it took about a week. Time was spent on having the students write scripts so they could record their video (to make sure they included evidence). Also class time was used to teach students how to record videos. We used windows movie maker, screen cast o matic, and imovie. Because so much time was invested I decided to continue with the "take it further" activities and had students create their response videos along with a class debate to finalize this section. We began on 11-10 and completed it 11-16.</li>
            </ul>

    	<p>Students begin to see that computing has social implications. The reading in <em>Blown to Bits</em> highlights ways the world has been changed by computing and identifies examples that might not look at first like a "bits story"" but are. In this lab, students get a range of experiences: reading the book, beginning a list of computing innovations, debating the hot topic of how violent video games might (or might not) relate to youth violence, and finding evidence for ways that technology can be both good and bad.</p>
        <p>Activities related to finding and describing computing innovations helps prepare students for the AP Explore Performance Task. The writing and video exercises (such as making a video about an innovation, supporting a claim about privacy using evidence, supporting a claim about video games using evidence, and brainstorming evidence for claims about whether technology is good or bad) also prepare students for the Explore Task.</p>
        <div class="comment">I'm wondering if some/most of this ultimately belongs in the TG Overview not in an individual unit just because it's the first. --MF  PG: You're right that it <em>belongs</em> in the overview, but it is more likely to be <em>seen</em> here.  Maybe both?  Teachers (people in general?) really tend to overlook overviews.</div>
        
        <h4>A few general points about teaching social implications:</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Good discussions require trust. Students won't start out trusting each other or you (but mainly each other). It's vital that you catch any <em>ad hominem</em> argument or verbal bullying, make everyone stop talking, and quietly but clearly make it clear that you won't allow personal attacks.</li>
                <li>Conventional wisdom says that teachers should not express their own opinions. That's not necessarily right. You generally shouldn't <em>start</em> with your own opinion, or use your position of authority as teacher to imply that it's the "right" one, but if everyone in the class seems to take the opposite position, it's beneficial for you to weigh in, as long as you hold yourself to the same standard of evidence you expect from students, and as long as you convince them that their grade doesn't depend on agreeing with you. (For this reason, you should present your grading policy early, perhaps online.) Certainly you shouldn't pretend not to have opinions. Your total honesty will help build trust.</li>
                <li>Most issues appear at first to have two possible answers, in direct opposition. Usually neither of those initial answers is satisfactory, but neither is labeling the question unanswerable. Look for third positions, not a "compromise" but a genuinely different way of thinking. As one example, the issue of copyright initially presents itself as "information wants to be free" versus "copying is theft," but any useful resolution has to start by noting that the interests of publishing companies (record labels, movie studios, etc.) are very different from the interests of creators (musicians, etc.). Maybe we need a solution that protects musicians, but we don't need a solution that protects record labels. Also, the badly-named "copyright" is not a <em>right</em> the way freedom of speech is a right. It is a <em>limited-time</em> legal monopoly, given to creators as part of a bargain through which their creations eventually enter the public domain. Does all that make illegal downloading okay? That's a hard question, not an obvious one.</li>
                <li>Make sure students understand that the social implications of technology are not all bad! None of us wants to live in a world without antibiotics. But the good social implications generally take care of themselves, whereas the bad ones require social action, redesign of the technology, research, and deep understanding.</li>
                <li>"Everyone has the right to their opinion" is both true and false. It's true in the sense that nobody should be <em>punished</em> for their opinions (in class or in the world). But not all opinions are equally worthy; the persuasive ones are backed up with research and evidence.</li>
                <li>Start with Computing in the News as often as possible. Always bring in two stories, one about a wonderful advance in technology, and one about a social problem related to technology. If possible, after the first few examples, make <em>students</em> responsible for bringing in the two stories. Rotate through all the students if possible. Generally the stories will be presented quickly and not discussed; the opener shouldn't take over the entire class. But if a particular story really resonates with the students, you might ditch the lesson plan in favor of a longer discussion.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Prepare</h3>
        <div>
            <div class="comment">GH Feedback 8/30: The framework for "From NYC teachers in Summer 2015" is there, but no content.<ul><li>I commented it out. --MF</li></ul></div>
            <div class="sidenote">Past teachers have come up with potential reading questions and prompts about <em>Blown to Bits</em>:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://tinyurl.com/supd-2014-reading" target="_blank">Summer 2014</a></li>
                    <!--<li><a href="http://tinyurl.com/bjc4nyc-2015-reading" target="_blank">From NYC teachers in Summer 2015</a></li>-->
                </ul>
            </div>
        	<div class="sidenote">Options for students to access <em>Blown to Bits</em> include reading it as an <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter1.pdf" target="_blank">online PDF</a>, purchasing hard copies of the book, or photocopying pages so students can make annotations as they read.</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Review the <a href="https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf#page=79" target="_blank">CSP Explore task</a> specification. Its requirements are pretty narrow (e.g., students must discuss how a chosen innovation uses data, and must prepare both a paper and a multimedia presentation). We certainly want to prepare students for this requirement, but our aims are broader; we want them to develop the intellectual tools to understand technology and society more deeply.</li>
                <li>Several activities in this lab ask students to make videos. Be sure to know your school's policy on publication of images of students; you may have to warn students not to post their videos on social media, or alternatively to make videos in which they do not appear onscreen.</li>
                <li>If you haven't yet, make sure you use <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-teaching-guide.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016_teacher.html&novideo&noassignment">Computing in the News</a> as an opener this week.</li>
                <li>Think about how you want students to interact with computers and each other this week. Students will need to be on the computer at times to do some online research. You may choose to print out <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">Chapter 1 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a> so that students can annotate as they read. Students will also engage in discussion with each other, so think of a way to arrange your space so students can have eye contact with each other.</li>
                <li>Review all lab activities, especially the debate activities included with Do violent video games contribute to youth violence? (<a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Skill-5-Counterargument-DRMO-One-Pager.docx" target="_blank">making counterarguments</a>) and Is technology good or bad?

        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
		<div>
            <ul>
                <li>
					<strong>Page 1: You and Technology.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Depending on your class, you might have students share their "technology autobiographies" with each other.</li>
                        <div class="sidenote"> Creativity is one of the Big Ideas of the course</div>
                        <li>In particular, listen for students who describe ways they use technology to <em>create</em>. If students don't identify this now, we hope they do by the end of the year.</li>
                        <li>The kind of interaction with technology that will be most obvious to students is initiated by the student him/herself. Be sure that the discussion also includes ways in which they are affected by technology used by others. This doesn't have to mean affected <em>badly;</em> for example, the odds are that your school uses computers in the process of scheduling students into classes. A visit to the doctor might involve x-rays or blood tests. A third category of interaction isn't about the individual student, but about technology's effects on society in general, such as industrial pollution (bad) and safety improvements such as antilock brakes (good).</li>
                        <li>Also listen for the adjectives students use to describe their relationship with technology. One of the goals of the course is that, by the end, students will identify themselves as belonging in the world of computer science. Students' sense of identity and agency will ideally change as they see themselves as producers, and not just consumers, of technology.</li>
                        <li>The point of the Take It Further activity is to make the point that technology has been around, and having social implications, since the beginning of human history. Also, technology appears in non-obvious forms: even the fresh banana is now a product of factory farming techniques, pesticides, and so on.</li>
                        <li>In Take It Further problem A, they're all technology; the banana is almost certainly grown in a human-planted banana plantation and gets to your grocery through a transportation network.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
					<strong>Page 2: Computing Innovations.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The repeated use of the word "innovation" on this page is a nod to the AP Explore task. Really, of course, every technology is an innovation at some point, and its social implications don't disappear when it stops feeling like the latest thing.</li>
                        <li>For a fast-paced brainstorming activity (problem 1), pass out several whiteboard markers at a time and have students put ideas on the board and pass the markers to each other.</li>
                        <li>Take a picture of the board or otherwise record the responses (such as in a class-wide Google doc). Throughout the year, build on this list as a resource for students for when they choose an innovation to write about for the AP Explore Performance Task.</li>
                        <li>Take It Further: The technology you use to make videos will depend on what is available to you. Students might capture videos on their phones (this can be assigned for homework if they are not allowed to use phones in the school) or use software like iMovie or <a href="http://screencast-o-matic.com" target="_blank">Screencast-o-matic</a>.</li>

					<strong>Page 3: Tanya Rider's Story.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Much of <em>Blown to Bits</em> has to do with the balance between the abundance of digital information and our attempts for retaining privacy and ownership of our own information. After students read the selection, discuss briefly. Students may also be interested in looking up news stories or videos about Tanya Rider.</li>
                        <li>On the other hand, don't let the discussion be entirely about the exciting details of her narrow escape. The reason the authors of <em>Blown to Bits</em> chose this story to start the book is that it makes us think twice about the goal of privacy that otherwise pervades the book and most discussions of social implications. It was the protection of Ms. Rider's privacy that almost cost her life. The Take It Further activity on this page tries to push students toward a nuanced, dialectical understanding of the privacy issue: neither a simplistic embracing of personal privacy nor a complete rejection of privacy as a goal will do.</li>
						<li>In Take It Further problem A, there are many possibilities.  How about if the cell phone company was allowed to tell the Red Cross where the missing person's cell phone is?  Or the Fire Department?  How about if the rule were different for a moving cell phone in a city vs, a stationary cell phone in the middle of nowhere?</li>

                        <!--Opener &mdash; <strong>Snap Judgment: Should violent video games be sold to minors?</strong> <br />-->
                        This question is the subject of an article that students will read today in class. Students again must construct an argument to support a position. Emphasize the importance of providing reasons and considering counterarguments that might be made by the other side.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Here's a little background for you about this issue: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>There have been several attempts to prohibit violent video games; so far, in the US, all have been overturned on free speech grounds.</li>
                                <li>A substantial body of research seems to indicate that children's play is more <em>aggressive</em> shortly after playing violent video games. There is no strong evidence linking video games to actual <em>violence</em> in children. (People argue about the meaning of these words. If a child shoves another child, is that consensual aggressive role-playing, or violence?)</li>
                                <li>In the popular press, the issue is often discussed not on the basis of research but in response to specific examples: Someone shoots up a school, and he turns out to have played video games. Of course there is no evidence of a causal relationship in these stories.</li>
                                <li>A related issue, not specifically about technology, is that there has been a wave of overreactions to horrific violent incidents, e.g., a seven-year-old <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/03/02/7-year-old-boy-reportedly-suspended-after-making-a-gun-out-of-a-pastry-at-school/" target="_blank">suspended from school</a> for molding a breakfast pastry into the shape of a gun. It's hard to ask students to discuss the issue of violence calmly when adults can't! But try.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Let students know that they will have the opportunity to examine evidence from both sides of the debate. To open the activity, consider having students place themselves along a continuum in the room. Call one side of your classroom "strongly agree" and the other side "strongly disagree" and have students stand in a line according to their current view on whether violent video games contribute to youth violence.
                            <ul>
                            	<li>Students are expressing their opinion and there may be disagreements. Tell students that they will get a chance to examine these views more in depth today and that it is quite possible for opinions to change based on learning more evidence. Also, there are many reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with this statement, and it is important that the classroom will be a safe place to consider evidence from both sides thoughtfully.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <div class="sidenote">The emphasis of this activity is to identify <em>evidence</em> to back up a claim.</div>
                        <li>Depending on your students, you might randomly assign students to either pro or con (e.g., by flipping a coin), have them skim through the evidence and decide for themselves, or assign them the opposite view from what they expressed when they stood on the continuum. Give students 15-20 minutes to read through the information presented on the websites (and do their own research, if they wish) about their side and identify three pieces of evidence they find most convincing.</li>
                        <li>Have students trade papers with a partner and read each others' three pieces of evidence. Students may discuss further in pairs, small groups, or as a class.</li>
                        <li>As time permits, do the other activities on the student page (explain data, make a video, make a video of a counterargument). If you don't have time to make videos, you might still do an activity around counterarguments. For example, use the <a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Activity-10-Skill-4-Counterargument-Class-Challenge.docx" target="_blank">Counterargument Class Challenge template</a> from the Boston Debate League.</li>

					<strong>Page 5: Is technology good or bad?</strong>

                        Opener &mdash; <strong>Snap Judgment: Is technology good or bad?</strong> <br />
                        Technology is not all good or all bad. In this Snap Judgment assignment, look for ways that students use evidence to support claims they make about positive advancements or negative implications of technology. This is not meant to be a polished piece of writing but should result in students thinking of examples to support their position. In class, they will read pages 13-17 of Blown to Bits which addresses both sides.
                        </li>-->
                        <li>The <a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Brainstorm-Game-Narrative.pdf" target="_blank">Brainstorm Game</a> is another teaching resource from the Boston Debate League. You can choose to play this as a game or simply present this as a writing/discussion activity.</li>
                        <li>After reading the last section of Chapter 1 of <em>Blown to Bits</em>, have a class discussion about how technology can be both good and bad. Students can also share about their computing innovation as an example of a technology that can help and hurt.</li>
                        <li>Take It Further: If you do this section, have students in small groups read about just <em>one</em> of the Koans and prepare to teach the rest of the class about what they read.</li>
                        <li>
							Of course this is a trick question. Both technology in general, and any particular technology, are good <em>and</em> bad. The point of this activity is for students to understand that, but not therefore to give up on an insightful position.
							<ul>
								<li>There is an academic field called Technology and Society, in which the central question is whether technology controls social change, or society determines technological change. Of course there are good examples both ways. This might be an interesting question to raise in class, because one possible answer to the good-or-bad question is that technology itself is morally neutral, and that <em>people</em> are responsible for any good or bad effects. The "guns don't kill people; people kill people" slogan of gun manufacturers is an example of this position. Students who are attracted to the general idea that technology is neutral might or might not feel differently about the case of guns, especially because the advertising of that slogan is so obviously self-serving.</li>
								<li>We want students to end up understanding that the social impact of a technology depends on specific decisions made by designers and implementors of the technology. Google could have decided to make money by charging for searches, rather than by selling advertising. Encryption could have been built into the Internet from the beginning. New technologies are not <em>necessarily</em> a Faustian bargain.</li>
