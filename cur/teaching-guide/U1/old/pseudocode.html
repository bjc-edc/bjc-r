					In this lab, there are a couple of handwavy algorithm descriptions looking like this:<br /><br />

                    Please avoid describing this as "pseudocode," and <em>definitely </em>don't ask students to write pseudocode! We use these code descriptions <em>sparingly</em> as a pedagogic tool when we want to avoid telling students exactly how to code something, not because we think programmers should write things like this. "Pseudocode" is used by people who have to cope with terrible programming languages that are so loaded with syntax that actual code is unreadable. There's nothing beautiful or joyful about it.</li>
