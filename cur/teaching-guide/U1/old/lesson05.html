		<h3>Opener</h3>
            <div>Aww, Snap!: <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/TG/aww-snap/forever.html">Moving forever</a><br />
			Students reason through code without the use of a computer. The code includes bugs for students to resolve.</div>
            
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <div class="sidenote"><strong>Looking ahead</strong><br />Next week students will form groups of 2-3, choose a computing innovation that interests them, and produce a short video that explains the innovation and some of its impacts. Eventually, students will use this experience to help them with their AP CS Principles Explore Task, about implications of computing innovations.</div>
        <p>Look through these lists of recent innovations:
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/a-world-transformed-what-are-the-top-30-innovations-of-the-last-30-years/">Wharton's top 30 innovations</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/12/tech/cnn10-ideas/?hpt=hp_t1">CNN's 10 ideas</a></li>
        </ul>
        Not all of these are computing innovations, but many are related to computing.</p>
        <p><strong>Guiding Question</strong>: Which of these innovations are you familiar with? Look up a few innovations that you are unfamiliar with to see what they do, what they are used for, and what kind of impact they have on the way we live.</p>
        <p>Note: You might encourage students to start their own Google doc to keep track of their findings. As they look up information online, encourage them to be in the habit of keeping track of and citing their sources.</p>
        
        <h3>Share</h3>
        <p>Students sumbitted their Kaleidoscopes at the end of <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/old/lesson03.html">Lesson 3</a>. Choose interesting examples to show the class and ask the class for their reactions. There are several ways you might structure this time:
        <ul>
        	<li>If many students struggled to get their Kaleidoscope to work, it might be useful to share several examples of students who got parts of the program correct, and then talk what they might try next.</li>
            <li>You might choose to share different solution approaches. For example, students might have found different ways to modify each sprite's <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-0-0.png" class="block" alt="Go to X Y Block"/> block, and students can see how different expressions resulted in similar results.</li>
            <li>You might have some students who got particularly creative with their Kaleidoscopes. Perhaps they had more than four sprites, or played with having the sprites move at different angles, or made other creative modifications. Creativity is a Big Idea of AP CS Principles, and you might emphasize this creative spirit during this sharing time.</li>
            <li>You can also invite students to volunteer to present their own projects, though in general it is better to be guided by a specific purpose. If asking for volunteers, so so at the end of the sharing time to give the opportunity to those who haven't yet seen their work displayed.</li>
