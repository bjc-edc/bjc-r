        <h2>Programming Lab 3: Building Your Own Blocks</h2>
        <p>So far, students have used blocks that already exist in Snap<em>!</em>: <code>move</code>, <code>repeat</code>, <code>turn</code>, <code>set pen color</code>, and so on. In this lab, students get their first experience with abstraction as they learn to create their own blocks to perform new actions. They add input variables to their blocks and learn how to use those inputs to let their blocks perform more flexibly. They use their own blocks, just as they've used the built-in blocks, to build yet other blocks. And they learn a new control structure, the <code>for</code> loop, a new experience with using variables. </p>
        <p>Defining a block and then using that block within another definition prepares students for the powerful idea of recursion, defining a block and using it within <em>itself</em>, which will be addressed in <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/6-recursion-trees-fractals.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 6: Recursion</a> and <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/7-recursive-reporters.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 7: Recursive Reporters</a>. </p>

					<strong>Page 1: Designing Custom Blocks.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>A common slip, even among experienced <span class="snap">snap</span> programmers, is to forget to choose a palette/color when making a new block. The block ends up in the gray "Other" category. This doesn't hurt anything, but makes the block hard to find because gray blocks share a palette with Variables. To change a block's palette, edit it and click on the yellow hat block at the top of its script in the editor.</li>
		                <li>It's also possible to change the <em>shape</em> of a custom block in the block editor, but only if  the block is not currently used in a script or another block and as long as it doesn't even appear in the scripting area. You must delete all such invocations (by dragging them onto the palette area) before clicking on the hat block.</li>
                        <div class="comment">I wonder about the effectiveness of this message since the error messages in Snap<em>!</em> are not especially helpful... --MF</div>
                        <li><strong>Debugging</strong>: Beginning programmers sometimes treat unexpected results and error messages as signs of failure. The right way to look at them is that they're information that help you take a next step. Instead of seeing the program as "no good," see it as "not yet done." Creating bugs, even often, is not a sign that you are no good at programming! Bugs are normal, especially as programs become more complex. And, sometimes, bugs (and error messages) provide not only clues about how to fix the program, but ideas that can be <em>useful</em> in new programs. Experienced programmers can find bugs amusing (except when there's a deadline!) and error messages very helpful.</li>

                        <li><strong>Mathematics Notes: Polygons.</strong> The <code>draw polygon</code> problem in the Take It Further on the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-building-blocks/2-adding-an-input.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Adding an Input</a> page is important; you might want to assign it to everyone or work on it as a class. It introduces the idea of <em>generalizing patterns:</em> if you have a family of custom blocks that are mostly the same script but with a little difference in each one, you can make a single block that captures the entire family by adding an input for the part that's different. We'll use this idea many times in the course, but it's especially important in Unit 6 when the result of the generalization is a recursive procedure.</li>
                        <li>Custom blocks that your students create on this page will have rectangular input slots, not oval as in the primitive (built-in) blocks, for numeric inputs. If students ask why, say that this won't affect the usability of their blocks, and that they will learn to distinguish input types in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/old-tools-techniques/3-input-types.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 2, Lab 3</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mathematics Notes: Angles.</strong> High school geometry is not prerequisite to BJC, but students who have had it may be able to share their knowledge about working with measuring angles with degrees. <em>A common misunderstanding about drawing polygons is to confuse the interior angles of the figure with the angles of sprite rotation</em>. These are not generally the same<!--; they are, in fact, supplementary-->. To clarify the distinction, have students draw sketches with marked angles. Don't make it a discussion about math <em>vocabulary;</em> focus students' attention on the angle of the sprite's turning. Draw a big equilateral triangle (on the floor if possible), and get one or more students to "play sprite," tracing the picture by moving and turning, and ask them to pay attention to what the sprites (i.e., their bodies) are doing. "Did you turn more or less than a right angle?" If that doesn't clear up the confusion, trace (in chalk) the kid's foot before and after a turn, and get the kid to draw the arc between the two feet.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Mathematics Notes: Direction.</strong><a name="direction" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>People sometimes wonder about <em>the use of compass directions rather than Cartesian directions</em>. Here's some history:
                            <ul>
                                <li>This tradition started in Logo in the 1980s and was inherited by Scratch, then by <span class="snap">snap</span>.</li>
                                <li>In Logo, the turtle had the arrowhead shape that's our default, and  pointed up by default. This is the right thing for fractal trees, and as good as anything for other turtle geometry exercises like the ones in BJC.</li>
                                <li>Scratch shifted the focus from turtle graphics to animation of characters, so sprites have costumes, such as their trademark cat, that move mostly horizontally. So they ended up with Logo's compass directions, but with a default direction of East (90 degrees).</li>
                                <li>The choice of direction measure in Snap<em>!</em> is motivated mostly by the desire to be compatible with Scratch, so that we have access to their 10 million uploaded projects.</li>
                            </ul>
                            For teachers who want to use Snap<em>!</em> in teaching mathematics, it's easy enough to build your own angle blocks:<br />

                            You can even convert to/from radians if you prefer.
