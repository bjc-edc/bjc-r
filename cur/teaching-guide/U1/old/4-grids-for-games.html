        <h2>Programming Lab 4: Building Grids for Games</h2>
		<p>Students begin a project—building a Tic Tac Toe game and other games that are played by placing marks (X or O, or a number) on a square array of tiles. This project will develop over the course of a few units. In this lab, students get as far as creating the grid, getting it automatically to fit the screen regardless of the number of tiles, and placing marks on the grid (but not yet with the computer checking to see if the moves are legal or if a player has won). In doing this, students continue to use ideas (and new levels) of abstraction, and learn also how to use a variety of math reporters—four basic operations (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>×</code>, <code>÷</code>), and <code>mod</code>&mdash;to create new reporter blocks, <em>functions</em> to perform specialized calculations for them.</p>

        <h3>Pacing:</h3>

        	<ul>
                <li><strong>This is another lab that we recommend doing yourself before class.</strong> The mathematics of the boardgame is not difficult, but it may require some clever thinking to determine how to use the variables available to position the sprite correctly regardless of the variables' values. </li>
        	</ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Students will:</h3>
       	<div>
            <ul>
                <!--<li>Formalize their language and understanding of several different types of blocks in <span class="snap">snap</span>.</li>-->
                <li>Broaden and refine their understanding of the mathematics of computer science including basic arithmetic operations, the <code>round</code> block, the <code>mod</code> block, the <code>random</code> block, and logical operators.</li>
                <li>Analyze code with nested operations.</li>
				<li>Build tools that anticipate a variety of games: tic-tac-toe, magic-square games, and others. More powerful programming techniques&mdash;particularly <strong>lists</strong> which are the major new programming idea in Unit 3&mdash;are useful in completing these games.</li>

        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
					<strong>Page 1: Building Tic Tac Toe and Other Board Games.</strong>
					<ul>
                        <li>This is the most complicated project in Unit 1, but students are given enough subtasks to make it likely that, <em>working together</em>, they can succeed. Working together is key. Some will figure out how to solve certain parts, and others will figure out how to solve other parts. Sharing, they will learn from each other.</li>
                        <li>
                            <em>What do I do when a student asks how to solve a problem?</em> There will almost certainly be parts of some of these projects that <em>you</em> don't quickly see how to do. But even when you <em>do</em> know how to solve the problem, the most useful answer you can give is often one of these:
                            <ul> 
                                <li>Show me what you've already figured out.</li>
                                <li>What are the <em>parts</em> of the problem that need to be built? </li>
                                <li>Is there a good starting place (or a thing to do next), something really simple that will get us a bit closer?</li>
                            </ul>
						</li>
						<li>To avoid overloading the text, the orange box about abstraction doesn't mention that even building the board out of boxes is an abstraction-based design decision. That's not how you draw a tic-tac-toe board by hand; you draw long intersecting lines. We could have done that here, too, but wanted a <code>draw tile</code> block that could be modified later.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mathematics Note: State invariance.</strong> Drawing a row of tiles requires that students build in instructions to move the sprite to "the next" position. That's because the typical routine for drawing a square, "<code>repeat (4) [move (100), turn (90)]</code>" puts the sprite back in its original position&mdash;the script is <em>state invariant</em>. Building state invariance into scripts and blocks is a good idea, because it makes "ending where you stated" makes it easier to problematically move the sprite to the next state.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
                <li>
					<strong>Page 2: Expressions and Operations.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Remind students that they can run scripts by clicking on them. Reporters that stand alone (not inside another block) report their result in a speech balloon next to the block.</li>
                        <li>Discuss the new mathematics and create scripts to review what students are learning.</li>
                        <li>
							Some <strong>vocabulary</strong> (for <em>you</em> to use in context,  not to require of students):
                            <ul>
                                <li>A <em>command</em> is a single Lego-brick-shaped block, without its inputs.</li>
                                <li>A <em>reporter</em> is a single oval-shaped block, without its inputs.</li>
                                <li>A <em>predicate</em> is a single hexagonal block, without its inputs.</li>
                                <li>An <em>instruction</em> is a command block along with its input expressions.</li>
                                <li>An <em>expression</em> is a reporter block along with its input expressions.</li>
                                <li>A <em>Boolean expression</em> is a predicate block along with its input expressions.</li>
                                <li>A <em>Boolean value</em> is <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true"> or <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false">. (Not the text strings "true" and "false"; not 0 and 1.)</li>
                            </ul>
                            So a reporter or a predicate is a function; an expression is a function applied to arguments.
                        </li>
                        <li>
							<strong>Mathematics Note: Order of Operations.</strong> There's no need to teach "order of operations." Nesting the operations does the work for you&mdash;it's like automatic parenthesization. For example:
                            <span class="katex-block">\frac{4}{7+(3\times2)}</span>
                            <p class="center">is <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/4÷(7+(3x2)).png" alt="4 / (7 + (3 x 2))" title="4 / (7 + (3 x 2))" />and</p>
                            <span class="katex-block">\frac{4}{7} + (3 \times 2)</span>
                            <p class="center">is <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/(4÷7)+(3x2).png" alt="(4 / 7) + (3 x 2)" title="(4 / 7) + (3 x 2)" /></p>
						</li>
                        <li><strong>Mathematics Note: Rounding.</strong> The round block reports the closest integer to its input. If there's a tie (like with 3.5), it rounds up, so that <code>round (3.5)</code> reports 4.</li>
                        <li>
                        	<p><strong>Mathematics Note: <code>Mod</code>.</strong><a name="mod" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>The <code>mod</code> block returns the remainder when the first input is divided by the second.</p>
                            <p>
                                For positive whole numbers, this is the same as the notion of remainder that students learn in elementary school when they learn to divide one whole number by another. So:<br />
                                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/7mod5reporting2.png" alt="7 mod 5 reporting 2" title="7 mod 5 reporting 2" /><br />
                                because when 7 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2 (and the quotient is 1).

                            	The behavior of the <code>mod</code> block may seem mysterious when one or both of the inputs are negative integers. For example:<br />
                                <!--<span class="katex-block">mod (7, 5) = 2</span>
                                <span class="katex-block">mod (-7, 5) = 3</span>
                                <span class="katex-block">mod (-7, -5) = -2</span>
                                <span class="katex-block">mod (7, -5) = -3</span>-->

								The sign of the output of <code>mod</code> agrees with the sign of its second input. But why?
                            </p>
                            <p>Let's go back to positive whole numbers for a moment. The fact that <code>mod (7, 5) = 2</code> comes from <span class="katex">7 \div 5 = 1 \text{ remainder } 2</span>, which comes from <span class="katex">7 = 5 \times 1 + 2</span> where 1 is the <em>quotient</em> and 2 is the <em>remainder</em>. The quotient is the key to the mystery.</p>
                            <p>
                            	In Snap<em>!</em>, you can get the quotient by dividing 7 by 5 to get 1.4 and then <em>rounding down</em>. This operation of rounding down is called <code>floor</code>, and it's built into Snap<em>!</em> (you can find it as a drop-down option in the <code>sqrt</code> block in the Operators pallete). For any real number, <code>floor</code> takes the closest integer to the left on the number line (hence the name "floor").<br />
                            	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/floor7div5reporting1.png" alt="floor (7 ÷ 5) reporting 1" title="floor (7 ÷ 5) reporting 1" />
                            </p>
							<p>So, given any two integers <span class="katex">a</span> and <span class="katex">b</span> (or real numbers, really) you can calculate the quotient <span class="katex">\frac{b}{a}</span> and then the floor of their quotient <span class="katex">\text{floor}(\frac{b}{a})</span>. Let's call this quotient <span class="katex">q</span>. Then, <span class="katex">b</span> will equal <span class="katex">aq</span> plus the little left over that we lost by using floor (the remainder, which we'll call <span class="katex">r</span>). So now, <span class="katex">b = aq + r</span> much like <span class="katex">7 = 5 \times 1 + 2</span>.</p>
                            <p>That remainder is what Snap<em>!</em> and most programming languages report for <code>mod(b, a)</code> and this explains the signs of the outputs when one or both inputs are negative.</p>
