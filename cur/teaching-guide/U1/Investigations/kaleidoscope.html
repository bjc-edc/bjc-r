		<div class="todo">Needs work still... --MMF</div>
        <p>Students become acquainted with the <span class="snap">snap</span> stage as a coordinate plane.</p> 
        

        <!--<h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </div>-->


        <h3>Students will:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice pair programming</li>
                <li>Incorporate x- and y-positions in their scripts</li>
                <li>Explore and use <code>forever</code></li>
            </ul>
        </div> 

        
        <h3>During this lab, look for:</h3>
        <div>
        	<ul>
            	<li>Students may notice that when you drag a block into another block of the same category, the coloring changes to alternate between light and dark versions of the block color (aka "zebra coloring").</li>
                <li>After students make a Kaleidoscope, there is a section called "Take It Further." These sections (in purple) are <em>optional</em> for students, in that they can proceed to future labs without having completed these problems. "Take It Further" problems are interesting extensions on problems students have seen; some have an increased level of difficulty, while others do not. These problems offer some differentiation support, in that students who finish the required elements earlier have additional problems to try. However, these problems are not provided merely to be "more stuff to do" but to convey to students that there are many creative ways to apply what they're learning, and they are certainly encouraged to continue exploring beyond any given assignment.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
            
        
        <h3>Share</h3>
        <div>
        	Students sumbitted their Kaleidoscopes at the end of <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/old/lesson03.html">Lesson 3</a>. Choose interesting examples to show the class and ask the class for their reactions. There are several ways you might structure this time:
            <ul>
                <li>If many students struggled to get their Kaleidoscope to work, it might be useful to share several examples of students who got parts of the program correct, and then talk what they might try next.</li>
                <li>You might choose to share different solution approaches. For example, students might have found different ways to modify each sprite's <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-0-0.png" class="block" alt="Go to X Y Block"/> block, and students can see how different expressions resulted in similar results.</li>
                <li>You might have some students who got particularly creative with their Kaleidoscopes. Perhaps they had more than four sprites, or played with having the sprites move at different angles, or made other creative modifications. Creativity is a Big Idea of AP CS Principles, and you might emphasize this creative spirit during this sharing time.</li>
                <li>You can also invite students to volunteer to present their own projects, though in general it is better to be guided by a specific purpose. If asking for volunteers, so so at the end of the sharing time to give the opportunity to those who haven't yet seen their work displayed.</li> 
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h3>Other stuff</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    As students finish making their Kaleidoscope program, they should save their work and submit it. It is up to you whether you want to assign grades for this work, but at the very least, you will use their submitted work during <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/old/lesson05.html">Lesson 5</a> during a sharing session that gives students an opportunity to see each others' work. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Before class, find a method for students to submit <span class="snap">snap</span> projects that makes sense to you. Here's one suggestion: In <span class="snap">snap</span>, students can choose "Export project..." from the file menu. This brings up text in XML. Students can right-click on the page and "Save As..." to a local folder. Give students directions on naming their files (e.g. Kaleidoscope-first-last.xml), then have them send this file to you. When you go to display their work, you can open <span class="snap">snap</span>, then choose "Import..." and the file.</li>
                        <li>During class, take note of interesting approaches or creative ideas that would be interesting to share. As you will see, it's difficult to "browse" through projects from the .xml files, so it's good to have a sense of whose projects you'd like to share. Consider also asking students to submit yet-incomplete kaleidoscopes (give them some way of indicating this in the file name) if you see an interesting intermediate attempt that would spark discussion.</li>
