    	<h2>Programming Lab 2: Control Commands</h2>
	    <p>Students become acquainted with the <span class="snap">snap</span> stage as a coordinate plane.</p> 

		<h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
        	<ul>
        		<li><s>Look through students' posted Kaleidoscope projects and think of the projects you would like to have students see.</s></li>
                <li>Prepare a <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/TG/computing-in-the-news.html">Computing in the News</a> story.</li>
            	<li>Make sure students know the procedure for doing their homework and turning it in, especially if they will do this assignment online.</li>
	        </ul>

        <h3>Students will:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice pair programming</li>
                <li>Incorporate x- and y-positions in their scripts</li>
                <li>Explore and use <code>forever</code></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
