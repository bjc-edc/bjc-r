        <h2>Week 1 Assignments</h2>    
        <div class="todo">Add some "Paper and pencil programming problems" JK: If you want to give any homework that's programming-related to kids who don't have access to computers, they would need to be paper and pencil problems. So I was thinking we might (in an ideal world, or maybe just a future world) provide one worksheet/assignment option as homework per week.</div>
        <p>
	        Optional assignments for class discussion, silent work, or homework (for use anytime during or after the indicated lab):
            <ul>
                <li><strong><a href="http://bjc.edc.org/hourofcode/index.html" target="_blank">BJC Hour of Code</a></strong> (Consider assigning even before school starts.)</li>                
                <li>
                	Writing Prompts:
                    <ul>
	               		<div class="sidenote">If you assign this writing prompt, collect and scan/photocopy the responses to use at the very beginning of Lab 5.</div>
                    	<li><strong>How do you interact with computers and digital media?</strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oboPDqZ9cNtJ_3fIFVPkfKAPPQkHo7TSKSULbB1CjgA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">This initial writing assignment</a> can help you gauge both students' writing abilities and familiarity with computers. This is also their first assignment on Google docs, so you can go over the mechanics of accessing their assignment. This assignment can also be completed offline for those without the necessary access at home. (Lab 1)</li>
	                	<li>Consider assigning some of the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/Week01/activities.html#discussion" target="_blank">Week 1 discussion prompts</a> as writing prompts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
				<li><strong><a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/investigations/kaleidoscope.html" target="_blank">Kaleidoscope</a> Investigation</strong> (Lab 2)</li>
                <li><a name="megacrayons" class="anchor"></a><strong>Mega-Crayons</strong>, a simpler adaptation to the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/7-projects/make-a-kaleidoscope.html" target="_blank">Kaleidoscope</a> investigation,  in which students draw with multiple, multi-colored sprites at once according to the location of the mouse. In a Mega Crayons program, the mimicking sprites are only translated (offset), not reflected, so the mathematics might be more accessible to some students. (Lab 2)</li>
                <li>
                	Other Games: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YXwcx0rSlY" target="_blank">Maze</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKBrDRxH1TQ" target="_blank">Asteroids</a>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>These videos are designed for Scratch, not Snap<em>!</em>, but the two are similar, and students will likely be able to develop these two apps using Snap<em>!</em> early in the course. (Be sure students do use Snap<em>!</em>)</li>
                    
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    You may wish to specifically assign one or more of the optional "Take it Further" problems:
