        <h2>Week 1 Assignments</h2>    
        <p>
	        Optional assignments for class discussion, silent work, or homework (for use anytime during or after the indicated lab):
            <ul>
                <li><strong><a href="http://bjc.edc.org/hourofcode/index.html" target="_blank">BJC Hour of Code</a></strong> (Consider assigning even before school starts.)</li>
                
                <li>
                	Writing Prompts:
                    <ul>
	               		<div class="sidenote">If you assign this writing prompt, collect and scan/photocopy the responses to use at the very beginning of Lab 5.</div>
                    	<li><strong>How do you interact with computers and digital media?</strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oboPDqZ9cNtJ_3fIFVPkfKAPPQkHo7TSKSULbB1CjgA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">This initial writing assignment</a> can help you gauge both students' writing abilities and familiarity with computers. This is also their first assignment on Google docs, so you can go over the mechanics of accessing their assignment. This assignment can also be completed offline for those without the necessary access at home. (Lab 1)</li>
	                	<li>Consider assigning some of the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/Week01/activities.html#discussion" target="_blank">Week 1 discussion prompts</a> as writing prompts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <div class="comment">Not sure what this is: "Paper and pencil programming problems link" Anyone? -MF JK: If you want to give any homework that's programming-related to kids who don't have access to computers, they would need to be paper and pencil problems. So I was thinking we might (in an ideal world, or maybe just a future world) provide one worksheet/assignment option as homework per week.</div>
				<li>
                	<strong><a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/investigations/kaleidoscope.html" target="_blank">Kaleidoscope</a> Investigation</strong> (Lab 2)
                    <ul>
                    	<li>You might encourage students who finish this project early to vary their kaleidoscope by using <em>different transformations of the coordinates</em> and/or by <em>using more sprites</em>.</li>
                        <li>Or, instead of following the coordinates of the mouse, students could make sprites point toward each other and chase each other by moving a short distance (and possibly also turning, as well, so that they don't instantly crash).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mega-Crayons</strong>, a simpler adaptation to the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/6-projects/make-a-kaleidoscope.html" target="_blank">Kaleidoscope</a> investigation,  in which students draw with multiple, multi-colored sprites at once according to the location of the mouse. In a Mega Crayons program, the mimicking sprites are only translated (offset), not reflected, so the mathematics might be more accessible to some students. (Lab 2)</li>
                <li>
                    You may wish to specifically assign one or more of the optional "Take it Further" problems:
