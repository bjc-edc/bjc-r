    	<h2>Programming Lab 1: Introduction</h2>
        <p>Students go right into working with <span class="snap">snap</span> in the very first class. As you take care of mandatory first-day business, make sure to leave students 30-40 minutes to explore the hour of code projects in pairs. In Lab 1, students explore block programming with a simple script to draw a square, set up their <span class="snap">snap</span> accounts for saving projects, build a video game, and get to know the <span class="snap">snap</span> stage as a coordinate plane.</p>
		<p>As the year begins, it is important that students know what is expected of them. Labs are intended to be times during which students work at their own pace in pairs. They should know that they are responsible for getting through the material in the section, but that they are also free to explore and create if something of interest to them. Occasionally, there are prompts in the labs directing students to post their work, whether it be to a Google classroom feed, Piazza, or some other platform. Allow time for the students (and yourself) to get used to the technology. Expect glitches, and also model the necessary patience and perseverance necessary to work with new technology.</p> 

        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 5 lab pages could be split across two or three days. Expected times to complete follow: <ul>
                <li>15-20 minutes on Exploring <span class="snap">snap</span> Code</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on <span class="snap">snap</span> Accounts and Files</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Looks and Sound</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Sprite Position and Direction</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Getting to Know the <span class="snap">snap</span> Interface</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><ul>
        	<div class="comment">Brian (or anyone), is there (or can you suggest) a more specific strategy for this? -MF</div>
            <li><strong>Saving, Submitting, and Sharing Projects in <span class="snap">snap</span></strong> Find a method for students to submit <span class="snap">snap</span> projects that makes sense to you. Here's one suggestion: In <span class="snap">snap</span>, students can choose "Export project..." from the file menu. This brings up text in XML. Students can right-click on the page and "Save As..." to a local folder. Give students directions on naming their files (e.g. Kaleidoscope-first-last.xml), then have them send this file to you. When you go to display their work, you can open <span class="snap">snap</span>, then choose "Import..." and the file.</li>
            <li>Take note of interesting approaches or creative ideas that would be interesting to share. Consider also asking students to submit yet-incomplete kaleidoscope or animation projects (give them some way of indicating this in the file name) if you see an interesting intermediate attempt that would spark discussion.</li>
