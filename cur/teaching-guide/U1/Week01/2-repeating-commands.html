    	<h2>Programming Lab 2: Control Commands</h2>
	    <p>Students use loops to repeat similar steps of code. Students compare and contrast functionally equivalent scripts (one that uses a loop and one without) to apprecaite the clarity, simplicity, and elegance of looping. Students consider the implications of nesting <code>repeat</code> blocks within <code>repeat</code> blocks and explore short scripts with <code>forever</code> and <code>for</code> blocks.</p>
        <p>Nesting <code>repeat</code> blocks within <code>repeat</code> blocks previews <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-building-and-debugging/4-building-blocks-within-blocks.html" target="_blank">Building Blocks within Blocks</a> in Lab 3. Students develop understanding of <strong>abstraction</strong> as they see how projects can be broken down into smaller tasks and programmed in chunks. This practice helps the programmer conceptualise the project and makes the code easier to read and debug. Recursion (calling a procedure from within itself) will be addressed in much greater detail in <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/5-recursion-trees-fractals.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html" target="_blank">Unit 5: Recursion</a> and <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/6-recursive-reporters.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html" target="_blank">Unit 6: Recursive Reporters</a>.</p>

        
        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 4 lab pages could be split across two or three days. Expected times to complete follow: <ul>
                <li>15-20 minutes on The <code>Repeat</code> Block</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Nesting Repeats</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on The <code>Forever</code> Block</li>
                <li>15-20 minutes on The <code>For</code> Block</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li>An important concept itself, nesting loops within loops also helps preview recusion, nesting custom procedures within themselves.</li>

                <li>Understand and use several basic kinds of loops (repeat, forever, and for)</li>
                <li>Learn the concept of nesting commands</li>

        <div class="todo">MF: Keep this here or is it in the student labs? Experiment with three input numbers in the script&mdash;4, 50, and 90. These determine the script's behavior. Discuss how each contributes to the square that is drawn. -MF </div>
        

        
        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <div class="comment">MF idea: Maybe include an animation of a script like (repeat 90: move 1 degree, wait .01 secs) and use it to explain the exterior/interior angle thing...</div>
		<div><ul>
        	<li><strong>Angles</strong>: High school geometry is not a requirement of this course, but students who have had it will be at an advantage when drawing polygons. Look to these students to share their knowledge about working with degrees. A common misunderstanding about drawing polygons for all new Snap<em>!</em> students  is to confuse the interior angles of the figure with the angles of sprite rotation. These are not generally the same, and are, in fact, supplementary. To clarify the distinction, have students draw sketches with marked angles and discuss why the term "supplementary" is appropriate.</li>
