    	<h2>Programming Lab 2: Control Commands</h2>
	    <p>Students become acquainted with the <span class="snap">snap</span> stage as a coordinate plane.</p>

        
        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
        	The 4 lab pages could be split across two or three days. Expected times to complete follow: <ul>
                <li>15-20 minutes on The <code>Repeat</code> Block</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on Nesting Repeats</li>
                <li>10-15 minutes on The <code>Forever</code> Block</li>
                <li>15-20 minutes on The <code>For</code> Block</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        
		<h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
        	<ul>
                <li>Prepare a <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/TG/computing-in-the-news.html">Computing in the News</a> story.</li>
            	<li>Make sure students know the procedure for doing their homework and turning it in, especially if they will do this assignment online.</li>
	        </ul>
        </div>


		<h3>Students will:</h3>

            <strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>An important concept itself, nesting loops within loops also helps preview recusion, nesting custom procedures within themselves.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice pair programming</li>
                <li>Appreciate the usefulness of looping</li>
                <li>Understand several basic kinds of loops (repeat, forever, and for)</li>
                <li>Learn the concept of nesting commands</li>
            </ul>
        </div> 

        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>Project this script <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/loop/draw-a-square.xml"> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/draw-square.png" alt="Square example image" title="Square example image"> </a> and ask students to predict what it does. You may wish to suggest students build it on their own before starting Lab 2, which starts by stating that it draws a square.</p>
        
        <h3>Discussions</h3>
Have then do this:
                <li>Experiment with three input numbers in the script&mdash;4, 50, and 90. These determine the script's behavior. Discuss how each contributes to the square that is drawn. </li>
        <p>Angles</p>
        <div class="comment">        MF and PG: Include an animation of a script like (repeat 90: move 1 degree, wait .01 secs) and use it to explain the exterior/interior angle thing.
</div>
        <p>High school geometry is not a requirement of this course, but students who have had it will be at an advantage when drawing polygons. Look to these students to share their knowledge about working with degrees. A common misunderstanding about drawing polygons for all new <span class="snap">snap</span> students  is to confuse the interior angles of the figure with the angles of sprite rotation. These are not generally the same, and are, in fact, supplementary. To clarify the distinction, have students discuss why this term is appropriate.</p>
