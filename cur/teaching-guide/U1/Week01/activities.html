Suggesting to teachers that they <em>might</em> want something of this sort is different from saying "prepare and copy for students to sign." <strong>csteachingtips</strong>'s idea that special rules (like no water) may feel arbitrary <em>if not given good reasons</em> is right on the mark.  Bruno's thing is simply "do what I say." I find it <em>really</em> offensive. </div>
