		<h2>Introduction to Teacher Guide</h2>
		<p>Welcome to the Teacher Guide (first version) for the Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC)  AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) course. This guide is designed to support high school CSP teachers with guidance on timing and activities for using the BJC student materials to teach important ideas of programming and the social implications of computing and to prepare students for the AP CSP Exam that launches Spring 2017. Please offer feedback on these teacher and student materials; your feedback is vital to their improvement. </p> 

	<h3>Equity and Inclusion</h3>
        <p>A primary goal of the course is to make rigorous computer science accessible to all students, especially to populations traditionally underrepresented in the field. Please take note of unmet needs for your students and any ideas you have for meeting them better, and communicate these with the research team via the blue feedback button and/or research participant surveys.</p>

        <h3>AP Computer Science Principles</h3>
        <p>BJC is one of several curricula that satisfy the framework for the new (starting 2016-17) AP CS Principles exam. Most AP courses have specific curricula, and are taught in broadly similar ways at every high school where they are offered. This one is different because it is <strong>meant to be equivalent to a college breadth course</strong>, rather than a first course for CS majors, and there is no uniformity in how colleges teach such a &quot;CS 0&quot; course. In particular, the exam is meant to be &quot;language agnostic,&quot; meaning that any programming language can be used in teaching it.</p>
        <p>The course was <strong>meant to attract historically underrepresented groups to computer science</strong>. It's an AP course because, as a tactical matter, it's much easier to get high schools across the country to introduce an AP course than a non-AP course for which there is no national high school standard curriculum. But always keep in mind that we are hoping to attract to the course kids who don't ordinarily view themselves as &quot;AP kids.&quot;</p>
        <p>The College Board framework gives minimum standards for each of the &quot;Big Ideas&quot; and &quot;Computational Thinking Practices&quot; listed to the right, but each curriculum has its own emphases. BJC puts a heavy emphasis on Programming and Global Impact.

        <h3>Course Pacing Guide:</h3>
        <p>This Beauty and Joy of Computing course is a draft high school adaptation of a popular UC Berkeley one-semester introduction to computer science, <a href="cs10.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">CS10</a>. This Teaching Guide is designed help high school  teachers prepare students for the AP Computer Science Principles Exam first available Spring 2017. To help AP classes stay on track, BJC is organized into 8 units designed to be split evenly across 2 semesters of 18 weeks each and assumes that classes meet around 4 hours per week and students ideally do 1 hours of BJC homework a week. As this curriculum is under development, the week-by-week timing should be considered as a guideline for long-term more than short-term planning. Also, unit names and structure will likely change as the course is refined.</p>

<!--    	<h3>Daily Class Structure</h3>
        <p>Every day starts with an <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/openers.html" target="_blank">Opener</a>, a 5-minute activity to start the class. (These are included in the Additional Problems/Activities included in each week.) The remainder of class time is used for:</p>

            <li><strong><a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/discussion.html" target="_blank">Discussions</a></strong>, a 5-20 minute activity before or after lab time, in which students have a discussion or debate about a Social Implication or Big Idea of Computing.</li>
            <li>
            	<strong>Labs</strong> comprise the remainder of class time, 25-40 minutes during which students generally work in pairs through online lab materials on the <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/1-intro-loops.topic">student pages</a>.</li>
        </ul></p>

    <h3>Student Materials:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Labs</strong>: This curriculum includes two kinds of labs:
                    <ul>
                        <div class="sidenote"><a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/" target="_blank">Blown to Bits</a> can be purchased in hard-copy, and it is also available online for free.</div>
                        <div class="comment">BH: Social Implications in all eight units!</div>
                        <li><strong>Programming Labs</strong>, in which students practice <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/pair-programming.html" target="_blank">pair programming</a> in <span class="snap">snap</span>, are included in each of the eight units.</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Implications Labs</strong>, in which students read, discuss, and write about issues of computing in society using the <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/excerpts/" target="_blank">Blown to Bits</a> book and various online articles. Social Implications Labs are included in the first four units.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Getting Started</strong>: Many labs include a "Getting Started" page that let students experience the ideas of the upcoming lab before formalizing them.  Getting Started lessons are designed for two purposes:
                	<ul>
                    	<li>to give students a preview, in simple and transparent contexts, of upcoming ideas.</li>
                        <li>to give teachers a sense of what prior knowledge students bring to the lab.</li>      
					</ul>
                    These Getting Started pages are meant to be done by students with minimal instruction from the teacher.  <strong>Students will likely not be able to answer every question in their pairs</strong>&mdash;that's part of the design. Be sure students understand that before they start the lab! Allow the sticking points to launch the lab topics that follow.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Assignments</strong>: Programming and social implications work done outside of class are recommended for a minimum of 1 hour a week, ideally more. These may  unit investigations, weekly assignment suggestions (reading, writing, and programming), or even lab materials (especially if done in pairs). Working outside of class provides more class time for discussion and support. Consider assigning about 1-2 hours of BJC homework each week. We acknowledge that some teachers in some schools will not be able to assign even 1 hour a week. Experiment to find the balance that works for your students.</li>
                <li><strong>Assessments</strong>: Many labs include multiple choice, formative, <em>ungraded</em> "Self Checks" (suggestions on effective student feedback messages appreciated). Regular projects and formal exams offer more summative feedback for teachers and students.</li>
                <div class="todo">Write more specifically about the AP exam and BJC exam.</div>
            </ul>
        </div>	

        
		<h3>Supporting Students</h3>
        <p>Both programming and thinking critically about culture are challenging pursuits. Encourage students to strive for excellence in their code and their anthropology. Help them find their own beauty and joy in computing. Adapt programming and social implications assignments to include and inspire students' interests.</p>            
        
        <h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <p>
            Ideally by the first day of school, teachers have:
        	<div class="sidenote">Consider also <a href="https://apcommunity.collegeboard.org/web/csprinciples/" target="_blank">becoming a member of the AP Teacher Community</a>, an online discussion forum with support for new teachers, CS Principles news, and instructional activities for Big Ideas.</div>

        </p>

    
        <h3>Teacher Materials:</h3>

        <p>
        	The following are included for each week of the year:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lab Notes</strong>: For each lab in the student materials, the Teacher Guide includes a purpose statement, teacher preparation tips, an overview of the work students will undertake, additional tips on presenting the ideas, what to be on the lookout for, and correlations to the AP CS Principles Computational Thinking Practices and Essential Knowledge, and additional resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Class Activities</strong>: Each week of Programming or Social Implications lab materials include several activities to support class discussion. These may be pieces of code to analyze or debug or a discussion or writing prompt about current events in computing. </li>        
                <li><strong>Homework Assignments:</strong> Assigning over an hour of homework each week is recommended. Depending on the group and students' access to the internet, teachers should select assignments from the bank of suggestions corresponding to each week. There are approximately two assignments offered per week, and these may include reading, writing, or programming tasks. Depending on your class, it might make sense to give more or less homework. Many of the Additional Problems/Activities can be used for homework assignments.</li>
