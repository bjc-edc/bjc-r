		<p>Welcome to the Teacher Guide for the Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC)  AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) course. This guide is designed to support high school CSP teachers with  timing and activities for  the BJC student materials to teach important ideas of programming and the social implications of computing and to prepare students for the AP CSP Exam. </p> 

		<h3>Equity and Inclusion</h3>
        <p>A primary goal of this course is to attract new students, especially those traditionally underrepresented in CS, to the joys and life opportunities that come with programming and computer science, and to make rigorous computer science accessible and enjoyable. Please  note  any ways this curriculum does not meet your students' needs   and any ideas you have for meeting them better, and tell the research team by using  the blue feedback button and/or research participant surveys.</p>

        <h3>AP Computer Science Principles</h3>
        <p>Several curricula  satisfy the framework for the new (starting 2020-2021) AP CS Principles exam. BJC is one. Most AP courses have specific curricula,  taught in  similar ways at every high school where they are offered. CS Principles is different because it is equivalent to a college <em>breadth</em> course rather than a first course for CS majors, and there is no uniformity in how colleges teach such a course. In particular, the exam is meant to be "language agnostic," meaning that any programming language can be used in the course.</p>
        <p><strong> CSP's specific goal is to attract students in groups that are historically underrepresented in computer science</strong>. It's an AP course  for tactical reasons: it's much easier to get high schools across the country to introduce an AP course than a non-AP course for which there is no national high school standard curriculum. But  keep in mind that the goal is to attract students who don't see themselves as "computer geeks" and may not  view themselves as "AP kids."</p>
        <p>The College Board framework sets minimum standards for each of the "Big Ideas" and "Computational Thinking Practices" listed to the right, but each curriculum has its own emphasis. BJC puts a heavy emphasis on Programming and Global Impact. <!--See also the <a href="http://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-curriculum-framework.pdf" target="_blank" title="College Board AP Computer Science Principles Curriculum Framework">College Board AP Computer Science Principles Curriculum Framework</a>.--></p>

        <h3>Course Pacing Guide:</h3>
        <p>This Beauty and Joy of Computing course is a pilot-year high school adaptation of a popular UC Berkeley one-semester introduction to computer science, <a href="cs10.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">CS10</a>. To help AP classes stay on track, BJC is organized into 8 units designed to be split evenly across 2 semesters of 18 weeks each and assumes that classes meet around 4 hours per week and students do 1 hour of BJC homework a week. As this curriculum is under development, the week-by-week timing should be considered as a guideline for long-term more than short-term planning. Unit names and structure will likely change as the course is refined.</p>

    	<h3>Pacing<a name="pacing" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
    	<p>Teaching any curriculum for the first time takes a lot more time and effort than repeated teaching of the same curriculum. Other unanticipated events (snow-days, absences, school issues) can also interfere with <em>any</em> teacher's schedule.</p>
        <p>To help you make decisions when pacing gets difficult, the Teacher Guide marks some pages with an asterisk. While <em>all</em> of the BJC pages (except for "Optional Projects" at the end of each unit) are part of the essence of BJC (<em>all</em> part of learning the beauty, the joy, and the computing) if you must adjust your schedule, these are the pages that are safe to skip (safe, in that students will <em>still</em> be able to do later pages and will still be safe for the AP).</p>
        <!--OUTDATED AND INCORRECT --MF, 8/20/19 <p>If you do skip those pages, a few of the over 300 "Essential Knowledge" points in the AP framework will be missed but none of the larger groupings (LO or EU). Your students should do fine on the AP. What they will miss is some of the flavor and exciting project ideas that make BJC unique.</p>-->
        <p>Units 1 through 6 cover the basic AP content and therefore must be finished <em>before</em> the AP exam. Units 7 and 8 expand on some of the beautiful and powerful ideas of computer science that are rarely if ever seen in other AP CSP courses.</p>
	<p><b>Please do not stand in front of the room talking!</b>  Teachers, especially good teachers, feel that they're not doing their job if they don't make handouts and lecture slides for each class meeting.  In this course, the curriculum itself does that kind of teaching.  <em>Your</em> job is to walk around the room, look over shoulders, and get kids unstuck, preferably by asking questions rather than by suggesting code.  <em>Every minute you spend in front of the room is a minute in which the class isn't learning the curriculum.</em>  This is one of the main reasons teachers have trouble completing the course on time.</p>


	<div class="takeNote"><b>Experience before formality:</b> In particular, please do not try to explain a key idea in a lab page in the abstract, before the class has had the experience of working with the idea.  In our pedagogy, such abstract presentations come <em>after</em> the activities that give rise to the need for an idea.  (This is the pedagogic equivalent to the key computer science idea of abstraction!)</div>

				<div class="todo">This section feels outdated. --MF, 8/20/19</div>
                <li><strong>Labs</strong>: BJC includes two kinds of labs:
                    <ul>
                        <div class="sidenote"><a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/" target="_blank" title="Blown to Bits">Blown to Bits</a> can be purchased in hard-copy, and it is also available online for free.</div>
                        <li><strong>Programming Labs</strong>, in which students practice <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/pair-programming.html" title="Pair Programming: Benefits and Use">pair programming</a> in <span class="snap">snap</span>, are included in each of the units.</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Implications Labs</strong>, in which students read, discuss, and write about issues of computing in society using the <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/excerpts/" target="_blank" title="Blown to Bits Download">Blown to Bits</a> book and various online articles. Social Implications Labs are heaviest in the first four units, to precede the AP Explore task.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The title "lab" is used for <em>all</em> sessions of this course to emphasize the laboratory style—experimentation, discussion, interaction—both in programming and in the analysis of social implications.</p>
                    <p>Both types of labs involve classroom discussion. Read more about <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/discussion.html" title="Facilitating a Classroom Discussion">Facilitating a Classroom Discussion</a>.</p>
                </li>
				<li><strong>Laboratory work style</strong>: Most programming labs<!--—especially the Getting Started pages (see below)— --> are designed to be done by students with minimal or no instruction from the teacher. Students are often not used to starting  and puzzling things out on their own; they often expect that things will be explained first and they then just practice;  they often expect that they are "supposed" to be able to do every problem that is assigned; and they often assume that they are expected to work alone.  <strong>This course is different.</strong> Make sure students know that working <em>together</em> is an important part of the course, that they can figure out a lot on their own, but that they should not be surprised or feel bad if <em>some</em> problems do stump them. That's completely expectable and totally fine.</li>
<!--				<li>
                	<strong>Getting Started</strong>: Many labs include a "Getting Started" page that let students experience and experiment with the ideas of the upcoming lab before formalizing them.  Getting Started lessons are designed for two purposes:
					<ul>
                    	<li>to give students a preview, in simple and transparent contexts, of upcoming ideas.</li>
                        <li>to give teachers a sense of what prior knowledge students bring to the lab.</li>      
					</ul>
        			<strong>Before students start their first "Getting Started" be sure that they understand that  they may <em>not</em> be able to answer every question in their pairs. That's ok.</strong> Encourage them to figure out what they can, check with other pairs, and try other problems. Puzzles that remain unsolved will get solved later. You can use the unsolved problems as a way to launch the lab topics that follow. 
                </li>
-->
		<li><strong>Journals</strong>: Considering requiring students
		    to keep a journal, which should contain
		    <ul><li>answers to "write down..." questions in the curriculum</li>
		    <li>a description of every program they write: what does
		    it do, what are the key algorithms, what new technique(s)
		    did they learn from writing it (if any), etc.</li>
		    <li>for every bug in their code:
			<ul><li>What was the symptom?</li>
			<li>What did the error turn out to be?</li>
			<li>How did they find the error?</li></ul>
		    The point of this is to encourage them to "love their bugs";
		    debugging code is how they learn.  And sometimes the bug
		    suggests an idea for a different interesting program.
		    It's important to model the idea that a bug isn't
		    shameful.</li>
		    <li>occasional mini-essays answering a focused
		    social implications question</li></ul>
		Don't grade the journal!  It's for them, not you.</li>
                <li><strong>Assignments</strong>: We recommend a minimum of 1 hour a week, ideally more, for programming and social implications work done outside of class. It's understood that school and home situations vary. In some situations even 1 hour a week may not be practical. Experiment to find the balance that works for your students. Outside-of-class work may include unit investigations, weekly assignment suggestions (reading, writing, and programming), or even lab materials (especially if done in pairs). Working outside of class provides more class time for discussion and support.  </li>
                <li><strong>Assessments</strong>: <b>Please do not grade the daily lab activities!</b>  They are <em>not</em> intended as assessments, but rather as explorations.  If a student doesn't know where to begin on a lab, don't add grade anxiety to "I can't learn this" anxiety.  There are <em>unit</em> assessments (not in the student pages), which should come about once a month.
		<p>Some labs include multiple choice, formative, <em>ungraded</em> "Self Checks" (suggestions on effective student feedback messages appreciated). <em>You do not  have to collect and review these. </em>Regular projects offer plenty of opportunity for formative feedback for teachers and students, and formal exams will provide  summative information.</li>
                <div class="todo">Write more specifically about the AP exam and BJC exam.</div>
            </ul>
        </div>

		<h3>Supporting Students</h3>
        <p>Both programming and thinking critically about culture are challenging pursuits. Encourage students to strive for excellence in their code and their anthropology. Help them find their own beauty and joy in computing. Adapt programming and social implications assignments to include and inspire students' interests.</p>

		    <li>If a student pair finishes a lab page early, they can
		    work on these instead of jumping to the next page.  But
		    don't let students rush through the main activities to
		    get to these; they should take the time to understand
		    what they're doing and why.</li>
		    <li>All of the If There Is Time activities are "hinted"
		    so that they don't make the page feel infinitely long
		    to students still working on the main lesson.</li>

                    <li>These problems are valuable and encouraged, but students <em>can</em> proceed to next lessons without doing these. In that sense, they are optional.</li>
		    <li>Like the "If There Is Time" activities, these are best
		    when self-assigned.  Students should be prepared to have
		    their minds stretched by these, and should enjoy (or learn
		    to enjoy) that feeling.</li>
		    <li>They are lettered rather than numbered to emphasize

                    <li>You can use them as differentiation for students who move faster.</li>
