<h3 id="compThinking" class="anchor">Highlighting Computational Thinking</h3>
        	<div><div class="sidenote">AP CS Principles identifies six Computational Thinking Practices:<br><strong>P1</strong> Connecting Computing<br><strong>P2</strong> Creating Computational Artifacts<br><strong>P3</strong> Abstracting<br><strong>P4</strong> Analyzing Problems and Artifacts<br><strong>P5</strong> Communicating<br><strong>P6</strong> Collaborating</div></div>
            
            <div>One way students develop their computational thinking skills is through direct experience with <span class="snap">snap</span>. For example, students are frequently asked to predict what they think will result from a given <span class="snap">snap</span> script. Making such predictions requires students to make sense of the sequential nature of the code. Students are introduced to the idea of abstraction, and will experience this way of thinking as they learn what details they can manipulate or safely overlook in a script as they explore it, and as they are introduced to functions as a way to generalize processes. The emphasis on Pair Programming in Unit 1 is meant to help students communicate and collaborate in problem solving. Finally, students engage with the broader world of computing in exploring topics related to its impacts. As students write about and debate important social issues, they develop the thinking skills required to analyze complex issues.

        <h3 id="structure" class="anchor">Class Structure and Content</h3>

    <div>One lesson is approximately 45 minutes. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DYPzo2OS-tf0c_O2W23JCjETnh21Lp8pE8YIx_hjFmw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">(How can I structure my class for different lengths of time?)</a> -->
    
        <div>
            The content is presented in weeks, assuming that classes meet around 4 hours per week.
            Class time generally falls into one of five categories, plus homework: NEED TO EDIT!!
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Opener</strong>, a 5-minute activity to start the class. There are four kinds of Openers:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html"><strong>Computing in the News</strong></a><br>  Students are presented with and discuss a current news story about computing. Students gain a greater sense of the relevance of computing in society, are exposed to complex social issues, and learn to read news stories with an informed and critial eye.</li>
                        <li><strong>Make a Prediction</strong><br> Students predict the result of a piece of code. Students reason through the logic of code. Teachers might use these to introduce a new concept or address a common misconception.</li>
                        <li><strong>Aww, Snap!</strong><br> Students are presented with code containing an error and must debug it. Students gain experience with debugging and must make sense of code. Teachers might use these to point to a common pitfall or teach a debugging strategy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Snap Judgment</strong><br> Students write down their view in response to a prompt about a Social Implications topic. This is not meant to be polished writing, or even take a view that students firmly believe. The purpose is to engage students and support written communication skills. Throughout the year, students should develop their ability to state a position and provide evidence to support it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Research</strong>, 10-15 minutes in which students learn about a topic by reading an article or looking up information online</li>
                <li><strong>Sharing Student Work</strong>, a 10-15 minute class discussion in which students see the posted work of others to talk about different problem-solving approaches and common pitfalls, or just to showcase students' creativity</li>
                <li><strong>Discussion</strong>, a 25-30 minute activity in which students might have a discussion or debate about a Social Implication or Big Idea of Computing</li>
                <li><strong>Lab</strong>, 25-40 minutes during which students generally work in pairs through online lab materials on the <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/1-intro-loops.topic">student pages</a></li>
                <li><strong>Homework</strong> There are approximately two homework assignments provided per week.</li>
                <div class="endnote">Depending on your class, it might make sense to give more or less homework. Many of the Opener or Research activities can be used for homework assignments as well.</div>
