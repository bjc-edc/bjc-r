		<h2>Introduction to Teacher Guide</h2>
		<p>Welcome to the first version of the Beauty and Joy of Computing AP Computer Science Principles Teacher Guide. This guide is designed to support high school AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) teachers in preparing students for the AP CSP Exam that launches Spring 2017. Please read (and offer feedback on) these teacher and student materials; teacher feedback is vital to their improvement. </p> 

		<h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>A primary goal in the development of this course is to make rigorious computer science accessible to all students, especially to populations traditionally underrepresented in the field. Please take note of unmet needs for your students and any ideas you have for meeting them better, and communicate these with the research team via the blue feedback button and/or research participant surveys.</p>

        <h3>BJC Course Structure/Pacing:</h3>
        <p>These materials are an early adaptation of a popular UC Berkeley one semester course, <a href="cs10.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">CS10</a>, into a high school AP Computer Science Principles course. To help AP classes stay on track for the year, this curriculum is organized into 8 Units designed to be split across 2 semesters of 18 weeks each and assumes that classes meet around 4 hours per week. As this curriculum is under development, the week-by-week timing should be considered as a guideline for long-term rather than day-by-day planning.</p>
        
        <p>
        	Fall Term:
            <ul>
            	<li>Unit 1: Introduction to <span class="snap">snap</span> (4 weeks)</li>
                <li>Unit 2: Conditionals, Abstraction, and Testing (4 weeks)</li>
                <li>Quarter 1 Project (1 week)</li>
                <li>Unit 3: Lists (4 weeks)</li>
                <li>Unit 4: Algorithm Complexity (5 weeks)</li>
            </ul>
            Spring Term:
            <ul>
                <li>AP Explore Task  (2 weeks)</li>
                <li>Unit 5: Recursion (2 weeks)</li>
                <li>Unit 6: Recursive Reporters (3 weeks)</li>
                <li>AP Create Task (3 weeks)</li>
                <li>Unit 7: Big Data (2 weeks)</li>
                <li>AP Prep and Review (1 week)</li>
                <li>AP Exam (1 week)</li>
                <li>Unit 8: Python and Final Project (4 weeks)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
                
        <p>Is is important to keep classes on track for the AP Exam, which begins in Spring 2017 and is scheduled into this course before Unit 8. Unit 7 is crucial to success on the AP Exam, so teachers who are pressed for time are encouraged to postpone all of Unit 6 and ensure that Unit 7 is solid before the exam. Teachers should take note of their pacing and ideas for improvement for the next year both for their own planning and to offer feedback to the curriculum research and development team.</p>
    
    	<h3>Daily Class Structure</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li><strong><a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/openers.html" target="_blank">Openers</a></strong>, 5-minute activities, start the class.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/discussion.html" target="_blank">Discussions</a></strong>, a 25-30 minute activity before or after lab time, in in which students have a discussion or debate about a Social Implication or Big Idea of Computing.</li>
            <li>
            	<strong>Labs</strong> comprise the remainder of class time, 25-40 minutes during which students generally work in pairs through online lab materials on the <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/1-intro-loops.topic">student pages</a>. This curriculum includes two kinds of labs:

                    <li><strong>Social Implications Labs</strong>, in which students read, discuss, and write about issues of computing in society using the <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/excerpts/" target="_blank">Blown to Bits</a> book and various online articles. Social Implications Labs are included in the first 4 units.</li>

                <li><strong>Additional Assignments:</strong> Assigning homework is optional but recommended. Depending on the group and students' access to the internet, teachers should select assignments from the bank of suggestions corresponding to each week. There are approximately two assignments offered per week, and these may include reading, writing, or programming tasks. Depending on your class, it might make sense to give more or less homework. Many of the Additional Problems/Activities and also the Take it Further problems in the Programming Labs can be used for homework assignments as well.</li>

            <div>One way students develop their computational thinking skills is through direct experience with <span class="snap">snap</span>. For example, students are frequently asked to predict what they think will result from a given <span class="snap">snap</span> script. Making such predictions requires students to make sense of the sequential nature of the code. Students are introduced to the idea of abstraction, and will experience this way of thinking as they learn what details they can manipulate or safely overlook in a script as they explore it, and as they are introduced to functions as a way to generalize processes. The emphasis on Pair Programming in Unit 1 is meant to help students communicate and collaborate in problem solving. Finally, students engage with the broader world of computing in exploring topics related to its impacts. As students write about and debate important social issues, they develop the thinking skills required to analyze complex issues.
