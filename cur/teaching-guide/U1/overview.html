		<h2>Introduction to Teacher Guide</h2>
		<p>Welcome to the first version of the Beauty and Joy of Computing AP Computer Science Principles Teacher Guide. This guide is designed to support high school AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) teachers in preparing students for the AP CSP Exam that launches Spring 2017. Please read (and offer feedback on) these teacher and student materials; teacher feedback is vital to their improvement. </p> 

		<h3>Broadening Participation</h3>
        <p>A primary goal in the development of this course is to make rigorous computer science accessible to all students, especially to populations traditionally underrepresented in the field. Please take note of unmet needs for your students and any ideas you have for meeting them better, and communicate these with the research team via the blue feedback button and/or research participant surveys.</p>

        <h3>Course Pacing Guide:</h3>
        <p>This Beauty and Joy of Computing high school course is an draft adaptation of a popular UC Berkeley one semester introuction to computer science, <a href="cs10.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">CS10</a>. This Teaching Guide is designed help high school  teachers prepare students for the AP Computer Science Principles Exam first available Spring 2017. To help AP classes stay on track, BJC is organized into 8 units designed to be split evenly across 2 semesters of 18 weeks each and assumes that classes meet around 4 hours per week and students ideally do 1 hours of BJC homework a week. As this curriculum is under development, the week-by-week timing should be considered as a guideline for long-term rather than day-by-day planning.</p>

        	<strong>Fall Term</strong>:
            <div class="comment">Consider making Unit 3: Lists and Big Data...</div>
            <ul>
            	<li>Unit 1: Introduction to <span class="snap">snap</span> (3 weeks)</li>
                <li>Unit 2: Conditionals, Abstraction, and Testing (3 weeks)</li>

            </ul>
            <div class="commentBig">All: Team needs to decide the difference between the AP Create Task and the "Final Project." Maybe the Create Task <em>is</em> the Final Project, and they just do it early?</div>
			<div class="commentBig">We have been discussing this order instead:
                <ul>
                    <li>Unit 7: Big Data</li>

                    <li>Unit 8: Python and Final Project</li>
            	</ul>
			</div>
            <strong>Spring Term</strong>:

        </p>
                
        <p>It is important to keep classes on track because Unit 7: Big Data is crucial to success on the AP Exam. Teachers who are pressed for time are encouraged to postpone all of Unit 6 and so as to cover Unit 7 fully and give students time for exam prep. Teachers should take note of their pacing and ideas for improvement for the next year (when the actual exam starts, Spring 2017) both for their own planning and to offer feedback to the curriculum research and development team.</p>
    
    	<h3>Daily Class Structure</h3>
        <p>Every day starts with an <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/openers.html" target="_blank">Opener</a>, a 5-minute activity to start the class. (These are included in the Additional Problems/Activities included in each week.) The remainder of class time is used for:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li><strong><a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/discussion.html" target="_blank">Discussions</a></strong>, a 5-20 minute activity before or after lab time, in which students have a discussion or debate about a Social Implication or Big Idea of Computing.</li>
            <li>
            	<strong>Labs</strong> comprise the remainder of class time, 25-40 minutes during which students generally work in pairs through online lab materials on the <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/1-intro-loops.topic">student pages</a>.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Labs</strong>: This curriculum includes two kinds of labs:
                    <ul>
                        <div class="sidenote"><a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/" target="_blank">Blown to Bits</a> can be purchased in hard-copy, and it is also available online for free.</div>
                        <li><strong>Programming Labs</strong>, in which students practice <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/pair-programming.html" target="_blank">pair programming</a> in <span class="snap">snap</span>, are included in each of the 8 units.</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Implications Labs</strong>, in which students read, discuss, and write about issues of computing in society using the <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/excerpts/" target="_blank">Blown to Bits</a> book and various online articles. Social Implications Labs are included in the first 4 units.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <div class="comment">These problems are designed to be difficult and not necessarily even do-able before doing the lab. don't overteach here</div>
                <li><strong>Getting Started</strong>: Many labs include a "Getting Started" page for students experience the ideas of the lab before formalizing them.</li>
            	<div class="todo">MF: What else do we want to say here?</div>
                <li><strong>Assignments</strong>: Programming and social implications projects done outside of class are recommended. These may be Hour(s) of Code (in Unit 1), unit project suggestions, weekly assignment suggestions (reading, writing, and programming), or even lab materials (especially if done in pairs). Working outside of class provides more class time for discussion and support. Consider assigning about 1-2 hours of BJC homework each week. Experiment to find the balance that works for your students.</li>
                <div class="comment">Do we want to write about the AP exam, our exam, or anything else here?</div>
                <li><strong>Assessments</strong>: Many labs include multiple choice, formative, <em>ungraded</em> "Self Checks" (suggestions on effective student feedback appreciated), and regular projects and discussions offer more summative feedback for teachers and students.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>	

        
		<h3>Supporting Students</h3>
        <p>Both programming and thinking critically about culture are challenging pursuits. Encourage students to strive for excellence in their code and their anthropology. Help them find their own beauty and joy in computing. Adapt programming and social implications assignments to include and inspire students' interests.</p>
            
        
        <div class="todo">Team only got this far in the meeting.</div>

        <div class="comment">MF: Can we call them "Additional Assignments" instead of "homework"? Some classes won't have homework.</div>
        <p>
        	The following are included for each week of the year:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lab Notes</strong>: For each lab in the student materials, the Teaching Guide includes a purpose statement, teacher preparation tips, an overview of the work students will undertake, additional tips on presenting the ideas, what to be on the lookout for, and correlations to the AP CS Principles Computational Thinking Practices and Essential Knowledge, and addtional resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Activities</strong>: Each week of Programming or Social Implications lab materials include several activities to support class discussion. These may be pieces of code to analyze or debug or a discussion or writing prompt about current events in computing. </li>        
                <li><strong>Additional Assignments:</strong> Assigning homework is optional but recommended. Depending on the group and students' access to the internet, teachers should select assignments from the bank of suggestions corresponding to each week. There are approximately two assignments offered per week, and these may include reading, writing, or programming tasks. Depending on your class, it might make sense to give more or less homework. Many of the Additional Problems/Activities and also the Take it Further problems in the Programming Labs can be used for homework assignments as well.</li>

            <div>One way students develop their computational thinking skills is through direct experience with <span class="snap">snap</span>. For example, students are frequently asked to predict what they think will result from a given <span class="snap">snap</span> script. Making such predictions requires students to make sense of the sequential nature of the code. Students are introduced to the idea of abstraction, and will experience this way of thinking as they learn what details they can manipulate or safely overlook in a script as they explore it, and as they are introduced to functions as a way to generalize processes. The emphasis on Pair Programming in Unit 1 is meant to help students communicate and collaborate in problem solving. Finally, students engage with the broader world of computing in exploring topics related to its impacts. As students write about and debate important social issues, they develop the thinking skills required to analyze complex issues.
