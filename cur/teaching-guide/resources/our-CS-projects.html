		<h2>Projects Related to Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC)</h2>
		<!--<img style="height:100px;" class="noshadow imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/header-footer/EDC_logo.png" alt="EDC" />-->
		<p>Our work in K-12 computer science includes <strong>curricula</strong> for high school (BJC CSP), middle school (BJC Sparks), and elementary students (Math+C) and <strong>research projects</strong> that study the implementation and growth of CS programs in schools and districts.&nbsp;</p>

		<h3>BJC CSP</h3>
		<a href="http://bjc.edc.org"><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/web/bjc-logo.png" alt="Beauty and Joy of Computing" title="Beauty and Joy of Computing" /></a>
		<!--<img class="noshadow, imageRight" style="height: 160px" src="/bjc-r/img/ap-support/APCSP_ProviderBadge_lg.png" alt="AP CSP Endorsed badge" title="AP CSP Endorsed badge" />-->
		<p><a href="https://bjc.edc.org/" title="Beauty and Joy of Computing: Computer Science Principles" target="_blank">Beauty and Joy of Computing: Computer Science Principles</a> (BJC CSP) is an introductory computer science course developed by the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) and Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC). BJC CSP uses the visual programming language, <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/" title="Snap! programming language" target="_blank">Snap<em>!</em></a>, to offer access to rigorous programming concepts without the overhead of syntax required by a text-based language. Both BJC CSP and Snap<em>!</em> are available online for free.</p>
		<p>BJC is recognized by the College Board as an endorsed provider of curriculum and professional development for Advanced Placement® Computer Science Principles (AP CSP). Through a sequence of 8 units, the year-long course covers the 6 AP CSP Computational Thinking Practices and 5 Big Ideas with extra attention to programming including higher order functions and (in later units) recursion.</p>
		<p>BJC CSP has been developed with funding from the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education and is designed for use in high school in an AP or non-AP context and offered as CS10 at UC Berkeley. </p>

		<h3>BJC Sparks</h3>

		<p><a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/sparks" title="Beauty and Joy of Computing: Sparks" target="_blank">Beauty and Joy of Computing: Sparks</a> (BJC Sparks) is also an introductory computer science curriculum developed by UC Berkeley and EDC that uses Snap<em>!</em>. BJC Sparks and Snap<em>!</em> are available online for free.</p>
		<p>BJC Sparks addresses the CSTA standards for middle school through 3 units that each cover a different programming style: Unit 1: Functions and Data covers the basics of functional programming through activities on string manipulation, data processing, and image manipulation. Unit 2: Sequencing and Iteration introduces imperative and event-based programming through sound and music, animation, smart systems, and data transmission. Unit 3: Physical Computing teaches physical computing using the BBC micro:bit.</p>
		<p>BJC Sparks is being developed with funding from the Hopper-Dean Foundation, is designed for use in middle school or early high school, and can serve as a complementary introduction to the BJC CSP course.</p>
		
		<h3>Elementary Math and Programming</h3>

		<p><a href="https://elementarymath.edc.org/k-5/" title="Think Math!" target="_blank">Think Math!</a> is a curriculum for grades K–5 that fosters children’s natural curiosity and helps them develop strong mathematical habits of mind through puzzles, investigations, and games that provide opportunities for surprise, pattern finding, and mathematical thinking.</p>
		<p><a href="https://elementarymath.edc.org/programming/" title="Math+C" target="_blank">Math+C</a> is a collection of opportunities for children to explore key mathematical content through the block-based programming language Snap<em>!</em>. Lessons are organized in mini-units aligned to grade-level standards, in which students build and debug their own scripts in order to solve a series of engaging mathematical puzzles.</p>
		<p>Think Math! and Math+C have been developed by EDC with funding from the National Science Foundation, and all content is available online for free.</p>
		
		<h3>Research-Practice Partnership between EDC and NYCDOE</h3>
		<p>The Education Development Center (EDC) and the New York City (NYC) Department of Education (NYCDOE) have been in partnership since 2015 to bring CS to NYC students. The purpose of the current research-practice partnership (RPP), which started in 2018, is to increase access to CS in all NYC schools, with a particular focus on enhancing and studying the implementation of high school AP CSP courses in high-need and low-performing schools.</p>
		
		<p>The project is carrying out the following activities:
		<ul>
			<li>Understanding the challenges that teachers and schools face in implementing AP CSP courses</li>
			<li>Adapting AP CSP programs currently in NYC to better meet the needs of low-performing high schools and their students</li>
			<li>Providing professional development and implementation support to additional cohorts of AP CSP teachers</li>
			<li>Refining school and teacher supports that include school and teacher leadership professional development, curriculum resources, and differentiation of PD supports using continuous improvement methods</li>
			<li>Cultivating trust and strengthening relationships across the partnership to advance the work and support continued thinking about the problems of practice in <a href="https://sites.google.com/schools.nyc.gov/cs4allnyc/" title="CS4All" target="_blank">NYC CS4All</a></li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>This work is funded by the National Science Foundation.</p>
		
		<h3>Improving Equity in AP CSP Courses</h3>
		<p><a href="https://edc.org/improving-equity-advanced-placement-computer-science-principles-courses" title="EIR" target="_blank">Improving Equity in AP CSP Courses</a> is a project aimed at building the capacity of participating high schools to support an AP CSP course centered on the BJC curriculum and to help ensure that all students have access to equitable and excellent computer science instruction. For this project, which began in 2021, EDC is working closely with partners Abt Associates and North Carolina State University to scale up the BJC course.</p>
	
		<p>The project features the following three central components:
			<ul>
				<li>A school CS equity program designed to broaden participation in CS coursework by using specific strategies and resources to recruit, enroll, and retain students from groups underrepresented in CS (e.g., female students, Black students, Latinx students, students from low-income families)</li>
				<li>A teacher learning program that builds capacity for equitable and rigorous CS instruction and prepares teachers to support students’ successful completion of AP CSP</li>
				<li>An emphasis on supporting effective use of BJC, including following the AP CSP framework and BJC design principles</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>This work is funded by the US Department of Education through an early-phase Education Innovation Research (EIR) grant.</p>
