        <h2>Programming Lab 2: Script Variables</h2>
        <p>Students have already created blocks that have input variables, and have used those input variables within the block's script. This lab introduces the  <code>script variables (a)</code> block, which allows the programmer to create variables for scripts that are <em>not</em> inside blocks, and extra temporary variables for blocks that need them. Script variables exist only while the script is running. They allow you to save, use, or modify  information that the script will need while it is running. Also, script variables exist  <em>only inside that script</em>. Blocks used <em>inside</em> a script can set, use, or change the value of that script's script variables; blocks outside of that script can not.</p>
        <p>This lab  gives students practice building several common mathematical functions using script variables, and also gives them practice building several predicates that they are likely to find useful in future projects. Students get continued opportunities to debug before lab 3, which begins to focus on the development of more complex programs.</p>
<h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Getting, renaming, setting, and using a script variable are all new. Some students will need help just building the script shown in problem 1 on the first page of this lab. An animation shows most of what they will need to do, but make sure you are comfortable enough, yourself, to help if that is needed.</li>
                <li>With other programming, analyzing, and debugging problems, it can actually be useful for you <em>not</em> to look fully fluent, even if you know exactly what to do. Showing how you might <em>puzzle out</em> the problem can be an excellent way of modeling the thinking for your students. You don't have to &quot;fake&quot; not knowing; just asking what various bits of the program do, or what they're supposed to do, or how the student figured out what to put in or where to put it, or pausing for a moment to ponder the result, or trying various inputs to see how the program responds can be enormously helpful to the student because it <em>illustrates</em> a good analysis/debugging technique. Often enough, students then find the solutions themselves.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Students will:</h3>

        	<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
        	<ul>
            	<li>In Unit 6, students will learn how to use <strong>recursion</strong> to understand <code>factorial</code> and <code>power</code> (and some other functions for which they are currently creating using script variables) in a new way.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Create <code>factorial</code> and <code>power</code> and other functions using script variables. </li>
                <li>Create several predicates that will be useful in later projects. </li>
                <li>Analyze and debug some code that doesn't work properly.</li>
            </ul>
        </div> 
              
        
        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>As in Lab 1, class time can be mostly lab.  </li>
                <li>Students work in pairs, switching regularly. You remain available for help, but encourage students to check with each other, as well, for ideas and help.  </li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h3>Look For:</h3>
        <div><ul><li>As you notice interesting student work—creative responses to assigned tasks, ideas that go beyond the tasks, or interesting bugs—you may choose to have students share, but allow plenty of time for students to do the programming.</li></ul></div>
