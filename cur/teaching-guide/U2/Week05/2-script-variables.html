        <h2>Programming Lab 2: Script Variables</h2>
        <p>Students have already created blocks that have input variables, and have used those input variables within the block's script. The <code>script variables (a)</code> block allows the programmer to create variables for scripts that are <em>not</em> inside blocks, and extra temporary variables for blocks that need them. </p>
        <p>Script variables exist only while the script is running. They allow you to save, use, or modify  information that the script will need while it is running. Also, script variables exist  <em>only inside that script</em>. Blocks used inside the script can set, use, or change the value of that script variable, but other blocks do not.</p> 
        

<h3>Prepare:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>There is a fair amount of overhead to getting, renaming, setting, and using a script variable. Some students will need help just building the script shown in problem 1 on the first page of this lab. An animation shows most of what they will need to do, but make sure you are comfortable enough, yourself, to help if that is needed.</li>
                <li>With other programming, analyzing, and debugging problems, it can actually be useful for you <em>not</em> to look fully fluent, even if you know exactly what to do. Showing how you might <em>puzzle out</em> the problem can be an excellent way of modeling the thinking for your students. You don't have to &quot;fake&quot; not knowing; just asking what various bits of the program do, or what they're supposed to do, or how the student figured out what to put in or where to put it, or pausing for a moment to ponder the result, or trying various inputs to see how the program responds can be enormously helpful to the student because it <em>illustrates</em> a good analysis/debugging technique. Often enough, students then find the solutions themselves.</li>
