        <h2>Week 4 Additional Problems/Activities</h2>


		<p>Additional Problems/Activities to use as openers, exit slips, discussion/writing prompts, or formative assessments (for use in the indicated lab).</p>

        <h3><a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/openers.html">Openers</a></h3>

                <li><strong>Analyze a script</strong> (any time): Project either or both of  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/MysteryScript1.png" alt="mystery script 1"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/MysteryScript2.png" alt="mystery script 2"> and ask students to predict the behavior.</li>

<h3>Introduction to Lab 1</h3>
	<ul>
    <li><strong>Analyze a script</strong>: Project the scripts <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/follow-that-mouse.png" alt="Follow That Mouse Script"/> and  <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/repeat-until-direction-equals-90-move-1-turn-cw-1.png" alt="repeat-until-direction-equals-90-move-1-turn-clockwise-1"> and ask students to describe what they will do. These should be familiar.</li>
     <li><strong>Analyze a task</strong>: Project this animated image
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/Writing-Mouse-on-the-stage.gif" alt="using the mouse to write &quot;mouse&quot; on the stage"></p>
                <p>and ask students to describe the behavior they are seeing.</p>
                <p>You can expect that initial contributions will be fairly general&mdash;&quot;The computer is writing the word 'mouse'&quot; or even &quot;It's writing in two colors.&quot; It's <em>sensible</em>  to start with the global behavior. Continue asking for contributions, that add more precision or detail: &quot;It looks like  the writing changes to red when it gets to the top half of the screen&quot; or &quot;the sprite <em>and</em> the mouse are moving together&quot; or.... </p>
      <p>Observations like these help the student recognize what features might be needed in a <em>program</em> that can create this behavior.</p></li>
