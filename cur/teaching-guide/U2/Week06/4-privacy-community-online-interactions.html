            	<li>You may want to think about how your classroom space is set up. If it is possible to move away from computers and even arrange chairs in a circle, this will help establish a discussion space.</li>
                <li>There are many options for students to access <em>Blown to Bits</em>. They can read it as an <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter1.pdf">online PDF</a> or you may choose to purchase hard copies of the book. You may also photocopy the book for students so that they can make annotations as they read.</li>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <div>
        	<strong>Examine some cases of cyberbullying.</strong> Have students work in small groups for 10-15 minutes researching the issue of cyberbullying online. Guiding question: <em>What are some different forms that cyberbullying can take?</em> For example, they might look at resources like:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://nobullying.com/six-unforgettable-cyber-bullying-cases/">Six Unforgettable CyberBullying Cases (NoBullying.com)</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.violencepreventionworks.org/public/cyber_bullying.page">Cyber Bullying (Violence Prevention Works)</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/Passcode-Voices/2015/0327/How-to-defeat-Internet-bullies">How to defeat Internet bullies (CS Monitor)</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://stopcyberbullying.org/educators/howdoyouhandleacyberbully.html">What methods work with the different kinds of cyberbullies? (stopcyberbullying.org)</a></li>
            </ul> 
        </div>
        <div>Students will <strong>engage in a 25-30 minute discussion.</strong> There are three parts to this discussion:
            <div class="comment">Maybe move some of this to  <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/discussion.html">Facilitating Classroom Discussion</a>? -MF</div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Establish norms for classroom discussion. Ask: <em>What are some important guidelines we should keep as a class?</em> Record these to refer back to in future discussions. Examples may include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>We want to hear from as many people as possible. (It may make sense for students to raise their hands when they have something to say, and a facilitator - teacher or student - to write down students' names in order on the board. The students then know what order in which to speak, don't have to keep their hands raised, and the facilitator doesn't have to interrupt to call on people. In this case, it might also help to have a special sign students can make for when they would urgently like to respond to a comment, though this should be used sparingly.)</li>
                        <li>We will be discussing sensitive topics; we should treat all contributions with respect. We also know that people's views can change or may not come across as they intended, so we won't jump to conclusions about people's views from their short contributions here.</li>
                        <li>We want to keep a spirit of inquiry during discussion; this is not the time to insist on being "right."</li>
                        <li>We want to acknowledge each other's contributions and speak to each other, addressing each other by name.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Share some of the findings from the online research. <em>What are some different forms that cyberbullying can take?</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students can share stories they found or different definitions of cyberbullying.</li>
                        <li>Possible follow-up question: Did anyone find themselves re-thinking their Snap Judgment response from the beginning of class?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>What are some possible ways to effectively address this issue?</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students may choose to focus on what they can do individually, what they should think should happen in schools, or what should be done at a societal level.</li>
                        <li>Follow-up: What are the challenges to addressing cyberbullying? For example, students may raise first amendment rights, privacy issues regarding their communication, or the ability to assume other identities or operate anonymously online.</li>
                    </ul>
