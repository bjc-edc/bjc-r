        <h2>Programming Lab 3: Developing More Complex Programs</h2>
        <p>Throughout Lab 3, students focus almost exclusively on ideas of <strong>abstraction</strong> to serve the goals  writing clear, debuggable, improvable code in order to develop more complex programs.</p>
        <p>There is little new <span class="snap">snap</span> code in Lab 3. Nor is the idea of abstraction—analyzing a task to think about what its chunks or component parts or special cases might be and then building blocks that <em>specialize</em> in each of them—really new. Students did that when they built <code>plural</code>. But learning to think that way takes time and experience. In this lab, students work on three projects. Both the game board project and the number-guessing-game project are very extensible and modifiable and may lead students to their own ideas.</p>
        <p>The lab ends with two shorter activities&mdash;essentially how-to's&mdash;showing techniques that can be useful in more complex programming tasks.</p>
<h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Search for some Computing in the News topics, or ask your students to look for them in advance.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h3>Students will:</h3>
        <div class="sidenoteBig">
        	<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
        	<ul>
            	<li>The tools developed in this unit anticipate a variety of games that students will be able to develop: tic-tac-toe, magic-square games, and others. More powerful programming techniques&mdash;particularly <strong>lists</strong> which are the major new programming idea in Unit 3&mdash;are useful in completing these games.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Build some tools for board games: a block to draw square arrays of various sizes for the game board, and a block that determines which cell within that array where the sprite is in.</li>
                <li>Build a number guessing game in which the user tries to guess the computer's secret number, and the computer tries to respond with as human-like dialogue as the programmer can build.</li>
                <li>Learn how to specify the type of input that a block is expecting to receive.</li>
                <li>Get a bit of practice composing functions.</li>
            </ul>
</div> 
              
        
        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div><ul>
<li>Except for a Computing in the News, and the usual option of having students share particularly interesting problems or results, treat this lab as largely work-with-your-partner time.</li></ul></div>


        <h3>Look For:</h3>
        <div><ul>
          <li>As always, look for students who have interesting result to share.</li>
          <li>As always, look for students who seem stuck and are not getting the support that they need from their partner .</li>
        </ul>
</div>
