        <h2>Programming Lab 1: Conditional Blocks</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <ul>
                <li>GH Feedback 9/8/15: Looking specifically at the Introducing conditionals yellow box...those examples are a bit confusing. If you touch "here" do one thing else do something else - do you mean if the user touches anywhere else only one something else happens? That doesn't make sense and students will be confused. The ATM example is fine because you don't introduce else, but that is problematic. A better example might be checking a password or ATM pin number - if the password matches then let the person in else ask them to enter it again. That analogy is extensible to else if that checks to see the number of times the password has been entered, etc.</li>
                <li>We need to write tips for using the Thinking Out Loud dialog. --MF</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>This lab introduces two small and extensible projects programming the computer to produce parts of English phrases: a block that can decide which of "a" or "an" to use with the following noun and a block that spells the correct plurals of input nouns. Both of these projects require <strong>conditionals</strong> (students focus on <code>if else</code> and <code>if</code>) using <strong>predicates</strong> (blocks that report <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> based on tests they perform) to control the behavior of their programs. Students use built-in predicates such as <code>&lt;</code> and <code>=</code>, and they learn to build their own predicates, such as <code>vowel?</code>, which reports <code>true</code> if its input letter is a vowel and <code>false</code> if it is not. Students also use conditionals to control action based on the results of predicates that test the <var>direction</var> and <var>y position</var> of the sprite.</p>
        <div class="endnote"><strong>One way to introduce the idea of conditionals to your students.</strong> When you go to an ATM machine, you touch buttons on its screen to indicate whether you want to deposit or withdraw. Here's how it "knows" what you want. Someone wrote a program that places those words&mdash;deposit and withdraw&mdash;somewhere on the screen. The program then <em>tests</em> to determine where you touch the screen or which button you press. The action the program takes next is conditional; it depends on what input you've given it with your touch. Another part of the program may test the size of the withdrawal you request and indicate if that is too large or not an amount it can give, or it may deliver that amount. Your smart phone's screen works a similar way. The program knows only where you touch, but because it also knows what word or picture it put in that location, it can "know what you want"&mdash;<code>if</code> you touch <em>here</em>, do one thing, <code>else</code> do something else. Distinguishing conditions and basing action on the distinction is central to all programming.</div>
        <p>Small projects focus especially on using multiple <code>if</code> statements to distinguish multiple conditions. Students design a program that tests to see whether "red," "yellow," or "green" has been typed, and sets a traffic signal to that color; they design another program to decide when to add <em>s</em> and when to add <em>es</em> to make the plural of a noun.</p>
		<p>This lab also re-emphasizes <strong>abstraction</strong>. Students <strong>analyze</strong> the complex task of correctly spelling plurals by breaking it into subtasks and creating blocks that specialize in these subtasks. They also practice reading and analyzing scripts they have not created, one particularly powerful way to learn to program similar behaviors. Debugging is an essential skill&mdash;especially as one's programs become more complex&mdash;but it takes time to acquire and hone that skill because there is no single formula or sub-skill for doing it well. This lab also begins to draw explicit attention to one aspect of debugging: deliberately trying to "break" a program, searching for ways that a user's input (or some other situation that arises) can cause a program to fail and accounting for those ways by testing for them and responding appropriately.</p>

                <li> This week contains two labs. Though they differ in page length, each will probably take roughly half the time you have available. </li>
                <li> The goal is for students to learn and succeed, not rush, and to have chances to  try some of the Take It Further problems and to be creative on their own. Plan accordingly, but... </li>
                <li>...if you notice that the first two pages of Lab 1 are taking longer than you had anticipated, consider doing <em>only</em> problems 1-3 on page 3 (Using Multiple <code>If</code> Statements) and skipping the rest of that page (problems 4 through 7).  There will be many other opportunities to work with multiple <code>if</code>s.</li>

        		<li>The Take-It-Further on the last page of this lab, <em>Plurals, continued</em>, foreshadows recursion, a powerful idea that students will study in Unit 6. Students develop  <code>plural</code> to spell the plural of an English noun, creating separate blocks for various special cases (nouns ending with s, x, h, y, and so on) and otherwise just appending <strong>s</strong>. Then they <em>fix</em> <code>plural</code> to handle a "word ending with a space" and use <code>plural</code>, itself, as the specialist to handle the word after that space has been removed. It may surprise them to see that this solution works even with "words" that end with many spaces.</li>

                <li>Analyze <em>tasks</em> to find subtasks that can be handled independently, develop blocks that specialize in each of the subtasks, and use conditionals to determine which of these specialist blocks to use.</li>

                <li>
                	To launch Lab 1 &mdash; <strong>Make a Prediction</strong>: Project these scripts and ask students to describe what they will do. Discuss in small groups and/or as a class. Students have seen similar things.<br />

        <h3>Assignments:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Copy the code shown below and run it. Add code so that the sprite changes color depending upon the quadrant that it is in, as shown. Then submit your code in whatever way your class uses.<br />
                    <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2L1-Assessment.png" target="_blank"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2L1-Assessment.png" alt="script that makes sprite draw around randomly" title="script that makes sprite draw around randomly" /></a>

                </li>
                <li>
                	Create three predicate blocks that take a word as input.
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>long word</code>: Returns <code>true</code> if the input word is longer than 8 letters, <code>false</code> otherwise.</li>
                        <li><code>short word</code>: Returns <code>true</code> if the input word is shorter than 4 letters, <code>false</code> otherwise.</li>
                        <li><code>favorite word</code>: Returns <code>true</code> if the input word is one of your five favorite words which you have entered into a list, <code>false</code> otherwise.</li>
                    </ul>
					Then write a script with this behavior: When the green flag is clicked, the sprite asks the user to enter a word. If the word is longer than 8 letters, it should then say, "That is a long word!" If the word is less than 4 letters, it should say, "That is a short word!" Finally, the sprite should say if the entered word is one of your favorite words. 
Submit your code in whatever way your class uses.

        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                	Be sure students understand that they are expected to read all the material presented and complete all the "For You To Do" problems with only the following exceptions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yellow boxes are optional reading.</li>
                        <li>"If There Is Time..." and "Take It Further" problems are not required. (These are provided for students to work on after finishing the required reading and problems. "If There Is Time..." problems are generally about as difficult as "For You To Do" problems, but "Take It Further" problems are often harder. If pairs have finished their assigned work, they can go head and start on some of these extra problems and don't have to wait for permission.)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
					<strong>Page 1: More Work with <code>If Else</code>.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>This page involves some pure experimentation (students use code to see what it does) and some puzzles. Some of the puzzles are hard. Let students know that if they've done the experiments, the playing around, they have most of the knowledge they need for the puzzles. But puzzles are puzzling! Try, tinker, try something new, talk to your partner. And if you still can't solve the puzzle yourself, that's ok. Talk to another group.</li>
						<li>Make sure that students don't skip over the "<em>figure out how it works</em>" part of problem 1.  The figuring out helps students do problems 2 and 3. It's probably not necessary to do anything formal with that "figure out" part&mdash;talking with the pair programmer is likely to be enough&mdash;but if you feel your students need  more structure, you might prepare a paper copy of the scripts for students to annotate, or some other way to make the results of problem 1 more tangible than discussion.</li>
                        <li>The second experiment from Problem 1 that has the sprite forever point in the direction of the mouse pointer is very useful for figuring out which direction the sprite should be pointing when it changes color and pen size.</li>
                        <li>
                        	<strong>Mathematics Notes:  Reporters.</strong> In <span class="snap">snap</span>, a <strong>reporter</strong> is block that returns a value. <strong>Why "reporter" instead of "function?"</strong>  
                        	<ul>
                        		<li>One reason for this vocabulary is that in mathematics, a function is defined by its output for a given input<!--, while in computer science, a function is defined by its...-->.  So, for example, the functions defined by <span class="katex"> x \mapsto 2(x+1)</span> and <span class="katex">x \mapsto 2x+2</span> are <em>equal as functions</em>. But they are <em>defined by different algorithms</em>, so we'd like to say that we have two reporters that define the same function.</li>
                                <li>
                                	In addition, we want to emphasize that reporters don't need to take a number as input and produce a number as output. (Neither do functions in mathematics, but many students will come to the course thinking that a function is always defined by an algebraic expression that accepts and returns numbers.) In this unit, an important kind of reporter is a <strong>predicate</strong>, which reports not a number but one of two values: <var>true</var> or <var>false</var>.  An example is the operator&nbsp;<code>&lt;</code>:<br />  
                                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/5lt7reporting-true.png" alt="5 < 7 reporting true" title="5 < 7 reporting true" />
                                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/10lt7reporting-true.png" alt="10 < 7 reporting true" title="10 < 7 reporting true" />
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                	One more reason: Some reporters don't define functions at all. An example is <code>pick random</code>:<br />
                                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/pick-random-1-to-10-reporting-2.png" alt="pick random 1 to 10 reporting 2" title="pick random 1 to 10 reporting 2"/><br />
                                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/pick-random-1-to-10-reporting-9.png" alt="pick random 1 to 10 reporting 9" title="pick random 1 to 10 reporting 9"/><br />
                                    Each time <code>pick random</code> <var>1</var> <code>to</code> <var>10</var> is called, it reports an integer between 1 and 10, and different calls will likely produce different results.  So, <code>pick random</code> reports an output that is <em>not uniquely defined</em> for given inputs as is required of mathematical functions.

					<strong>Page 2: Creating and Using Predicates.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Problem 1 uses a video to show how to create the <code>even?</code> block. You may prefer to demonstrate on a projector, have your students  watch you  and copy what you do in <span class="snap">snap</span>. That may be easier than having both the student guide and the <span class="snap">snap</span> page open on their machine. For the rest of the problems on the page, <em>avoid</em> demonstrating. Students will learn most by puzzling them out. Take-It-Further challenge B is especially worthwhile for students who have the time.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Mathematics Note: Using Predicates.</strong> It takes some time and experience for students to make use of the fact that predicates report a value, <var>true</var> or <var>false</var> (also called a "Boolean" value). So you might see some code that uses a predicate as a tester but doesn't directly report its output. The <code>even?</code> block for example, could be built like this:<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/even-block-definition-complex.png" alt="complex 'even?' block definition" title="complex 'even?' block definition" /><br />
                            The work, though, is already done by mod:<br />
                            <div class="sidenote">What would happen if a student just reported <var>n</var> <code>mod</code> <var>2</var>?</div>
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/even-block-definition-simple.png" alt="simple 'even?' block definition" title="simple 'even?' block definition" /><br />
                            (The word <em>Boolean</em> is after George Boole, a 19th century English mathematician who developed an algebra of logic, now called <em>Boolean Algebra,</em> in which the only values are <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.)

					<strong>Page 3: Using Lists to Write <code>Vowel?</code></strong>
					<ul>
						<li>This page previews lists, giving students a first experience using lists and list blocks in a simple context in their <code>vowel?</code> block and to test their <code>join "a" or "an" with</code> block. Students do not need to master lists or list blocks at this time. They will be covered in much greater depth in Unit 3.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mathematics Note: Lists.</strong> If you've plotted points on a coordinate grid, you've used the idea of an ordered pair of numbers. An ordered pair is an example of a <em>list</em>&mdash;in this case a piece of data that contains two items. In mathematics and in computer science, it's a useful abstraction to think of a list of objects as a single thing. List can be built up and manipulated in Snap<em>!</em>, using some primitive and user-built reporters. There are <em>constructors</em>, such as <code>list</code>, that let you build lists of any kinds of objects (including other lists) and there are <em>selectors</em>, such as <code>item</code>, that let you pull lists apart.</li>
                        <li>
                        	<strong>Mathematics Note: <code>Map</code>.</strong> Suppose you have a list of numbers and you want to produce the list of each of the numbers plus 2. You could do this with iteration, such as a <code>for</code> loop, or you could just <code>map</code> the function <span class="katex">x \mapsto x+2</span> over each element of the list. In Snap<em>!</em>, it looks like this:<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/map-plus2-over-list-reporting.png" alt="map ( () + (2) ) over {1, 4, 6, 0} reporting {3, 6, 8, 2}" title="map ( () + (2) ) over {1, 4, 6, 0} reporting {3, 6, 8, 2}" /><br />
                            This says "apply the function ‘add 2' to each element of the list." The utility of this construction is that you can change the function by changing the expression inside the gray ring. This begins the conceptual climb that students will make over the course of BJC: not only are lists data, but so are <em>reporters</em>. They can be inputs to and outputs from other reporters. This function-as-object idea is foundational to many advances in mathematics over the centuries and it's a hallmark of modern programing languages.

                        	<strong>Mathematics Note: Absolute Value.</strong> There are several equivalent ways to define absolute value. The one here&mdash;the distance between a number and 0 on the number line&mdash;is all students need for this lesson. In mathematics class, absolute value is often thought of as a formula that treats positive and negative numbers differently. That formulation isn't needed here. It might, however, be interesting for algebra students to write a Snap<em>!</em> block <code>abs</code> that implements this "piecewise" definition:<br />
                            <span class="katex-block">|x|=\begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0 \end{cases}</span>
                            Modeling this in Snap<em>!</em> can help students understand the mathematics.

					<strong>Page 5: Developing a Block That Makes Plurals.</strong>
					<ul>
                        <li>Students, even in high school, may have questions about what <em>is</em> the correct plural or correct way to spell it. Encourage them to  check with each other, but also feel free to ask you. Nobody can possibly think of all possible words anyway, so let students know that it is equally okay to ignore words that they're not yet sure about. One side benefit of this project is that it helps students notice how much they <em>do</em> know and take for granted, and how much work it is for a computer to do what humans do naturally! <em>Students may do this kind of activity in another language if they like. The Take It Further on page 4 suggests one such investigation. </em></li>

                            The following rule summaries are for <em>your</em> benefit. Don't teach them to students. The point is not for them to know the rules in advance but to discover them the way computational linguists do, by making a model, seeing if it works, and fixing it if it does not. You can contribute by debugging a specialist block they think they've finished by proposing a word that it might get wrong.
                            <ul>
                          <li><code>plural-h</code> needs to recognize words that end with <em>ch</em> and <em>sh</em> so that it can <code>join</code> <em>es</em> to those. To all other words (for example, ones that end with <em>th</em>) we just <code>join</code> <em>s</em>. To do this, <code>plural-h</code> must look at the next-to-last letter of the word. </li>
                                <li><code>plural-y</code> also needs to look at the next-to-last letter, in this case to see if it is a vowel. To words like <em>day</em> and <em>boy</em> with vowels before the <em>y</em>, we just <code>join</code> <em>s</em>. For the others, like <em>spy</em> and <em>fly</em>, we "change" the last letter (<em>y</em>) to <em>i</em> (by removing the <em>y</em> and using <code>join</code> to replace it with an <em>i</em>) and then <code>join</code> <em>es</em>. </li>

                    and ask students to describe the behavior they are seeing.<br />
                    You can expect that initial contributions will be fairly general&mdash;"The computer is writing the word 'mouse'" or even "It's writing in two colors." It's <em>sensible</em>  to start with the global behavior. Continue asking for contributions, that add more precision or detail: "It looks like  the writing changes to red when it gets to the top half of the screen" or "the sprite <em>and</em> the mouse are moving together" or....<br />
                    Observations like these help the student recognize what features might be needed in a <em>program</em> that can create this behavior.
