		<h2>Social Implications Lab 6: Encryption</h2>
		<p>The details of encryption get complicated, but the overall idea is important. All bits, whether they are from confidential information or not, pass through the Internet the same way. To keep information secret, we can use encryption, an idea that has been around for millennia. In this lab, students learn about encryption and decryption methods, both enabled by technology.</p>
        <p>Students also consider why encryption is considered an issue with social implications. They will engage in a debate activity in which they consider the viewpoints of governments, civil liberties groups, and businesses regarding the availability of encryption software. Students also have the opportunity to choose and research an innovation that is affected by issues around encryption (there are many to choose among). They will do some online research and respond to prompts taken from the AP Explore Task, which they will do following Unit 4 in the course.</p> 
		
        <h3>Pacing:</h3>
        <div>
            The 5 lab pages could be split across 4-5 days (<strong>255-295 minutes</strong>). The last page, when students do research and respond to AP Explore Task prompts, will probably take several days, especially if students engage in peer review.

        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 1: Secrets.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In this introduction to the topic, students write a short message and make up a cipher to encode it. Students will likely use a substitution cipher.</li>
                        <li>If students are able to decode the message, they might recognize patterns in the letters or frequency of certain letters. These observations are useful because they are exactly the observations used to break substitution codes. Students have already written decoders for codes in which they knew the encryption rule. They might think about how  a computer program might go about decoding messages that have been encoded with substitution codes when the coding rule is <em>not</em> already known.  </li>
                        <li>Students may not be able to decode the messages they got from their partners in this activity. Have them think about why having a longer message would have made it easier to decode.</li>
                        <li>Ask students to think: How might you encode a message so that people can't use, for example, the frequencies of letters to help them decode it?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 2: Secret Keys.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You may have already talked about the idea of substitution ciphers on the previous page</li>
                        <div class="sidenote">Students have likely never actually made a credit card purchase themselves online, so this idea may warrant some discussion.</div>
                        <li>A big idea on this page is the idea of a key, and that the need to deliver a key along with the encoded message is a major security risk. For the first For You To Do question, students might notice that, for a Caesar cipher, the messenger could just remember a number (like "4") and deliver this message with the text. For a substitution cipher, a messenger couldn't remember the whole key, and would have to convey that cipher somehow.</li>
                        <li>In the bottom half of the page, there is an image taken from <em>Blown to Bits</em>. Again, students are asked to think about this idea of a key. When you make an online purchase and send your credit card number, it would be unwise to send a key right along with it. And it is impractical to think that you would have pre-arranged to share a key with an online company before making the purchase.</li>
                        <div class="sidenote">You might suggest a student make a <span class="snap">snap</span> project related to Vigenere ciphers.</div>
                        <li>The Take It Further boxes include readings from <em>Blown to Bits</em> about other ciphers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 3: Public Keys.</strong>
					<ul>
                        <li>Students will read "Secrecy Changes Forever" from <em>Blown to Bits</em> to learn why public key encryption was such a novel and useful innovation.</li>
                        <li>Again, students should focus on the keys to make sense of the process. The reading and diagram provide the big picture idea. For students who are curious, the Take It Further reading contains more details.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 4: Who Cares about Encryption?</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students read sections of <em>Blown to Bits</em> to prepare for a debate activity about the availability of encryption software.</li>
                        <li>The student page suggests  a class discussion to help make sure that everyone is clear on the position that each of the three groups (governments, civil liberties groups, businesses) will take.</li>
                        <li>Depending on the size of the class, it may make sense to split into 6 groups or more, with multiple groups representing each position. Having more than one group per position can also add interest, by letting groups compare the reasons they thought made the most convincing arguments.</li>
                        <li>If you wish, you can make this into a more full-fledged debate. Visit the <a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/eba/" target="_blank">Boston Debate League</a> for resources, like <a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/All-Skills-Multi-Perspective-Debate.docx" target="_blank">this guide for a full-class multi-perspective debate</a>.</li>
                        <li>This can also be a simpler activity in which each group presents its case. Each group can first share its reasons for supporting its position. Then, the government and business groups can share their reason they are against the civil liberties position, and the civil liberties groups could have the opportunity to respond. Each position gets its turn to hear the reasons others are against its position and gets the opportunity to defend itself.</li>
                        <li>The Take It Further prompts include an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning through the debate activity.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 5: Cryptography and Innovations.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students choose an innovation that interests them. Many innovations have some issues regarding data security, even if it is not immediately obvious. Students might start with a topic that interests them, and then find a connection to cryptography that they did not expect.</li>
                        <li>The prompts are taken directly from the "Innovation" section of "B. Written Requirements." You might let students know that these aren't the only written requirements, and that they will also have to produce a visual artifact and a reference list for the AP Explore Task.</li>
                        <li>
                            Depending on how comfortable students are with writing assignments, you have several options for how to present this task.
                            <ul>
                                <div class="sidenote">Here's <a href="https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/student-writing-peer-review-nea" target="_blank">a video (Teaching Channel)</a> and <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/sweetland/Home/Downloads/UsingPeerReviewtoImproveStudentWriting.pdf" target="_blank">a written resource (from U.Michigan)</a> about peer review.</div>
                                <li>Students might be fine with the assignment as written and be able to write four paragraphs based on their independent research. They should do this, and then exchange their papers with a partner for a peer review.</li>
                                <li>Students could choose from the four prompts, perhaps responding to just one or two of them. This might help them focus their research and be easier to enter into. Students can then either find a partner who worked on the same prompts to hone their understanding of how best to respond to their particular prompts. Or, students might be paired with someone who responded to different prompts in order to see what other questions the task is asking students to write about.</li>
                                <li>If this is one of the first formal writing activities, you might have all students work on the first prompt, have students share their writing with each other, have a short class discussion, and then have students work on the rest of the prompts. This two-stage process can help students get a better sense of the expectations you have for their writing.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>After the writing activity, you might ask students to reflect on the process. Encourage students to be thinking of possible innovations they might want to write about in this way for the AP Explore Task.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
