                    <strong>Mathematics Note:</strong> The coordinate axes may be a challenge for some students. In the spirit of this first lab, it's not so important that students  understand the Snap<em>!</em> coordinate axes now, and if they don't, just have them follow the instructions literally: a random number between -190 and 190 for <var>x</var>, a random number between -130 and 130 for <var>y</var>. For your reference, here (at right) is the underlying 'anatomy' of the Snap<em>!</em> stage; this background image is available in Snap<em>!</em> by clicking the Stage icon and selecting "Backgrounds" from the File menu, then &quot;xy-grid.&quot;

            <h3>Tips:</h3>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Across Unit 3.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The words "item" and "element" have the same meaning. We use "item" here because that's the name of the block that examines an item in a list. You may want to favor that word, too.</li>
                            <li>In Snap<em>!</em>, the first item of a list is considered item number 1, not number 0 as in some other languages. We think this is clearly advantageous for learners: "the third item" and "item 3" should refer to the same thing. Zero-origin list indexing is a leftover from low-level languages that do arithmetic on array indices. It's fine if some student thinks zero-origin is "right," but feel free also to say that one design goal of computer language is to be clear, and this language (Snap<em>!</em>) is designed so that ordinals (first, second, third) and cardinals (1, 2, 3)  match.</li>
                            <li>We are encouraging functional programming style, which in this case means favoring the list reporters over the list commands. Make sure that students understand, for example, that <code>all but first of</code> makes a new list; the original list given as its input is not modified.</li>
                            <li>
                                One advantage of functional programming is that it avoids circular structures, which can be made by mutation:<br />
                                <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/circular.png" alt="replace item (3) of (foo) with (foo)" title="replace item (3) of (foo) with (foo)" /><br />This won't come up in the curriculum, but some students may try it anyway.  It won't break Snap<em>!</em>, but encourage such students to play with circularity on their own time.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>
            </div>
    
            
        </div>
        <p>The <code>list</code> block is the basic building block of many  complex structures. Lists can contain anything: numbers, strings, other lists, even blocks. The objects <em>in</em> a list can be all of the same kind or of different kinds. A list can, for example, contain an apartment number and a list of people at that address. The tabular data we see in spreadsheets can be represented as a list of same-length lists, the smaller lists representing each row in the table, and the enclosing list representing the entire spreadsheet.</p>
        <p> The "ordered pair" of algebra, the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) coordinates of a point on a plane, can be represented as a list of two numbers. Students will use a list of ordered pairs to draw a shape or plot a graph.</p>
        <p>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/A.png" alt="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" title="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" />

        </p>
        <p>In this lab, students also practice one kind of problem-decomposition, in the form of building a <em>simple</em> tool that solves a repetitive <em>part</em> of the problem, and then using it to solve the whole problem. </p>
        <p>
                On the first page of this lab, students are given a list of points, and they create a <code>go to point</code> block that moves the sprite to any <em>one point</em> given as input. <!--To select information in the dataset, we only need to know where it appears.--> Students can, for example, use <code>item (3) of </code> to access the third point, <var> {10, 120}</var>, and  use the code 
                <img class = "inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/go-to-point-item-3-of-A.png" height="45" alt="go to point(item(3) of (A))" title="go to point(item(3) of (A))"> 
                to move the sprite to that point. Having built a tool for getting to <em>one</em> point, students then use that tool and <em>automate</em> the process of getting to all the points, using  <code>for each</code>.
        </p>
		
        
        <p>
           Students will build the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point()().png" alt="point () ()" title="point () ()" />block and use it to replace <!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinate-list-for-A.png" height="54" alt="coordinate-list-for-A">-->the list for the letter A shown above with the list shown below.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point-list-for-A.png" height="82" alt="list{point(-50)(20); point(-10)(120);...; point(-20)(50); point(-30)(20)}" title="list{point(-50)(20); point(-10)(120);...; point(-20)(50); point(-30)(20)}">.
        </p>
        <p> The change seems trivial; everything works the same way (in fact,  <code>point</code> does exactly what <code>list</code> does, so the computer doesn't care which code is used). But the second version makes it easier for <em>humans</em> to write, read, and understand the code. Similarly, students also create <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/x-coordinate.png" alt="x coordinate of {}" title="x coordinate of {}" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/y-coordinate.png" alt="y coordinate of {}" title="y coordinate of {}" /> blocks to replace <code>item</code>, using abstraction again to clarify the <em>purpose</em> of the code and to distinguish it from the details. This process is called constructing an <strong>abstract data type</strong>—using <code>point</code> as a "constructor" to produce the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) coordinate pair (a list) from two individual coordinates, and "selectors" <code>x coordinate of</code> and <code>y coordinate of</code>. </p>
        <p>On the third page, students analyze and complete partially written code to let the programmer collect and store points in a list by clicking on the stage to indicate which points they want. </p>
        <p>On the last page, students automate that process to collect the vertices of a polygon in order to make a mandala design.</p>
        <div class="sidenoteBig">Many of the <span class="snap">snap</span> projects linked from the student pages already have the tools imported.</div>
        <!--<p>Students need to <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" /> each time they open a new <span class="snap">snap</span> window.</p>-->

                                <ul>
                                    <li>What is is the difference between a string and a list? (Students without prior programming experience may wonder, "what's <em>the same</em> between a string and a list?" The answer is that they're both aggregates. A string is an aggregate whose items are restricted to single characters; a list is an aggregate whose items can be anything.)</li>

                                    <li>What actions can you perform on a list? What can you use lists for? (Actions might be "add an item" or "order the items"; project ideas might be "track earnings and expenses" or "organize sports data.")</li>
                                    <li>What data types can be list items? Invite students to experiment with Snap<em>!</em> to answer this question and to consider contexts for which including various data types in a list would be useful. (A list can contain <em>any</em> data type  <em>anywhere</em>. Students will have seen only a limited set of values at this point.)</li>
                                    <li>Can you put a list in a list? (Yes, <em>any</em> data type <em>anywhere</em>.) What are some examples of a list within a list? (Students may not have examples just yet.) This is both a preview of the next lab, "Nesting Lists," and also an introduction to the idea that nesting computational objects is common in programming. </li>

                                    A common mistake is for programmers to create an initialization instruction (the <code>set</code> instruction) but forget to run it (e.g., actually click it). If students run into the following error, they need to run <code>set (shopping list) to (list)</code> to initialize the list.<br />

                        		<li><strong>The dialog</strong> has some complicated ideas. Arrange so that students  can read it through more than once (perhaps, individually, in small groups, as a &quot;dramatic reading&quot;....) For out loud reading, students are often more comfortable if they've had a chance to prepare first, so you might invite three students, as they enter class, to prepare to be Morgan, Jasmine, or Omar for today.</li>

                                <li><strong>Debugging: </strong>Have students first think about what goes in the two blanks inside the <code>go to point</code> script. Only after the letter is mostly being drawn correctly should they tackle the two bugs, one at the beginning and one at the end of the drawing process.</li>
                                
                                <li>Students who have programmed before in Scratch will be surprised about the use of lists (points) as inputs to a block, because Scratch doesn't allow that. You don't have to bring this up with the whole class, but if you get questions about it, you can just say that this is one of the ways that Snap<em>!</em> has extended Scratch.</li>
                                
								<li><strong>Specifying an input type</strong>: The information about is useful, but  not essential. Students may also find it faster and better to learn from you than by working through the page. Consider <em>demonstrating</em> with students  following along. </li>
								<li>Input types in Snap<em>!</em> are <em>program documentation,</em> not constraints on the programmer. You can drop any reporter into any input slot. The input slot shapes are just hints about what the block expects. Don't emphasize type checking. It's really important for a programmer to understand the domain and range of each function, but the domain (e.g., "an even positive integer" or "a word of no more than eight letters" or "a list whose items are either Booleans or lists") is often different from the language's types.</li>
                                <li><strong>Take It Further</strong>: Let students eyeball the three new points rather than worrying about precision. The goal here is to find a way to draw shapes that have disconnected parts, like the  A that has an inside triangle. Students might bundle the two separate parts (both lists of points) in a list-of-lists-of-points, or a might use a special pseudo-point that means &quot;pick the pen up before going to the next point.&quot; Some students might care to apply what they know about <em>slope</em> from algebra to identify the remaining points in the letter exactly and, for that matter, to correct the original list, which doesn't get it quite right!</li>
                                <li><strong>Mathematical Take-it-Further for interested students: Transforming Coordinates.</strong>  The list <strong>A</strong> contains the coordinates of the  points (<em>vertices</em>) that define the picture of the letter <em>A</em> in <em>that position</em> on the stage.  You can transform these coordinates to draw an exact replica of <em>A</em> in another spot on the stage. This can let you set two letters next to each other on the screen, or make a "shadow" of <em>A</em> or to draw an offset image to create a three-dimensional effect. Try creating a list <em>AA</em> from <em>A</em> by adding, say, 50 to each of the coordinates of each of the points and plotting the resulting points, with <code>for each</code>.</li>

                                	Discussion: After  students have worked through the dialog (and perhaps also added the abstract data type to their U3L2-DrawShape project), you might review with questions like these:
                                      <ul>
                                        <li>What are some benefits of creating an abstract data type?</li>
                                        <li>What's a <em>primitive</em> data type? What are some examples?</li>
                                        <li>What's an <em>abstract</em> data type? What are some examples?
                                          <ul>
                                            <li>In particular, what data in Unit 1 projects could be treated as abstract data types?</li>
                                          </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>What is the difference between a primitive data type and an abstract data type?</li>
                                    </ul>

                                <li>"Abstract data type" (or ADT) sounds like a complicated thing, but programmers actually use them to simplify <em>and clarify</em> the logical structure of their code. It is a thing to help <em>people</em>, not <em>machines</em>. An abstract data type is like a "template" for data. For example, a registration form on which individuals write their name, address, and email in a particular place helps us know where to look for each part of the data. </li>

                    	<p>The table below compares the &quot;ordinary language&quot; use of <em>abstract</em> with the CS use. (It's not about data abstraction specifically, but the major levels of abstraction in computer science generally.) </p>
                        <p> In ordinary language, the actual physical computer is the "least abstract" thing, because you can hold it in your hand, push its buttons, maybe take it apart.  In ordinary language, programming seems to deal with "more abstract" ideas, things with no visible, tangible existence. In some ways, the physical thing might seem easiest to think about, and the programming at the top of the table harder.</p>
                    	<p>Computer scientists use "abstract" to mean something more like "this is defined in terms of that": application software is written in a high level language, which is itself implemented in a low level language.  It's <em>easier</em> to understand a language than to deal with all the details—how the language is built from lower level languages, and how they work with the computer architecture, and how that's built of transistors, which depend on the behavior of electrons, and so on. From that perspective, things get harder as you move down the table.  It's easy to write a program in Snap<em>!</em>, harder to write one in C, because you have to think about more details of memory management.  It's easier to understand the design of a computer architecture (the Intel Core design, for example) than to understand the physical circuits that implement it.</p>

                	<strong>Page 3: Capturing Clicks to Draw.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Knowing how to get a program to add a point to a list. On this page, the user clicks on a point, and the program adds <em>that point</em> to the list. This  prepares students for page 4, a program generates a list of points  automatically.  </li>
								<li>The page also reinforces the idea of data abstraction. On page 2, students created an ADT and used it to rewrite a program they'd already written. It's hard to make that convincing, but here they are writing entirely new code that's much easier because of the <code>point</code> abstraction.</li>
								<li>(Minor) This page also introduces the primitive <code>stamp</code> to draw a picture of the sprite at its current location on the stage.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>Focus mainly on learning how to write code that collects points into a list. Fancy touches, such as visual details, are optional but not important.</li>
								<li>Students may initially think that <code>stamp</code> "didn't work"; you can't see the effect until the sprite moves away  because the picture looks exactly like the sprite and is in exactly the same place. </li>
								<li>The following hints apply, not to the version in the main curriculum, but to the alternate version suggested in the Take It Further section:
								  <ul style="color:#404040">
								    <!--<li><strong>The following is a problem only in spring 2017 during some teacher workshops; it will be fixed before students see this page. </strong>There is a Snap<em>!</em> bug that prevents saving to the cloud a project with a name made of non-ASCII characters, such as the script letters in the <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/stuff-here.png" alt="stuff here"> block. There are two workarounds: (1) replace the script words with plain letters; (2) use "export project" instead This will be an issue only until the page has been finished, at which point the <code>you write</code> block should no longer be used anywhere and can be deleted.</li>-->
								    <li>Some students may object to making <code>list of points</code> a reporter, because the shape is already drawn when it finishes running -- why do we need to keep the list of point? Remind them that they might want to draw a letter <em>more than once,</em> as part of a message, for example.</li>
								    <li>Experienced Scratch programmers, who have seen primitive reporters but have not been able to write their own before, may note that the primitive reporters don't <em>do</em> anything visible, but instead <em>only</em> report a value. <code>List of blocks</code> carries on an interaction and draws on the stage before finally reporting a value. They may find this surprising, but it's not a problem or breaking a rule.</li>

					<strong>Page 4: Mandala Design.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Apply everything learned in this lab in an artistic context.</li>
                                <li>Gain experience in breaking a somewhat large and difficult task into smaller manageable parts.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This page relies on the successful mastery of lists of points, as developed in the previous three pages.</li>
								<li>It may be helpful for students to hand draw a five-sided version of the Mandala to get a feel how the algorithm might work.</li>
