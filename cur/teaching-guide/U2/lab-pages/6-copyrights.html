        <h2>Lab 6: Copyrights</h2>
        <p>Software patents are controversial. In the US, software was generally not patentable until a 1981 Supreme Court decision. Students explore what it means to invent something, and why software might or might not be considered differently from machinery. The simultaneous invention of the telephone by several people is used as an example to debunk the apple-on-head, flash-of-insight myth.</p>
        <p>The digital storage of information makes the marginal cost of a perfect copy zero. In principle, that shouldn't affect the rights of artists, but in practice, many people feel free to copy media both for their own use and to give to friends. When classes are polled on this topic, most or all hands go up  for both "who thinks it's wrong to pirate music or movies" and for "who has pirated music or movies?" This is a springboard into a class discussion of how laws have changed, how artists should be supported, and the use of encryption to enforce copyright.</p>

        <h3>Prepare</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>You might ask students to look into news for current articles on copyrights.</li>
                <li>Although students are not directly assigned this reading, you might read <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=213" target="_blank" title="Blown to Bits: Balance Toppled, Who Owns the Bits?">Chapter 6 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a>. In particular, <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=213" target="_blank" title="Blown to Bits: Automated Crimes—Automated Justice">"Automated Crimes-Automated Justice" (pages 195-199)</a> is about the music industry's tactic of filing lawsuits against individuals for piracy. <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=231" target="_blank" title="Blown to Bits: Forbidden Technology">"Forbidden Technology" (pages 213-218)</a> addresses the anti-circumvention provision of the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act).</li>
                <li>These pages have a lot of reading. Depending on your class, you might create groups, assign each group a page to study and discuss, and then have a second day for reporting to the whole class, or you might do more in depth work on each page.  Note: Pages 1 and 2 are background information to inform the deeper discussion on pages 3 and 4.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Lab Pages</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Page 1: Copyright.</strong>
					<ul>

							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Consider their own beliefs and behaviors regarding copyright.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Be careful about the language you use. Words like "pirate" prejudge the issues; point out to the class that advocates for both sides of controversial issues try to set the terms for the debate. In particular in BJC, we avoid the term "intellectual property," which makes an analogy to real property and, as explained on page 3 (The Social Bargain), distorts the original purpose of copyrights.</li>
                                <li>An additional or alternative curriculum resource is <a href="http://teachingcopyright.org" target="_blank" title="Teaching Copyright">Teaching Copyright</a>, from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).</li>
                                <!--GONE? MF, 2/6/17 
                                <li>Don't overlook the comparison at the bottom of the page between copyright and the idea of "cheating" in school; it might make the issues more understandable to students.</li>-->
                				<li>Your students may find some of these topics particularly compelling.  Depending on the style and interests of your classroom, these might be approached as discussions, formal debates, or a short written position statement. Deliberately supporting opposing positions can help a class see that the issues are complex.</li>
								<li>Here is a prompt for class discussion or a writing assignment: <strong>Do you think everyone who illegally downloads music or movies deserves to be prosecuted?</strong> Students have likely encountered this issue directly in their lives. Students begin to form an argument to support a position. Later in the class, students will receive more information about the issue and engage in a short debate.</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>

							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                        		<li>This discussion of the social bargain is at the heart of understanding the issues regarding copyrights and patents. The text from the US Constitution makes the bargain clear both by explaining the <em>purpose</em> of copyrights and patents ("to promote the progress of science and useful arts") and the <em>limited term</em> that is crucial to achieving that purpose.  This is the standard by which all issues in this area should be judged.  (The actual text is, of course, US-specific, but the same principle is found in other countries' legal traditions also.)</li>

					<strong>Page 4: Copyrights and Computers.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Consider the impact of technology on issues of copyright</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>This is the first time computer-specific copyright issues appear. The fact that computers can make <em>perfect</em> copies at <em>zero</em> marginal cost has destroyed what were previously important "natural" protections for copyright holders and has made individual movie and music fans significant threats to them.  The widely-hated Digital Rights Management software can be understood as a response to this threat, not merely as a power grab (although it's that too).  "Marginal cost" is an unfamiliar term to students, but the idea is easy: it costs a lot of money to produce a movie or a song recording in the first place, but it costs nothing to make one more copy.</li>
                                <li>Note that, at least for sound recordings, the marginal cost has always been low.  It's been estimated that the manufacturing cost for one CD is about three cents.  But that's true only if you own a CD factory; burning a CD on your home computer costs more than that (for the blank CD).  What's new is that <em>anyone</em> can reproduce a recording at no cost and distribute it over the Internet at zero marginal cost. (You pay for Internet access, but generally not for each individual transmission.)</li>

							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                        		<li>The DMCA is specifically mentioned in the CSP Framework, and students are to understand that it has been both "a benefit and a challenge" (EK 7.3.1P); consider assigning a web search to find its alleged benefits.</li>

			<h4>Enduring Understandings:</h4>
			<div class="todo">Last year also included EU 7.1, EU 7.2 and not 7.3. Not sure what's right... --MF, 6/1/17</div>
            <p>Students consider benefits, historical contexts, and practical issues of innovations (<strong>EU 7.3</strong>, <strong>EU 7.4</strong>). This lab builds toward these EUs by examining how the creative process is affected by copyright laws surrounding the products of creativity. Students are required to struggle with their ideas about the nature of invention and the way in which creators depend on their social context, including earlier creative works. They also explore how computers and the Internet have affected the distribution of creative works and the implications for creators.</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><strong>EU 7.3</strong> Computing has global effects &mdash; both beneficial and harmful &mdash; on people and society.</li>
                <li><strong>EU 7.4</strong> Computing innovations influence and are influenced by the economic, social, and cultural contexts in which they are designed and used.</li>
