		<h3>Pacing</h3>
		<div>
			Expected times to complete each optional project follow, but these times will vary significantly depending on your students:
			<ul>
				<li>30-40 minutes (about 1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/optional-projects/1-magic8ball.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Automated Fortune Teller</a></li>
				<li>40-60 minutes (1-2 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/optional-projects/2-egyptian-motif.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Egyptian Motif</a></li>
				<li>X-X minutes (X-X class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/optional-projects/3-mastermind.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Mastermind</a></li>
				<li>40-60 minutes (1-2 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/optional-projects/4-tic-tac-toe.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Tic Tac Toe Using Sprites</a></li>

				<li>
					<strong>Page 1: Automated Fortune Teller.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>This less difficult project aims to build more experience in using the <em>list</em> data structure.  If exciting costumes and sounds are incorporated, the project can become very creative and engaging.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
                <li>
					<strong>Page 2: Egyptian Motif.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>This step-by-step project aims to develop intuition about the concept of a <em>variable</em> in the context of Islamic artistic design.  The project ties directly to Unit 1 Lab 3 where <code>pinwheel</code> and <code>rectangle</code> blocks were developed.  It could be recommended to students with an interest in art and the Islamic culture.  A great reference for your students is "Visual Modeling with Logo" by James Clayson (MIT Press).</li>

							<strong>Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
                            	<li>Explore programming in the context of game design.</li>
								<li>Build the first phase of a large program with multiple levels of abstraction.</li>
								<li>Learn about the advantages of using the "cloning" feature of Snap<em>!</em> as an alternative to creating and keeping track of multitudes of sprites with identical properties and behaviors.</li>
                                
                                <li>Learn how to use nesting of looping blocks to create a grid of objects.</li>
                                <li>Gain dexterity in game programming on the way to developing a game AI (Artificial Intelligence.)</li>
							</ul>

                        	<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                            	<li>Phase 1 of the Tic Tac Toe game is a rather simple implementation of the Human versus Human game.  It may be a good idea to give the students an <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/new/6-newTTT-overview.html">overview</a> of the three phases of the project, so they have a sense of direction for the overall project.</li>-->
                        		<li>Based on the feedback we received from previous years, this year we wanted to give an alternative approach to the Tic Tac Toe project in which <em>all</em> the tedious math is gone and the programmers can focus on the game itself and ultimately explore interesting avenues for the game such as developing simple Artificial Intelligence (AI) to implement a Human versus Computer game in Phase 3 of the project. In this new version of the Tic Tac Toe, the squares of the Tic Tac Toe board are <strong><em>click-conscious </em></strong> sprites, thus eliminating the need for extensive mathematical computations to link mouse click locations to board cell numbers.  Even though this approach to Tic Tac Toe will be optional, we hope that you and your students will consider it and take on the challenge of creating something quite profound like Artificial Intelligence (AI) at this first course in Computer Science.</li>
                               <!-- <li>Most students will find the use of "cloning" initially challenging and may not even understand at first why it is being used.  Be sure to have them study the <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2-CloningExample.xml">"cloning example"</a> given thoroughly and complete the task given there (making rows of Alonzo clones) prior to moving on with Tic Tac Toe.  Motivate the use of "cloning" as a speedy alternative to creating and keeping track of 9 individual square sprites making up the game board.</li>
                                <li>When using clones in Snap<em>!</em> it is essential that the program is terminated by pressing the red stop button (next to the green flag.)  Otherwise, clones created during a previous run will not be deleted and in the next press of the green flag, these clones may end up creating their own clones, exponentially growing the size of the clone population and leading to undesired effects.  This point is made in a comment in the <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2-CloningExample.xml">"cloning example"</a> but may need to be emphasized.</li>
                                <li>Students may need some help understanding the use of the <code>mod</code> operator in determining whether a number is odd or even.  Remind them that <code>mod</code> is simply a "remainder" reporter when the first input is divided by the second.  Give them some examples such as: 7 <code>mod</code> 2 equals 1, because, the remainder when 7 is divided by 2 is 1. 6 <code>mod</code> 2 equals 0, because, the remainder when 6 is divided by 2 is 0. </li>-->
