                        		<li>The context is one example of Islamic artistic design, which requires that the art be based in pure forms, not images of nature.</li>
                        		<li>The project ties directly to Unit 1 Lab 3 where <code>pinwheel</code> and <code>rectangle</code> blocks were developed.  It could be recommended to students with an interest in art or Islamic culture.  You and your students may find <em>Visual Modeling with Logo</em> by James Clayson (MIT Press) an inspiring reference.</li>

                    <ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
                        		<li>Use <strong>parallelism</strong> and <strong>inter-sprite communication</strong> to display each color, which is handled by a separate sprite. These are steps toward object-oriented programming, about which students who take the AP CS A will learn more next year.</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
                       			<li>Understand that there <em>are</em> often very different ways to solve a problem.</li>
                        		<li>Appreciate the important CS concept of &quot;parallelism,&quot;&mdash;the fact that multiple processes can be running at the same time (in this case, multiple sprites remaining simultaneously &quot;aware&quot; and waiting for a click).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                        		<li>Later when students extend Tic Tac Toe to check for legal moves, to check for wins, and ultimately to  have the machine play competently, the machine will need to keep a record of each move. The approach in Lab 4 required the programmer to design a way to sense where on the screen a player moved; in this alternative version, the squares of the Tic Tac Toe board are <strong><em>click-conscious </em></strong> sprites, thus eliminating the need for the programmer to compute the board cell numbers from the coordinates of the mouse click.  This approach takes advantage of a capability of Snap<em>!</em> that is not in all programming languages&mdash;clones&mdash;a sophisticated and valuable abstraction that  simplifies the programmer's task in languages that provide it.</li>

							<strong>Goals:</strong>

                            	<li>Explore programming in the context of game design.</li>
								<li>Build the first phase of a large program with multiple levels of abstraction.</li>
								<li>Learn about the advantages of using the "cloning" feature of Snap<em>!</em> as an alternative to creating and keeping track of multitudes of sprites with identical properties and behaviors.</li>
                                
                                <li>Learn how to use nesting of looping blocks to create a grid of objects.</li>
                                <li>Gain dexterity in game programming on the way to developing a game AI (Artificial Intelligence.)</li>

                        <li>
                        	<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                            	<li>Phase 1 of the Tic Tac Toe game is a rather simple implementation of the Human versus Human game.  It may be a good idea to give the students an <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/new/6-newTTT-overview.html">overview</a> of the three phases of the project, so they have a sense of direction for the overall project.</li>-->

                               <!-- <li>Most students will find the use of "cloning" initially challenging and may not even understand at first why it is being used.  Be sure to have them study the <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2-CloningExample.xml">"cloning example"</a> given thoroughly and complete the task given there (making rows of Alonzo clones) prior to moving on with Tic Tac Toe.  Motivate the use of "cloning" as a speedy alternative to creating and keeping track of 9 individual square sprites making up the game board.</li>
                                <li>When using clones in Snap<em>!</em> it is essential that the program is terminated by pressing the red stop button (next to the green flag.)  Otherwise, clones created during a previous run will not be deleted and in the next press of the green flag, these clones may end up creating their own clones, exponentially growing the size of the clone population and leading to undesired effects.  This point is made in a comment in the <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2-CloningExample.xml">"cloning example"</a> but may need to be emphasized.</li>
                                <li>Students may need some help understanding the use of the <code>mod</code> operator in determining whether a number is odd or even.  Remind them that <code>mod</code> is simply a "remainder" reporter when the first input is divided by the second.  Give them some examples such as: 7 <code>mod</code> 2 equals 1, because, the remainder when 7 is divided by 2 is 1. 6 <code>mod</code> 2 equals 0, because, the remainder when 6 is divided by 2 is 0. </li>
                            </ul>
