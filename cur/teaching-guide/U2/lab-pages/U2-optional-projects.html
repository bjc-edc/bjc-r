								<li>Language processing has been one of the classic challenges and stunning successes of computer science. Forty years ago, the idea of a robot like Siri or Amazon Echo that could listen to someone speak, could recognize the words, and could respond usefully was complete science fiction. Computer scientists were certainly working to make it non-fiction, but nothing like it existed. Computers could not even make useful sense out of printed text, let alone spoken words. Today, we almost take tools like that for granted.</li>
								<li>The reason for mentioning this is that even this small language processing task, though well within the students' capabilities, is challenging. Students analyze the relevant data (words) to find patterns; they subdivide the problem according to those patterns; they use “specialists” to solve specific parts of a problem; and they coordinate those specialized procedures into a solution to the task. The computer science involved is problem decomposition and abstraction.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Students, even in high school, may have questions about what is the correct plural or correct way to spell it. Encourage them to check with each other, but also feel free to ask you. Or just ignore words that they're not yet sure about. One side benefit of this project is that it helps students notice how much they do know and take for granted, and how much work it is for a computer to do what humans do naturally! <em>Students may do this kind of activity in another language if they like. The Take It Further suggests one such investigation. It does not scaffold that investigation, but the reasoning and programming are nearly identical. Students might begin with the experiments and, once they know how the Snap! blocks work, skip to the language of their choice instead of doing English plurals.</em> </li>

								<li>The following rule summaries are for your benefit. Don't teach them to students. The rules, themselves, are of no importance. The point of this project is for students to analyze the data they have to discover regularities in it the way computational linguists do, by making a model, seeing if it works, and fixing it if it does not. Here are some things the specialists must do:<br />
                                <ul>
                                <li><strong>plural-h</strong> needs to recognize words that end with ch and sh so that it can join es to those. To all other words (for example, ones that end with th) we just join s.  To do this, <strong>plural-h</strong> must look at the next-to-last letter of the word.</li>
                                <li><strong>plural-y</strong> also needs to look at the next-to-last letter, in this case to see if it is a vowel. To words like <em>day</em> and <em>boy</em> with vowels before the <em>y</em>, we just <strong>join</strong> <em>s</em>. For the others, like <em>spy</em> and <em>fly</em>, we remove the y and use <strong>join</strong> to replace it with an <em>i</em> and <em>es</em>.</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                
                                </li>
								
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>You can best contribute to their debugging of a specialist block they think they've finished just by asking if they have tried hard to find a word that it gets wrong.</li>

					<strong>Page 4: Tic-Tac-Toe Using Sprites.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
                       			<li>Understand that there <em>are</em> often very different ways to solve a problem.</li>
                        		<li>Appreciate the important CS concept of &quot;parallelism,&quot;&mdash;the fact that multiple processes can be running at the same time (in this case, multiple sprites remaining simultaneously &quot;aware&quot; and waiting for a click).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                        		<li>Later when students extend Tic Tac Toe to check for legal moves, to check for wins, and ultimately to  have the machine play competently, the machine will need to keep a record of each move. The approach in Lab 4 required the programmer to design a way to sense where on the screen a player moved; in this alternative version, the squares of the Tic Tac Toe board are <strong><em>click-conscious </em></strong> sprites, thus eliminating the need for the programmer to compute the board cell numbers from the coordinates of the mouse click.  This approach takes advantage of a capability of Snap<em>!</em> that is not in all programming languages&mdash;clones&mdash;a sophisticated and valuable abstraction that  simplifies the programmer's task in languages that provide it.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
                        <li>
							<strong>Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
                            	<li>Explore programming in the context of game design.</li>
								<li>Build the first phase of a large program with multiple levels of abstraction.</li>
								<li>Learn about the advantages of using the "cloning" feature of Snap<em>!</em> as an alternative to creating and keeping track of multitudes of sprites with identical properties and behaviors.</li>
                                
                                <li>Learn how to use nesting of looping blocks to create a grid of objects.</li>
                                <li>Gain dexterity in game programming on the way to developing a game AI (Artificial Intelligence.)</li>

                        <li>
                        	<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                            	<li>Phase 1 of the Tic Tac Toe game is a rather simple implementation of the Human versus Human game.  It may be a good idea to give the students an <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/new/6-newTTT-overview.html">overview</a> of the three phases of the project, so they have a sense of direction for the overall project.</li>-->

                               <!-- <li>Most students will find the use of "cloning" initially challenging and may not even understand at first why it is being used.  Be sure to have them study the <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2-CloningExample.xml">"cloning example"</a> given thoroughly and complete the task given there (making rows of Alonzo clones) prior to moving on with Tic Tac Toe.  Motivate the use of "cloning" as a speedy alternative to creating and keeping track of 9 individual square sprites making up the game board.</li>
                                <li>When using clones in Snap<em>!</em> it is essential that the program is terminated by pressing the red stop button (next to the green flag.)  Otherwise, clones created during a previous run will not be deleted and in the next press of the green flag, these clones may end up creating their own clones, exponentially growing the size of the clone population and leading to undesired effects.  This point is made in a comment in the <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/2-complexity/U2-CloningExample.xml">"cloning example"</a> but may need to be emphasized.</li>
                                <li>Students may need some help understanding the use of the <code>mod</code> operator in determining whether a number is odd or even.  Remind them that <code>mod</code> is simply a "remainder" reporter when the first input is divided by the second.  Give them some examples such as: 7 <code>mod</code> 2 equals 1, because, the remainder when 7 is divided by 2 is 1. 6 <code>mod</code> 2 equals 0, because, the remainder when 6 is divided by 2 is 0. </li>
                            </ul>
