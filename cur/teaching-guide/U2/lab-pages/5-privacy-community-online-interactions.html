        <h2>Social Implications Lab 5: Privacy; Community and Online Interactions</h2>
        <div class="todo">
        	<ul>
                <li>GH Feedback 9/14/15: Would it be possible to incorporate a little typography into the text? Bring in some colors and boldness to make it more readable? Sometimes the text just bleeds together and is difficult to read.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 9/14/15: Where is this "Assignments<br />Reading: Addicted to Apps (NY Times)<br />Writing Prompts:" located on the student page?</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 9/14/15: You have the Four Corners activity linked but not the jigsaw.? Linking all of the activities with additional resources would be more helpful.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>In the first part of this lab, students think about the information that is available online about them, discuss why privacy is good to protect, and consider reasons for giving up that privacy. The <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading is about innovations all around us that collect data about us. Students then examine communications technology and discuss ways in which computing affects our ability to build community. Finally, students end by learning about cyberbullying: why people bully, how computing affects the nature and seriousness of bullying, and how social decisions about technology (such as sites devoted to anonymous posting) affect the issue.</p>
		<p>Privacy is a major issue when considering the social implications of computing. Students should learn how they can best protect their online privacy, but must also learn that threats to privacy are a social construct, not a law of nature, and that they <em>shouldn't have to</em> worry so much about privacy. (This is a general point about teaching social implications: Don't make it a "computer ethics" course in which grownups tell kids what to do. Instead, it's more about how technology should be regulated in the interest of users.)</p>
		<p>Discussing cyberbullying also gets students to think about how the Internet can bring out the worst in people. This is a serious discussion about a potentially personal and sensitive topic, and is an opportunity to reinforce your classroom as a safe space to pursue these topics.</p>
    	<p>Different modes of communication is a topic on the AP exam. They will only begin learning about how these technologies work in this Lab. What they learn now will make more sense as they learn more about how the Internet works.</p>

        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div class="classIndent">
            <h4>Getting Started</h4>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look at the "interesting resources" on the student page (<a href="https://prezi.com/lc8exztol608/oh-the-places-you-and-your-data-will-go/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy">prezi</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xb34Z7-vdKjdfanIK2vMFpVK5KmCCuYwocDXlD5qpn0/edit#slide=id.p">powerpoint</a>) to see if you might want to use these during class.</li>
                    <li>It's not recommended students spend class time trying to acquire data about themselves through acxiom.com.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Examining Privacy</h4>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are three For You To Do problems. It probably works best to use these problems in a whole-class discussion. You may choose to assign problem 3 as an individual writing assignment, after which students share their responses.</li>
                    <li>
                        Here are some possible answers to problem 2:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Government threats to privacy are the easiest to see, especially in the post-Snowden era. It's important for students to understand that these threats aren't new; that's why the Constitution prohibited unwarranted search or seizure over 200 years ago. On the other hand, they should also understand how dramatically government behavior changed after 9/11. Besides the NSA and the police agencies, government threats include the IRS and more obscure data collection. For example, sales of real estate are public records, and often include Social Security numbers. This wasn't so important when you had to visit the county clerk's office to search the records, but now they're online.</li>
                            <li>The corporate threats everyone talks about are Google and Facebook. But the sharing of information among banks and credit bureaus is equally problematic. Internet Service Providers read the data you send or receive over the net. You can use DuckDuckGo for your web searches instead of Google, but it's hard to avoid using either the phone company or the cable company as your ISP (or your ISP's ISP). A loophole in the laws preventing national police data collection allows the police to buy the data from private companies that do the collection for them.</li>
                            <li>Smartphone owners can record video in public places. This has given rise to a culture of shaming. That can be a good thing when police brutality is documented by a passerby, but incidents like the widespread harassment of "<a href="http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/the_tale_of_dog_poop_girl_is_n.php">Dog Poop Girl</a>" are troubling. (Since that first example, there have been several more online posting of videos of other dog poop violators.)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Footprints and Fingerprints</h4>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading should be done as a jigsaw. Each student will read their two sections carefully. Then they will share the key points from their sections, teaching the other students in their group.</li>
                    <li>Be aware that "Connecting the Dots" is the longest section to read, and in some ways the hardest, because it's not about a specific innovation, but about the idea that "de-identified" data might not be as secure as one might think.</li>
                    <li>Problem 3 asks students to read information about "How Sites Know Who You Are." Students will learn more about how the Internet works in future Labs. Students are not expected to master the idea of IP addresses now, but are being exposed to the terms.</li>
                    <!--<li><strong>Snap Judgment:</strong> Agree or disagree and why: People under the age of 18 should not be allowed to participate on social networking sites.</li>-->
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Communication and Community</h4>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Problem 2 asks students to conduct online research. As students work, make sure they visit more than one site to get their information.</li>
                    <li>The Take It Further video is not meant to be elaborate, but is a way to help students process what they learned in their online research. By having to explain it, they may come to understand what they read more clearly.</li>
                    <li>Problem 3 introduces two new topics. The statements "Computers are isolating" and "Computers are democratizing" will likely need to be explained to students. This <a href="/bjc-r/img/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/isolating-democratizing.pptx" target="_blank">powerpoint about community</a> is a resource for you (you may share it with students if you wish) that gives examples of why/why not computers are isolating and why/why not computers are democratizing. Student discussions will be much better if you present at least some of these examples before they take positions.</li>
                    <li>This <a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Four-Corners-Narrative.pdf" target="_blank">Four Corners activity description</a> is taken from the Boston Debate League.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Cyberbullying</h4>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>There's only one socially acceptable position on bullying, but clearly not everyone agrees with it, or there wouldn't be any bullies. So this is a discussion in which you'll have to be especially careful to protect students' right to disagree. You're unlikely to hear a blanket defense of bullying, but, for example, some students may feel that retaliatory bullying (bullying the bully) is okay. Others may feel that if the First Amendment protects Nazi and KKK rallies, it should also protect cyberbullying. Bend over backward to make room for these opinions in the discussion.</li>
                    <li>Have students work in small groups for 10-15 minutes researching the issue of cyberbullying online.</li>
        <!--            <div class="sidenote">More support for <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/discussion.html" target="_blank">Facilitating Classroom Discussions</a></div>-->
                    <li>
                        Students will engage in a 25-30 minute discussion. There are three parts to this discussion:
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>
                                Share some of the findings from the online research on the question: <em>What are some different forms that cyberbullying can take?</em> Students can share stories they found or different definitions of cyberbullying.
                                <!--<ul>
                                    <li>Possible follow-up question: Did anyone find themselves re-thinking their Snap Judgment response from the beginning of class?</li>
                                </ul>-->
                            </li>
                            <li>Next, discuss: <em>What are some possible ways to effectively address this issue?</em> Students may choose to focus on what they can do individually, what they should think should happen in schools, or what should be done at a societal level.</li>
                            <li>Finally, discuss: <em>What are the challenges to addressing cyberbullying?</em> For example, students may raise First Amendment rights, privacy issues regarding their communication, or the ability to assume other identities or operate anonymously online.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <!--<li>
                        <strong>Snap Judgment:</strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bQVpIWKUlYonoGchEU1nfeIGtUek8h3amzg9JbVeASU/edit?usp=sharing"><strong>What is cyberbullying?</strong></a><br />
                        Students have likely heard of or even experienced some form of cyberbullying. In <em>Blown to Bits</em>, they will later read a story (page 16) about a student who committed suicide after hurtful comments were aimed at her online. While students generally agree that such tragedies should not occur, they likely differ about their definition of what should be considered cyberbullying. Later, they will engage in a class discussion about possible ways to address cyberbullying. This Snap Judgment is meant to help students clarify for themselves what they mean when they think of "cyberbullying."
