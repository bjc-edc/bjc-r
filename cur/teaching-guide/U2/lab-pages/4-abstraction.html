        <h2>Programming Lab 4: Abstraction</h2>
        <p>Students begin with a drawing project, "Brick Wall,"  then build a complex number-guessing game (which they will extend and improve significantly in a later unit), and finally take another step toward completing Tic Tac Toe (and other  games played on arrays). In each case, they  focus  on ideas of <strong>abstraction</strong> to serve the goals or writing clear, debuggable, improvable code—essential for developing complex programs. This is not the first time they used abstraction—they encountered it when they first built the game board for Tic Tac Toe (and other games) and when they built "specialist blocks" for making plurals. But this <em>is</em> where they begin to analyze the various uses of abstraction, for example, a case in which it is useful to build a  block that seems only to be a new name for a block they already have.</p>
		<p>Students are given very specific goals for Brick Wall, guidance on <em>structuring</em> it, and rationale for that structure. For the number-guessing-game, they are again given suggestions for features to add, one at a time, but are on their own to think about how to structure these extensions and modifications so that the code works and remains clear.</p>
        <p>There is no new Snap<em>!</em> code in Lab 4. Even the idea of abstraction—analyzing a task to find its chunks or component parts or special cases and then build blocks that <em>specialize</em> in each of them—is not new. But making a <em>habit</em> of analyzing and chunking tasks takes time and experience.</p>

						<li>This involves the simplest coding of the three projects, but contains a <strong>key idea</strong> about abstraction. The suggestion to create a <code>draw mortar</code> block is important. It shows how editing <em>one</em> block can update a program in many places. Also, although the coding is simple, figuring out how to make row B's length come out right requires thought.</li>

                        <li>The <code>move to tile</code> block may be the greatest challenge. Students  may need your help  puzzling through the logic and mathematics of this problem. Discuss how to use <code>mod</code>  (introduced in <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/4-grids-for-games/2-computer-operations.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 1 Lesson 4, Expressions and Operations</a>) to determine the column from the tile number. <code>(tile number) mod (number of tiles)</code><em>almost</em> does the right thing. Encourage students to <em>experiment</em> to see what case(s) it gets wrong and what adjustment to make.

                This  is the most complicated project in units 1 and 2, but students are given enough subtasks to make it likely that, <em>working together</em>, they can succeed. Working together is key. Some will figure out how to solve certain parts, and others will figure out how to solve other parts. Sharing, they will learn from each other.</li>
				<li>
                	<em>What do I do when a student asks how to solve a problem?</em> There will almost certainly be parts of some of these projects that <em>you</em> don't quickly see how to do. But even when you <em>do</em> know how to solve the problem, the most useful answer you can give is often one of these
                    <ol> 
                        <li>Show me what you've already figured out.</li>
                        <li>What are the <em>parts</em> of the problem that need to be built? </li>
                        <li>Is there a good starting place (or a thing to do next), something really simple that will get us a bit closer?</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
				<li>To avoid overloading the text, the orange box about abstraction doesn't  mention  that even building the board out of boxes is an abstraction-based design decision. That's not how you draw a tic-tac-toe board by hand; you draw long intersecting lines. We could have done that here, too, but wanted a <code>draw tile</code> block that could be modified later.</li>-->
