        <h2>Programming Lab 2: Script Variables</h2>
        <p>Students have already created blocks that have input variables, and have used those within the block's script. This lab introduces the <img src="/bjc-r/img/prog/scriptvar.png" alt="script variables" /> block, which allows the programmer to create variables for scripts that are <em>not</em> inside blocks, and extra temporary variables for blocks that need them. They allow you to save, use, or modify  information that the script will need while it is running. Script variables exist <em>only while the script is running</em> and <em>only inside that script</em>. Blocks used <em>inside</em> a script can set, use, or change the value of that script's variables; blocks outside of that script can not.</p>
        <p><strong>Students get a choice</strong> of small projects in <strong>art</strong> or <strong>language</strong> or <strong>mathematics</strong> and get plenty of practice building blocks of various types including predicates. Students get continued opportunities to debug before lab 3, which begins to focus on the development of more complex programs.</p>
<h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Getting, renaming, setting, and using a script variable are all new. Some students will need help just building the script shown in problem 1 on the first page of this lab. An animation shows most of what they will need to do, but make sure you are comfortable enough, yourself, to help if that is needed.</li>
                <li>With other programming, analyzing, and debugging problems, it can actually be useful for you <em>not</em> to look fully fluent, even if you know exactly what to do. Showing how you might <em>puzzle out</em> the problem can be an excellent way of modeling the thinking for your students. You don't have to &quot;fake&quot; not knowing; just asking what various bits of the program do, or what they're supposed to do, or how the student figured out what to put in or where to put it, or pausing for a moment to ponder the result, or trying various inputs to see how the program responds can be enormously helpful to the student because it <em>illustrates</em> a good analysis/debugging technique. Often enough, students then find the solutions themselves.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>


        <h3>Students will:</h3>
        <div class="sidenoteBig">
        	<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
        	<ul>
            	<li>In Unit 6, students will learn how to use <strong>recursion</strong> to understand <code>factorial</code> and <code>power</code> (and some other functions for which they are currently creating using script variables) in a new way.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn to use  script variables and get more practice with predicates. </li>
                <li>Choose among projects in <strong>art</strong> (modeling the artwork of Mondrian or Albers), <strong>language</strong>  (simple  encryption) and <strong>mathematics</strong> (creating <code>factorial</code> and <code>power</code> and other functions). </li>
                <li>Debug.</li>
            </ul>
</div> 
              
        
        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Introducing the first page:</strong> The video in problem #1 shows how to create, name and set the value of a script variable. Decide whether, for your students at this time, it is better for them to work from that video, or watch <em>you</em> as you demonstrate.</li>
                <li>As in Lab 1, remaining class time can be mostly lab. </li>
                <li>Students work in pairs, switching regularly. You remain available for help, but encourage students to check with each other, as well, for ideas and help.  </li>
            </ul>
    </div>


        <h3>Look For:</h3>
        <div><ul><li>As you notice interesting student work&mdash;creative responses to assigned tasks, ideas that go beyond the tasks, or interesting bugs&mdash;you may choose to have students share, but allow plenty of time for students to do the programming.</li></ul></div>

            <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <div><ul>
        	<li>Be aware that the curriculum very deliberately starts from variables with  limited scope, giving students as much experience as possible with them (<code>for</code> block variables, custom block inputs, and now script variables) <em>before</em> introducing global variables. We want to get students in the habit of using local variables without having to make a big fuss about Thou Shalt Not Use Global Variables. So, you don't have to call attention to scope issues, but try not to undermine this effort with global variables.</li>
        	<li>Students who choose the "writing secret code" project will encounter <code>unicode</code> and explore it a bit. They can be leaders in discussions of that topic when it comes up later in the year.</li>
        	<li>It's possible to get a non-keyboard character into the <code>unicode of</code> block by copying it in another program (from a web page or a text file, for example) and then pasting it in Snap<em>!</em> with control-V or command-V.</li>
        	<li>This is a perfect place for the creativity called for in the CS Principles. Try to find time for students to share the different ideas they've brought to their projects. </li>
        	<li>At the end of the Script Variable Projects page is a teaser for the functional programming style coming in Unit 3. As usual when we tease later parts of the curriculum, don't make a fuss about this.</li>
        	<li>In the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/2-script-variables/3-predicates.html" target="new">Building a useful collection of predicates</a> page, many students find the first problem (<code>&gt;=</code>) difficult, but don't let them give up. It seems to lead to a big improvement in students' understanding both of logic and of composition of functions. Beware of students typing the words &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; into <code>report</code> blocks instead of using the Boolean constant blocks. That bug can take hours to find and isn't intellectually interesting; just tell them how to fix it so that they can get to the interesting logic bugs.&#x263A; </li>
        	<li>In the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-conditionals-abstraction-testing/2-script-variables/4-analyzing-debugging-simplifying.html" target="new">Analyzing, debugging, and simplifying code</a> page, take note of the last question, 4c. The point it's making is important: When computing a function, write a reporter, not a command block that <code>say</code>s the value. The latter can't participate in composition of functions. In the case of <code>max</code>, we're later going to compose it with itself to find the maximum of <em>three</em> numbers. People who've programmed in non-interactive languages aren't accustomed to being able to click on a reporter to see what it reports, and tend to write scripts with lots of <code>ask and wait</code> blocks at the beginning and lots of <code>say</code> blocks at the end. Instead, write a reporter with inputs.</li>
