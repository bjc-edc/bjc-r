        <h2>Programming Lab 3: Developing More Complex Programs</h2>
        <p>In Lab 3, students build two  complex games, focusing almost exclusively on ideas of <strong>abstraction</strong> to serve the goals  writing clear, debuggable, improvable code&mdash;all essential for developing complex programs. They are given goals and specifications for the programs&mdash;and are given guidance on <em>structuring</em> the programs&mdash;but must find their own ways to build the parts. Both the game board project and the number-guessing-game project are very extensible and modifiable and may lead students to their own ideas.</p>
    <p>There is little new <span class="snap">snap</span> code in Lab 3. Even the idea of abstraction—analyzing a task to find its chunks or component parts or special cases  and then build blocks that <em>specialize</em> in each of them—is not really new. Students did that when they built <code>plural</code>. But making a habit of analyzing and chunking tasks takes time and experience. </p>
        <p>The lab ends with three shorter activities&mdash;essentially how-to's&mdash;showing techniques that can be useful in more complex programming tasks.</p>
<h3>Pacing: </h3>
    <div>
      <ul>
                <li>The first three pages of this lab—Developing a Board Game, Developing a Number Guessing Game, and Brick Wall—are the most important. Plan with the hopes of doing the last three pages as well, but if students get involved in extensions of the first three pages, give that the priority and feel free to skip or condense the last three.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

<h3>Prepare:</h3>
    <div>
      <ul>
                <li>Search for some Computing in the News topics, or ask your students to look for them in advance.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h3>Students will:</h3>
        <div class="sidenoteBig">
        	<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
        	<ul>
            	<li>The tools developed in this unit anticipate a variety of games that students will be able to develop: tic-tac-toe, magic-square games, and others. More powerful programming techniques&mdash;particularly <strong>lists</strong> which are the major new programming idea in Unit 3&mdash;are useful in completing these games.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Build some tools for board games: a block to draw square arrays of various sizes for the game board, and a block that determines which cell within that array where the sprite is in.</li>
                <li>Build a number guessing game in which the user tries to guess the computer's secret number, and the computer tries to respond with as human-like dialogue as the programmer can build.</li>
                <li>Experience the idea of abstraction in the context of developing blocks that specialize.</li>
                <li>Learn how to specify the type of input that a block is expecting to receive.</li>
                <li>Get a bit of practice composing functions.</li>
            </ul>
</div> 
              
        
        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div><ul>
<li>Except for a Computing in the News, and the usual option of having students share particularly interesting problems or results, treat this lab as largely work-with-your-partner time.</li></ul></div>


        <h3>Look For:</h3>
        <div><ul>
          <li>As always, look for students who have interesting result to share.</li>
          <li>As always, look for students who seem stuck and are not getting the support that they need from their partner .</li>
        </ul>
</div>

        <h3>Tips:</h3>
        <div><ul>
          <li><strong>Page 1: Developing a board game</strong>. This  is the most complicated project in units 1 and 2, but students are given enough subtasks to make it likely that, <em>working together</em>, they can succeed. Working together is key. Some will figure out how to solve certain parts, and others will figure out how to solve other parts. Sharing, they will learn from each other.</li>
          <li><em>What do I do when a student asks how to solve a problem?</em> There will almost certainly be parts of some of these projects that <em>you</em> don't quickly see how to do. But even when you <em>do</em> know how to solve the problem, the most useful answer you can give is often one of these
          	<ol> 
              <li>Show me what you've already figured out.</li>
          	  <li>What are the <em>parts</em> of the problem that need to be built? </li>
          	  <li>Is there a good starting place (or a thing to do next), something really simple that will get us a bit closer?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Page 2: Developing a number guessing game</strong>. This involves simpler coding, but is very open to students' creative ideas.</li>
          <li><strong>Page 3: Brick wall</strong>. This involves the simplest coding of the three projects, but contains a key idea about abstraction. The suggestion to create a <code>draw mortar</code> block is important. It shows how editing <em>one</em> block can update a program in many places.</li>
          <li>As always, look for students who seem stuck and are not getting the support that they need from their partner .</li>
        </ul>
