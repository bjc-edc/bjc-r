		<h2>Lab 4: Making Computers Do Math</h2>
		<p>This lab doesn't have an overarching project; it's a collection of different techniques involving functions. The most important ideas, one per page, in order:       	</p>
        <ol>
		<li>the <code>mod</code> (remainder) function</li>
		<li>Snap<em>!</em>'s &quot;export blocks&quot; feature to make libraries</li>
		<li>the higher order function <code>combine</code></li></ol>
            
		<p>By the way, the use of language in which &quot;do math&quot; includes arithmetic functions but not Boolean functions comes from the AP CSP Framework. We do know that logic is part of math!</p>
		<h3>Pacing</h3>
		<div>
			The 3 required lab pages could be split across 2-4 days (<strong>70-140 minutes</strong>). Expected times to complete follow:
            <ul>                
                <li>25-50 minutes (&lt;1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-making-computers-do-math/1-mod-operator.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="The Mod Operator">The <code>Mod</code> Operator</a></li>

		<h3>Lab Pages</h3>

				<li>
					<strong>Page 1: The <code>Mod</code> Operator.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Understand the <code>mod</code> function.</li>
                                <li>Use <code>mod</code> to build a divisibility checker predicate and a predicate to test whether a number is even.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>
                                	<strong>Mathematics Note: <code>Mod</code>.</strong><a name="mod" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>For positive whole number inputs, the <code>mod</code> block returns the remainder when the first input is divided by the second.
                                    <div class="endnote">
                                        If either input is negative, what's meant by &quot;remainder&quot; gets more complicated, and there are actually two different functions, &quot;mod&quot; and &quot;remainder,&quot; with different answers.  Negative numbers will not be used with <code>mod</code> in this course.
                                    </div>
                                </li>
                                <li>Resist the urge to pre-teach <code>mod</code>, and instead allow student to explore and experience the function before formalizing. After most students have considered the self-check questions toward the end, post similar questions, such as "What is the value of 13 MOD 2 + 1?" (2) or "What is the value of 13 MOD (2 + 1)?" (1), and have students share and discuss their thinking with the class.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mathematics Note:</strong> The <em>integers</em> (referenced in the If There Is Time activity) are the counting numbers together with their negatives and zero: ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... The number 17 is an integer, and so is âˆ’17. But the number 17.3 is <em>not</em> an integer. Neither is &pi; (pi). An integer is a number for which <code>round</code> returns the number itself. Students will use this fact to develop their <code>integer?</code> predicate.</li>
                                <div class="todo">Any reason to keep any of this?
                                    <li>Question 4 has handholding baby steps hidden behind a link.  Students should understand that if they always use the hints throughout the curriculum, they'll end the year not having learned many programming skills.  On the other hand, people often get stuck on small points that they really do already understand, but just aren't seeing that day.  Maybe yesterday or tomorrow they'd find the same question easy.  So it's okay for them to click the hint links when they've really tried, and they and their partner are both really stuck on the problem.</li>
								    <li>A "number of" block is almost always done by first making a block to determine the actual items and then using <code>length</code> to count them.  This is what's behind the hint link.  But students should understand it as a general strategy.</li>

							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>Create a library of mathematical procedures.</li>
                                <li>Learn about importing and exporting functions.</li>
								<li>Practice using <code>keep</code>.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Use the <code>combine</code> block to develop several list functions.</li>
								<li>Add to students' collection of useful mathematical functions.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<div class="comment">Do we say this in the student pages?</div>
								<li><code>Map</code> and <code>keep</code> are versatile functions; almost anything might be used as its function input.  <code>Combine</code>, though, really makes sense only with <code>+</code>, <code>&times;</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>join</code>, <code>join words</code>, and the blocks <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> that students write in this lab.</li>
								<li>Regarding <code>average of list</code>, note that it's incorrect to average two numbers, then average that result with the third number, and so on.  That gives too much weight to the last numbers averaged in.  Students must first add all the numbers, then, just once, divide by the number of numbers.</li>
