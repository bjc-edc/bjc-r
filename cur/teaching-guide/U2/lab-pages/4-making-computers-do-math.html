		<h2>Lab 4: Making Computers Do Math</h2>
		<p>This lab has two purposes.  It's at this point in the course because it gives practice in making and using predicates.  But also, the specific predicates students build here will be used later in the course.</p>

		<h3>Pacing</h3>
		<div>
			The 2 required lab pages could be split across X-X days (<strong>X-X minutes</strong>). Expected times to complete follow:
            <ul>                
                <li>X-X minutes (X-X class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-making-computers-do-math/1-mod-operator.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="The Mod Operator">The <code>Mod</code> Operator</a></li>
				<li>X-X minutes (X-X class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-making-computers-do-math/2-math-predicates.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Mathematical Predicates">Mathematical Predicates</a></li>

		<h3>Lab Pages</h3>

							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Review exporting and importing blocks.</li>
								<li>Get comfortable using KEEP to answer "which items?" or "how many items?" questions.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Question 4 has handholding baby steps hidden behind a link.  Students should understand that if they always use the hints throughout the curriculum, they'll end the year not having learned many programming skills.  On the other hand, people often get stuck on small points that they really do already understand, but just aren't seeing that day.  Maybe yesterday or tomorrow they'd find the same question easy.  So it's okay for them to click the hint links when they've really tried, and they and their partner are both really stuck on the problem.</li>
								<li>A "number of" block is almost always done by first making a block to determine the actual items and then using <code>length</code> to count them.  This is what's behind the hint link.  But students should understand it as a general strategy.</li>
								<li><b>Pipe.</b>  There are, in general, three ways to denote calling a bunch of reporters, each taking the result of the previous one as an input.  We generally favor <em>nesting</em> function calls: f(g(x)).  The trouble with nesting, for students, is that the function they see first in the code is called last -- it's the <em>innermost</em> function -- <em>g</em> in the f(g(x)) example -- that's called first.</p>
								<p>The <code>pipe</code> is just another representation of the same function calls, but with the one that's called first shown first.  It'd be <code>pipe (x) (g) (f)</code> to compute f(g(x)).</p>
								<p>A third way to present the same idea is to use temporary variables to hold intermediate results:</p>
								<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/divisors-sets.png">
								<p>Students can do whatever makes them comfortable, but they should give nesting a try, and give pipe a try, before they settle on sequential <code>set</code>s of temporary variables.  But you can show them a page with the same function done all three ways, and they can use the sequential one to help them understand the other two.</p></li>

							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Learn to use the <code>combine</code> block.</li>
								<li>Add to students' collection of useful functions for later use.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<div class="comment">Do we say this in the student pages?</div>
								<li><code>Map</code> and <code>keep</code> are versatile functions; almost anything might be used as its function input.  <code>Combine</code>, though, really makes sense only with <code>+</code>, <code>&times;</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>join</code>, <code>join words</code>, and the blocks <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> that students write in this lab.</li>
								<li>About <code>average</code> (problem 5): Note that it's incorrect to average two numbers, then average that result with the third number, and so on.  That gives too much weight to the last numbers averaged in.  Students must first add all the numbers, then, just once, divide by the number of numbers.</li>
