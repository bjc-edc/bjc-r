        <h2>Lab 1: Improving Games by Using Variables</h2>
        <p>In this lab, students build a number-guessing game in which the player tries to guess the computer's secret number, and the computer responds with as human-like dialogue as the programmer can build. <!--In doing so, they focus on ideas of <strong>abstraction</strong> to serve the goals or writing clear, debuggable, improvable codeâ€”essential for developing complex programs.--> This project reviews conditionals and predicates before students refine their understanding of predicates and use them with <code>keep</code> in the following lab, and it also introduces the topic of <em>script variables</em> (a.k.a. local variables) for the storage of the computer's secret number.</p>
		<p>Students have already encountered variables in two contexts: they have created blocks with <em>input variables</em>, and they have used the <code>for</code> block, which provides a <em>index variable</em> (i.e., a counter). This lab introduces the <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/scriptvar.png" alt="script variables" /> block, which lets programmers create their own temporary variables, in which to store, use, or modify information that a script will need while it is running. Script variables <em>exist only while the script is running</em> and <em>only inside that script</em>. Inside that script, blocks can set, use, or change the value of that script's variables, but blocks outside that script cannot.</p>
        <p>Students take time to debug each portion of their project before adding each next page. They are given suggestions for features to add, one at a time, but are on their own to think about how to structure these extensions and modifications so that the code works and remains clear.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Page 1: Developing a Number Guessing Game with Script Variables.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Create and use a script variable to store temporary data.</li>
                                <li>Use the <code>repeat until</code> conditional to control program flow.</li>
                    			<li>Use the <code>ask</code> and <code>answer</code> blocks to manage text input.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>As a Class:</strong>
							<ul>
								<!--<li>This involves relatively simple coding, but is very open to students' creative ideas.</li>-->
                        		<li>There is an introductory offline activity suggested for this page included in the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/discussion.html#OA">Engaging Students in Building Algorithms Offline</a> section of the introduction to this Teacher Guide.</li>

					<strong>Page 2: Debugging and Extending Your Number Guessing Game.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Analyze and debug existing code.</li>

                                <li>Implement additional conditionals with predicates.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Debugging is a skill to refine over time. To support its development, analyze and debug projects together as a class. You may also have students share bugs they have encountered either to solicit suggestions from the class or to share a successful debugging approach. </li>

                            	<div class="todo">ST-I could not find these references in the manual.  In any event I am not in favor of recommendations that end with "too complicated" for this course.  Could be removed.<p>This was cut from the student pages. I agree that too-complicated stuff shouldn't be there, but I think it's ok to share with teachers. That being said, the manual has been updated, and these search terms no longer work, so I will cut this. --MF</p></div>
								<li>There are, in fact, two different ways in Snap<em>!</em> to avoid using a global variable for revisiting a value with the same script; look up "block variables" and "object oriented programming with lambda" in the <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/help/SnapManual.pdf" target="_blank">Snap<em>!</em> Reference Manual</a> if you or your students want to know more. (But both of those techniques are a little too complicated for this introductory course.)</li>
