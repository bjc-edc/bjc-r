        <h2>Lab 2: Making Art by Using Data Structures</h2>
        <p>Lists can contain anything: numbers, strings, other lists, even blocks. The objects <em>in</em> a list can be all of the same kind (all numbers, for example, or all lists that contain a name and a phone number) but they do not have to be. A list can, for example, contain an apartment number and a list of people at that address. The tabular data we are familiar with in spreadsheets can be represented as a list of same-length lists, the smaller lists representing each row in the table, and the enclosing list representing the entire spreadsheet.</p>

          <!--A table of data, is a list of rows of data, each row being a list of data.-->
<p> The "ordered pair" of algebra, the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) coordinates of a point, can be represented as a list of two numbers. In this lab, students will treat such a two-element list as a <em>point</em>, and they will encounter a list of points: a list of two-element lists. <!--(In this way, vectors and matrices can also be represented as lists of lists, but this unit will not extend into that mathematics.)--> The <code>list</code> block is the basic building block of many  complex structures.  </p>
<p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/A.png" alt="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" title="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" />
      <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/drawA.gif" alt="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" title="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" />  </p>

<p>In this lab, students will start first with a list of points already created for them, like the list shown above. They will create a <code>go to point</code> block that moves the sprite to <em>one</em> point given as input. To select information in the dataset, we only need to know where it appears. So students can use <code>item (3) of </code> the list of points to get the third point, <var> {10, 120}</var>, in that list and could use the code <div class="comment">Add the word <em>automate</em> to the student page, in the dialogue and in a gray vocab box.</div> 
<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/go-to-point-item-3-of-A.png" height="50" alt="go-to-point-item-3-of-A" title="go-to-point-item-3-of-A"> to move the sprite to that point. They will then <em>automate</em> this process, using the <code>for each</code> block to make the sprite visit each of these points. The point (10, 120) will be the third that it visits.  </p>
<p>A key idea in this lab is the use of abstraction to make code easier to read and understand. For example, they will replace  <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/coordinate-list-for-A.png" height="54" alt="coordinate-list-for-A"> with <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/point-list-for-A.png" height="82" alt="point-list-for-A">. The change seems trivial—everything works the same way and, in fact,  <code>point</code> does exactly and only what <code>list</code> does. The computer doesn't care which code is used, but the second version makes it easier for <em>humans</em> to see what the code is intended to mean. </p>
<p>They will also create <span class="endnote"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/x-coordinate.png" alt="x coordinate of {}" title="x coordinate of {}" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/y-coordinate.png" alt="y coordinate of {}" title="y coordinate of {}" /></span> to replace <code>item</code>, again in order to clarify the <em>purpose</em> of the code, and distinguish it from the details (selecting either the first or second item in a coordinate pair). This process is called constructing an <strong>abstract data type</strong>—using <code>point</code> as a &quot;constructor&quot; to produce the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) coordinate pair (a list) from two individual coordinates, and &quot;selectors&quot; <code>X coordinate of ()</code> and <code>Y coordinate of ()</code> to make code more readable. </p>
<p>Later in the lab, students will learn how to collect and store information—in this case, points as (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) pairs—in lists. First they will click on points on the stage directly to indicate which points they want the coordinates of; then they will let a script they like automate that process for collecting the vertices of a polygon in order to make a beautiful design.</p><div class="sidenote">Many of the <span class="snap">snap</span> projects linked from the student pages already have the tools imported.</div>Students need to <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/import-tools.png" alt="Import Tools" title="Import Tools" /> each time they open a new <span class="snap">snap</span> window. (Links to projects in the curriculum already contain the tools.)</p>

						<li>
							<strong>Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
				                <li>Use the <code>for each</code> block to access (and generally do something with) each item in a list.</li>
                            	<li>Learn how to specify the type of input that a block is expecting to receive.</li>

							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                        		<li>The dialogue has some complicated ideas. Arrange so that students get a chance to read it through more than once: individually, in small groups, in front of the class, etc. </li>
                                <!--<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/new-for-each-point-script.png" alt="script with for each (item) of (A) {go to point (item)}" title="script with for each (item) of (A) {go to point (item)}" />-->

                                <li>Encourage students to first complete the two blanks in the script (shown at right) and only after most of the letter is drawing	 correctly to begin addressing the two bugs at the beginning and end of the drawing process.</li>
                                <li>For the Take It Further problem, students may need to review the concept of <em>slope</em> from algebra to identify the remaining points in the letter.</li>
                                <!--<div class="todo">JK: ...in response to AC's comment that it's good to ask students to fix scripts because it demonstrates MP "something or other"<ul>
                                  <li>Has this comment been addressed? --MF</li></ul></div>-->
                                <li>Debugging: As students fix the bugs in Alphie and Betty's script, they must seek the cause(s) of the unwanted and missing lines in the drawing and identify the appropriate solution.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mathematics Note: Coordinates Again.</strong>  The list <strong>A</strong> contains the coordinates of the  points (<em>vertices</em>) that define the picture of the letter <em>A</em> in <em>that position</em> on the stage.  You can transform these coordinates to draw an exact replica of <em>A</em> in another spot on the stage. This would be useful, for example, if you want to set two letters next to each other on the screen, or make a "shadow" of <em>A</em> or to draw an offset image to create a three-dimensional effect. Try creating a list <em>AA</em> from <em>A</em> by adding, say, 50 to each of the coordinates of each of the points, and then plot the resulting points with <code>for each</code>.</li>
								<li>The information on this page about how to constrain a block's inputs to expect only numbers is useful but not essential. Consider <em>demonstrating</em> the method yourself, and having students watch you and follow along. They may find learning from you faster and better than  working through the page.</li>
								<li>Input types in Snap<em>!</em> are <em>program documentation,</em> not constraints on the programmer. You can drop any reporter into any input slot. The input slot shapes are just hints about what the block expects. Don't emphasize type checking. It's really important for a programmer to understand the domain and range of each function, but the domain (e.g., "an even positive integer" or "a word of no more than eight letters" or "a list whose items are either Booleans or lists") is often different from the language's types.</li>

                                	Discussion: After all students have worked through the dialogue (and perhaps also added the abstract data type to their U3L2-DrawShape project), you might review with questions like these:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>What are some benefits of creating an abstract data type?</li>
                                        <li>In what other situations might abstract data types be helpful?</li>
                                        <li>What is a <em>primitive</em> data type? What are some examples?</li>
                                        <li>What is an <em>abstract</em> data type? What are some examples?</li>
                                        <li>What is the difference between a primitive data type and an abstract data type?</li>
                                        <li>How are abstract data types an example of abstraction?</li>
                                    </ul>
                        		</li>
                                <li>"Abstract data type" (or ADT) sounds like a complicated thing, but programmers actually use them to simplify <em>and clarify</em> the logical structure of their code. It is a thing to help <em>people</em>, not <em>machines</em>. An abstract data type is like a "template" for data&mdash;for example, a registration form on which individuals write their name, address, email, etc., in a particular place helps us know where to look for each part of the data. </li>
<!--                                <li><strong>Mathematics Note:  Abstraction.</strong> <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/newglide.png" alt="glide to a point" title="glide to a point" /> You can make the script even easier to read and understand if you create a  block  <code>glide to pt</code>, made from <code>glide</code>, that  glides to a <em>point</em> rather than to a pair of coordinates.</li>  -->

					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This page prepares for page 4, in which a list of points is generated automatically within a program. This page introduces a program-generated list in an easier context: The user clicks on a point, and the program adds <em>that point</em> to the list.</li>
								<li>This page also introduces the primitive <code>stamp</code> to draw a picture of the sprite at its current location on the stage.</li>
								<li>The page also reinforces the idea of data abstraction. On page 2, students created an ADT and used it to rewrite a program they'd already written. It's hard to make that convincing, but here they are writing entirely new code that's much easier because of the <code>point</code> abstraction.</li>

							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                            <div class="todo">ST- Brian I am concerned about this next paragraph.  It sounds too convoluted and unnecessary to me to expose teachers to such a bug even though briefly.  What exactly is the point of using non-ASCII  characters in the first place?</div>
								<li><strong>The following is a problem only in spring 2017 during some teacher workshops; it will be fixed before students see this page. </strong>There is a Snap<em>!</em> bug that prevents saving to the cloud a project with a name made of non-ASCII characters, such as the script letters in the <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/stuff-here.png" alt="stuff here"> block. There are two workarounds: (1) replace the script words with plain letters; (2) use &quot;export project&quot; instead This will be an issue only until the page has been finished, at which point the <code>you write</code> block should no longer be used anywhere and can be deleted.</li>
								<li>Note that, when using <code>stamp</code>, you can't see any change until the sprite moves away, because the picture looks exactly like the sprite and is in exactly the same place. Kids will complain that it &quot;didn't work.&quot;</li>
								<li>Some students may object to making <code>list of points</code> a reporter, because the shape is already drawn when it finishes running -- why do we need to keep the list of point? Remind them that they might want to draw a letter <em>more than once,</em> as part of a message, for example.</li>
								<li>Experienced Scratch programmers, who have seen primitive reporters but have not been able to write their own before, may note that the primitive reporters don't <em>do</em> anything visible, but instead <em>only</em> report a value. <code>List of blocks</code>carries on an interaction and draws on the stage before finally reporting a value. They may find this surprising, but it's not a problem or breaking a rule.</li>

					<strong>Page 4: Mandala Design.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Apply everything learned in this lab in an artistic context.</li>
								<li>Use coding as a tool for creative and artistic expression.</li>
                                <li>Gain experience in breaking a large and difficult task into smaller managable parts.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This page relies on the succesful mastery of the last two pages, so it is essential that the students do not attempt this work until they have reached a level of comfort with the earlier concepts.</li>
								<li>It may be helpful for students to hand draw a simple version of the Mandala to get a feel how the algorithm might work.</li>
                                <li>Just as in the dialogues of previous pages, most students will benefit in verbalizing their algorithm in English first, before trying to puzzle pieces of the code together.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>EK 2.1.1A</strong> Digital data is represented by abstractions at different levels.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.2.1A</strong> The process of developing an abstraction involves removing detail and generalizing functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.2.1B</strong> An abstraction extracts common features from specific examples in order to generalize concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.2.1C</strong> An abstraction generalizes functionality with input parameters that allow software reuse.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.2.2A</strong> Software is developed using multiple levels of abstractions, such as constants, expressions, statements, procedures, and libraries.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.2.2B</strong> Being aware of and using multiple levels of abstraction in developing programs helps to more effectively apply available resources and tools to solve problems.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 2.2.3D</strong> In an abstraction hierarchy, higher levels of abstraction (the most general concepts) would be placed toward the top and lower level abstractions (the more specific concepts) toward the bottom.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.1.2G</strong> Program development includes identifying programmer and user concerns that affect the solution to problems.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.1.2J</strong> A programmer designs, implements, tests, debugs, and maintains programs when solving problems.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.1.3B</strong> Collaboration facilitates multiple perspectives in developing ideas for solving problems by programming.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.1.3F</strong> Effective communication between participants is required for successful collaboration when developing programs.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.2.1C</strong> Program instructions may involve variables that are initialized and updated, read, and written.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.3.1I</strong> Strings and string operations, including concatenation and some form of substring, are common in many programs.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.3.1K</strong> Lists and list operations, such as add, remove, and search, are common in many programs.</li> 
                <li><strong>EK 5.3.1L</strong> Using lists and procedures as abstractions in programming can result in programs that are easier to develop and maintain.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.5.1H</strong> Computational methods may use lists and collections to solve problems.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.5.1J</strong> Basic operations on collections include adding elements, removing elements, iterating over all elements, and determining whether an element is in a collection.</li>
