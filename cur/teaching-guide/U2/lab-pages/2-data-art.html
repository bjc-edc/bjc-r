        <h2>Lab 2: Making Art by Using Data Structures</h2>
        <p>Lists can contain anything: numbers, strings, other lists, even blocks. The objects <em>in</em> a list can be all of the same kind (all numbers, for example, or all lists that contain a name and a phone number) but they do not have to be. A list can, for example, contain an apartment number and a list of people at that address. The tabular data we are familiar with in spreadsheets can be represented as a list of same-length lists, the smaller lists representing each row in the table, and the enclosing list representing the entire spreadsheet.</p>

          <!--A table of data, is a list of rows of data, each row being a list of data.-->
<p> The "ordered pairs" of algebra, the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) coordinates of a point, can be represented as lists. So can vectors and matrices. The <code>list</code> block is the basic building block of these  complex structures. To select information in the dataset, we only need to know where it appears. </p>
        <p>Blocks can locate items in the nested lists. For example, <code>item (3) of </code> the list of points below gives <var> {10, 120}</var>. As the sprite visits each of these points (in a <code>for each</code> block) the point (10, 120) is the third that it visits.  </p>
		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/A.png" alt="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" title="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" />
        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/drawA.gif" alt="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" title="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" />

        <p>Students start by constructing a very simple contact list app. The list's elements are themselves lists. This requires not only collecting and storing information, but being able to retrieve it in useful ways. Students use <code>keep</code> to be able to collect only the information they need from a list, and learn to use <code>for each</code> to process lists of points on the plane&mdash;points which are themselves lists of coordinates. Data Types, a later page in this lab, returns to the idea of using abstraction to make the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) coordinate lists more recognizable and usable by creating the <strong>abstract data type</strong> <code>point</code> and constructing and identifying these coordinate lists that way. After some embellishment of the contact app, practicing and extending the ideas of abstraction, and a Lists Review and Self Check, students extend their use of <code>for each</code> and data types to a musical context.</p>
<p>Thus in Labs 1 and 2, students have encountered lists of strings/words, numbers, and lists. They also use <em>abstraction</em> to clarify and simplify code, and see how it makes code more flexible and maintainable. </p>

        <h3>Lab Pages</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<div class="todo">Paul, I think this page name is too long, but I put it here anyway. --MF</div>
					<strong>Page 1: Decomposing a Problem and Using <code>For Each</code> to Step Through a List.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
				                <li>Use the <code>for each</code> block to access each item of a list.</li>
                                <li>Use the <code>for each</code> block to access (and generally do something with) each item in a list.</li>
                            	<li>Debug programs that involve abstract data types by attending to the underlying abstraction.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                        		<li>The dialogue has some complicated ideas. Arrange so that students get a chance to read it through more than once: individually, in small groups, in front of the class, etc. </li>
                                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/A_foreach.png" alt="script with for each (item) of (A) {glide 1 secs to x:(blank) y:(blank)} then glide to (0, 0)" title="script with for each (item) of (A) {glide 1 secs to x:(blank) y:(blank)} then glide to (0, 0)" />
                                <li>Encourage students to first complete the two blanks in the script (shown at right) and only after most of the letter is drawing	 correctly to begin addressing the two bugs at the beginning and end of the drawing process.</li>
                                <li>For the Take It Further problem, students may want/be asked to review the concept of <em>slope</em> from algebra to identify the remaining points in the letter.</li>
                                <div class="todo">JK: ...in response to AC's comment that it's good to ask students to fix scripts because it demonstrates MP "something or other"<ul>
                                  <li>Has this comment been addressed? --MF</li></ul></div>
                                <li>Debugging: As students fix the bugs in Alphie and Betty's script, they must seek the cause(s) of the unwanted and missing lines in the drawing and identify the appropriate solution.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mathematics Note: Coordinates Again.</strong>  The list <strong>A</strong> contains the coordinates of the special points (<em>vertices</em>) that define the picture of the letter <em>A</em> in <em>that position</em> on the stage.  You can use these coordinates to draw an exact replica of <em>A</em> in another spot on the stage. This would be useful, for example, if you want to set two letters next to each other on the screen, or make a "shadow" of <em>A</em> or to draw an offset image to create a three-dimensional effect. Try creating a list <em>AA</em> from <em>A</em> by adding, say, 50 to each of the coordinates of each of the points, and then plot the resulting points with <code>for each</code>.  Later in this unit, you'll see how to produce <em>AA</em> with a lot less trouble, using  <code>map</code>.</li>

					<strong>Page 2: Data Types.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
				                <li>Create abstract data types to organize and manage data.</li>
								<li>Use lists of lists together with data types to organize and access data.</li>
                                <li>Understand what a data type is.</li>
		                    	<li>Understand how data types help manage program complexity and increase clarity, especially for testing, debugging and maintenance.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                            	<li>Again, consider having students read the dialogue more than once.</li>
		                        <li>
                                	Discussion: After all students have worked through the dialogue (and perhaps also added the abstract data type to their U3L2-DrawShape project), you might review with questions like these:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>What are some benefits of creating an abstract data type?</li>
                                        <li>In what other situations might abstract data types be helpful?</li>
                                        <li>What is a <em>primitive</em> data type? What are some examples?</li>
                                        <li>What is an <em>abstract</em> data type? What are some examples?</li>
                                        <li>What is the difference between a primitive data type and an abstract data type?</li>
                                        <li>How are abstract data types an example of abstraction?</li>
                                    </ul>
                        		</li>
                                <li>"Abstract data type" (or ADT) sounds like a complicated thing, but programmers actually use them to simplify <em>and clarify</em> the logical structure of their code. It is a thing to help <em>people</em>, not <em>machines</em>. An abstract data type is like a "template" for data&mdash;for example, a registration form on which individuals write their name, address, email, etc., in a particular place helps us know where to look for each part of the data. </li>
                                <li><strong>Mathematics Note:  Abstraction.</strong> <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/newglide.png" alt="glide to a point" title="glide to a point" /> You can make the script even easier to read and understand if you create a  block  <code>glide to pt</code>, made from <code>glide</code>, that  glides to a <em>point</em> rather than to a pair of coordinates.</li>

						</li>
					</ul>

					<strong>Page 3: Mandala Design.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Apply everything learned in this lab in an artistic context.</li>
								<li>Use coding as a tool for creative and artistic expression.</li>
                                <li>Gain experience in breaking a large and difficult task into smaller managable parts.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This page relies on the succesful mastery of the last two pages, so it is essential that the students do not attempt this work until they have reached a level of comfort with the earlier concepts.</li>
								<li>It may be helpful for students to hand draw a simple version of the Mandala to get a feel how the algorithm might work.</li>
                                <li>Just like in the dialogues of previous pages, most students will benefit in verbalizing their algorithm in English first, before trying to puzzle pieces of the code together.</li>
