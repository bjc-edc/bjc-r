        <h2>Lab 2: Making Lists</h2>
		<p>Students have touched on lists in Unit 1, but this lab is where we really dive into them. First, in the very simple shopping list app, students learn list creation and mutation. Then, in the quiz program, we introduce the very important idea of <em>data abstraction, </em>specifying a constructor and two selectors for the <code>quiz item</code> data type.</p>
        <div class="comment">This layout/design makes me naturally want to read the brown and skip the white (especially the white at the top). --MF, 11/18/19</div>
        <div class="takeNote">Data abstraction is a key idea in computer science.  Many languages provide a special syntax for abstract data types, so you might say something like<br />
<pre>class QuizItem {
   field question;
   field answer;
}</pre>
(That's not any particular language, just a stripped-down syntax to make the point.)  But in Snap<em>!</em> we use procedures instead: the constructor <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/quiz-item-constructor.png" alt="quiz item, question: ( ) answer: ( )"> to define the type, and selectors <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/question-selector.png" alt="question from quiz item ( )"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/answer-selector.png" alt="answer from quiz item ( )"> to retrieve the fields of the object.  By using ordinary procedures to implement the abstract type, we show that there's no magic involved.</div>
		<p>But what we <em>don't</em> do in this lab is to introduce the higher order functions that will be our main tools for list processing later in the course. We hint at them in the third page by using <code>for each item</code>, which is a higher order procedure but not a function, and therefore doesn't require the gray ring notation that will be introduced in the next lab.</p>

							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>An abstract data type consists of a <em>constructor</em> procedure and one or more <em>selector</em> procedures.</li>
                    			<li>Plan and build an abstract data type.</li>
                   			</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Tips:</strong>
						  <ul>
						    <li>This page has more reading, and less doing, than most. To make it look less intimidating, we have hidden much of the reading behind &quot;hint&quot; links. Exercise 2 asks students to read the text, clicking links one at a time to look at and then re-hide each code picture. This is the only place where we've used the &quot;hinting&quot; mechanism on things we want every student to read; it's an experiment.</li>
						    <li>After the text comes a long vocabulary box that defines six terms. It starts with the most concrete terms, the ones that name procedures you can point to. Then comes the notion of a data type, and the distinction between <em>primitive</em> types built into the language and <em>abstract</em> types that are specific to one application, rather than a general feature of the programming language. At the end, <em>data abstraction</em> itself is defined as the use of abstract data types.</li>

                    	<p>The table below compares the &quot;ordinary language&quot; use of <em>abstract</em> with the CS use. (It's not about data abstraction specifically, but the major levels of abstraction in computer science generally.) </p>
                        <p> In ordinary language, the actual physical computer is the "least abstract" thing, because you can hold it in your hand, push its buttons, maybe take it apart.  In ordinary language, programming seems to deal with "more abstract" ideas, things with no visible, tangible existence. In some ways, the physical thing might seem easiest to think about, and the programming at the top of the table harder.</p>
                    	<p>Computer scientists use "abstract" to mean something more like "this is defined in terms of that": application software is written in a high level language, which is itself implemented in a low level language.  It's <em>easier</em> to understand a language than to deal with all the details—how the language is built from lower level languages, and how they work with the computer architecture, and how that's built of transistors, which depend on the behavior of electrons, and so on. From that perspective, things get harder as you move down the table.  It's easy to write a program in Snap<em>!</em>, harder to write one in C, because you have to think about more details of memory management.  It's easier to understand the design of a computer architecture (the Intel Core design, for example) than to understand the physical circuits that implement it.</p>

            </ul>
            <h4>Essential Knowledge:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AAP-1.A.3:</strong> Some programming languages provide <em>types</em> to represent data, which are referenced using variables. These types include numbers, Booleans, lists, and strings.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-1.C.2:</strong> An <em>element</em> is an individual value in a list that is assigned a unique index.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-1.D.1:</strong> Data abstraction provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-1.D.2:</strong> Data abstractions manage complexity in programs by giving a collection of data a name without referencing the specific details of its representation.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-1.D.3:</strong> Data abstractions can be created using lists.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-1.D.4:</strong> Developing a data abstraction to implement in a program can result in a program that is easier to develop and maintain.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-1.D.6:</strong> The use of lists allows multiple related items to be treated as a single value. Lists are referred to by different names, such as <em>array</em>, depending on the programming language.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>AAP-1.D.7:</strong> The exam reference sheet provides the notation <pre class="inline">[value1, value2, value3…]</pre> to create a list with those values as the first, second, third, and so on items. For example,
                    <ul>
                        <li><pre class="inline">aList ← [value1, value2, value3,...]</pre> creates a new list that contains the values <pre class="inline">value1</pre>, <pre class="inline">value2</pre>, <pre class="inline">value3</pre>, and <pre class="inline">…</pre> at indices 1, 2, 3, and … respectively and assigns it to <pre class="inline">aList</pre>.</li>
                        <li><pre class="inline">aList ← []</pre> creates a new empty list and assigns it to <pre class="inline">aList</pre>.</li>
                        <li><pre class="inline">aList ← bList</pre> assigns a copy of the list <pre class="inline">bList</pre> to the list <pre class="inline">aList</pre>. For example, if <pre class="inline">bList</pre> contains <pre class="inline">[20, 40, 60]</pre>, then <pre class="inline">aList</pre> will also contain <pre class="inline">[20, 40, 60]</pre> after the assignment.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>AAP-2.N.1:</strong> The exam reference sheet provides basic operations on lists, including: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>assigning a value of an element of a list to a variable: <pre class="inline">x ← aList [i]</pre> assigns the value of <pre class="inline">aList[i]</pre> to the variable <pre class="inline">x</pre>.</li>
                        <li>
                            assigning a value to an element of a list: 
                            <ul>
                                <li><pre class="inline">aList[i] ← x</pre> assigns the value of <pre class="inline">x</pre> to <pre class="inline">aList[i]</pre>.</li><li><pre class="inline">aList[i] ← aList[j]</pre> assigns the value of <pre class="inline">aList[j]</pre> to <pre class="inline">aList[i]</pre>.</li>
                            </ul>
