        <h2>Lab 3: Making Decisions by Using Predicates</h2>
        <p>
            Students build various predicates (reporters that only report Boolean values&mdash;<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) and use them to solve word puzzles. First, they review their understanding of predicates, which they have used with conditinonals such as <code>if</code> and <code>repeat until</code>, and they learn to use predicates with the higher order function <code>keep</code> to report only the items from a list that match certain criteria. Then, the build several predicates to use in solving word puzzles (examples below) and use them with <code>keep</code> to perform various queries on a list of words. Finally, they create predicate expressions using Boolean operators (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>) to select list items that match multiple criteria.<br />

        </p>
        <p>
            Along the way, students learn about Booleans and Boolean operators, essential for the AP CSP test; learn how to indicate the intended <em>type</em> of an input variable (whether the intended input is to be a number, a string, a list, etc.); and they are introduced to the <code>mod</code> block which reports the remainder when two numbers are divided.<br />

                                    Some <strong>vocabulary</strong> (for <em>you</em> to use in context,  not to require of students):
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A <em>command</em> is a single Lego-brick-shaped block, without its inputs. It tells the computer to do something.</li>
                                        <li>A <em>reporter</em> is a single oval-shaped block, without its inputs. It reports data.</li>
                                        <li>A <em>predicate</em> is a single hexagonal block, without its inputs. It's a reporter that only reports Boolean values.</li>
                                        <li>A <em>Boolean value</em> is <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true"> or <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false">. (Not the text strings "true" and "false"; not 0 and 1.)</li>
                                        <li>An <em>instruction</em> is a command block along with its inputs or input expressions.</li>
                                        <li>An <em>expression</em> is a reporter block along with its inputs or input expressions.</li>
                                        <li>A <em>Boolean expression</em> is a predicate block along with its inputs or input expressions.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    So a reporter or a predicate is a function, and an expression is a function applied to input values (often called "arguments").
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                	<strong>Mathematics Note: <code>Mod</code>.</strong><a name="mod" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>The <code>mod</code> block returns the remainder when the first input is divided by the second.
                                    <div class="endnote">
                                        <p>
                                            For positive whole numbers, this is the same as the notion of remainder that students learn in elementary school when they learn to divide one whole number by another. So:<br />
                                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/7mod5reporting2.png" alt="7 mod 5 reporting 2" title="7 mod 5 reporting 2" /><br />
                                            because when 7 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2 (and the quotient is 1).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The behavior of the <code>mod</code> block may seem mysterious when one or both of the inputs are negative integers. For example:<br />
                                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/-7mod5reporting3.png" alt="-7 mod 5 reporting 3" title="-7 mod 5 reporting 3" />
                                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/-7mod-5reporting-2.png" alt="-7 mod -5 reporting -2" title="-7 mod -5 reporting -2" />
                                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/7mod-5reporting-3.png" alt="7 mod -5 reporting -3" title="7 mod -5 reporting -3" /><br />
                                            The sign of the output of <code>mod</code> agrees with the sign of its second input. But why?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Let's go back to positive whole numbers for a moment. The fact that <code>mod (7, 5) = 2</code> comes from <span class="katex">7 \div 5 = 1 \text{ remainder } 2</span>, which comes from <span class="katex">7 = 5 \times 1 + 2</span> where 1 is the <em>quotient</em> and 2 is the <em>remainder</em>. The quotient is the key to the mystery.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            In Snap<em>!</em>, you can get the quotient by dividing 7 by 5 to get 1.4 and then <em>rounding down</em>. This operation of rounding down is called <code>floor</code>, and it's built into Snap<em>!</em> (you can find it as a drop-down option in the <code>sqrt</code> block in the Operators pallete). For any real number, <code>floor</code> takes the closest integer to the left on the number line (hence the name "floor").<br />
                                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/floor7div5reporting1.png" alt="floor (7 ÷ 5) reporting 1" title="floor (7 ÷ 5) reporting 1" />
                                        </p>
                                        <p>So, given any two integers <span class="katex">a</span> and <span class="katex">b</span> (or real numbers, really) you can calculate the quotient <span class="katex">\frac{b}{a}</span> and then the floor of their quotient <span class="katex">\text{floor}(\frac{b}{a})</span>. Let's call this quotient <span class="katex">q</span>. Then, <span class="katex">b</span> will equal <span class="katex">aq</span> plus the little left over that we lost by using floor (the remainder, which we'll call <span class="katex">r</span>). So now, <span class="katex">b = aq + r</span> much like <span class="katex">7 = 5 \times 1 + 2</span>.</p>
                                        <p>That remainder is what Snap<em>!</em> and most programming languages report for <code>mod(b, a)</code> and this explains the signs of the outputs when one or both inputs are negative.</p>
                                        <p class="center">
                                            For example: 
                                            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/-7div5reporting-1.4.png" alt="-7 ÷ 5 reporting -1.4" title="-7 ÷ 5 reporting -1.4" />, so

                                            and <span class="katex">-7=5\times(-2)+3</span>, so 
                                            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/-7mod5reporting3.png" alt="-7 mod 5 reporting 3" title="-7 mod 5 reporting 3" />.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="center">
                                            Another example:

                                	If students attempt the "If There Is Time" problem, they will likely need some time to consider how to access the last letter of a word. Use probing questions to support their problem-solving:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>How can you find the place number of the last letter?</li>
                                        <li>Look back at the last problem about the 9<sup>th</sup> letter, how is that related?</li>

                                </li>
								<!--<li><strong>Mathematics Note: Predicates.</strong> In addition to predicting the output in problems 1 and 2, think about asking students to explain what the computer is doing when it calculates the output for each. Look for general principles like "<code>and</code> reports <code>true</code> if <em>both</em> of its inputs report <code>true</code>" and "<code>or</code> reports <code>true</code> if <em>at least one</em> of its inputs report <code>true</code>". Also look for precise statements about when <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> report <code>false</code>. Jumping to formalities like "truth tables" won't be as effective as if students develop the rules for themselves.</li>-->
