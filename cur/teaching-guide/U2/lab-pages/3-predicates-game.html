        <h2>Lab 3: Making Decisions by Using Predicates</h2>
        <p>
          Students build various predicates (examples below)  and use them with <code>keep</code> to perform various queries on a list of words to solve a crossword puzzle. <br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/does-orange-6-letters-true.png" alt="does (orange) have (6) letters? reporting true" title="does (orange) have (6) letters? reporting true" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/is-letter-4-of-carrot-o-reporting-false.png" alt="is letter (4) of (carrot) the letter (o)? reporting false" title="is letter (4) of (carrot) the letter (o)? reporting false" />
		</p>
        <p> Predicates are reporters that  report only Boolean values: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Students have  used predicates with conditionals such as <code>if</code> and <code>repeat until</code>.</p>
		<p>
            Students learn to build new predicates by combining basic predicates (like <code>=</code> or <code>&gt;</code>) with  operations like <code>length of</code> or <code>letter 1 of</code>, or the <code>mod</code> block (which reports the remainder when a number is divided by another).<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/17-mod-5-reporting-2.png" alt="(17) mod (5) reporting 2" title="(17) mod (5) reporting 2" /> <br />
            Then they learn to combine their predicates into more complex predicate expressions using Boolean operators (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>), so that they can  select list items that meet multiple criteria.
        </p>

                                    Some vocabulary for <em>you</em> to use in context,  not to require of students:
                                    <ul>
										<li>A <em>command</em> is a single puzzle-shaped block, without its inputs. For example: <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-empty.png" alt="say ()" title="say ()" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move-steps.png" alt="move () steps" title="move () steps" /> are commands. <!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/generic-command-block.png" alt="Lego-shaped-generic-command-block">--> They tell the computer to do something.</li>
                                        <li>A <em>reporter</em> is a single oval-shaped block, without its inputs. For example: <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/round-a-number.png" alt="round ()" title="round ()" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-x.png" alt="mouse x" title="mouse x" /> are reporters. <!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/generic-reporter-block.png"  alt="oval-shaped-generic-reporter-block">--> They report data.</li>
                                        <li>A <em>predicate</em> is a single hexagonal block, without its inputs. For example: <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/touching.png" alt="touching ()?" title="touching ()?" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/less-than.png" alt="() &lt; ()" title="() &lt; ()" /> are predicates. <!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/generic-predicate-block.png" alt="hexagonal-shaped-generic-predicate-block">--> They are reporters that  reports only Boolean values.</li>
                                        <li>A <em>Boolean value</em> is <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/true.png" alt="true"> or <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/false.png" alt="false">. (Not the text strings "true" and "false"; not 0 and 1.)</li>
                                        <li>An <em>instruction</em> is a command block along with its inputs or input expressions. For example: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/go-to-point(list(-50)(20)).png" alt="go to point (list (-50) (20))" title="go to point (list (-50) (20))" /> is an instruction. <!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/generic-instruction.png" alt="generic-command-block with input 100">--></li>
                                        <li>An <em>expression</em> is a reporter block along with its inputs or input expressions. For example: <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/ycoordinateofpoint.png" height="46" alt="y coordinate block" title="y coordinate block">  is an expression. <!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/generic-expression.png" alt="generic-reporter block with input &quot;house&quot;">--> </li>
                                        <li>A <em>Boolean expression</em> is a predicate block  with its inputs or input expressions. For example: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/a-gt-7.png" alt="a &gt; 7" title="a &gt; 7" /> is a Boolean expression. <!--<img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/generic-Boolean-expression.png" alt="generic-predicate-block with inputs">--></li>
                                    </ul>
									Reporters and predicates are also called functions. Expressions are functions applied to input values. (Input values are often called "arguments.")
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                	<strong>Mathematics Note: <code>Mod</code>.</strong><a name="mod" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>For positive whole number inputs, the <code>mod</code> block returns the remainder when the first input is divided by the second.
                                    <div class="endnote">
                                        If either input is negative, what's meant by &quot;remainder&quot; gets more complicated, and there are actually two different functions, &quot;mod&quot; and &quot;remainder,&quot; with different answers.  Negative numbers will not be used with <code>mod</code> in this course.
  <!--                                      <p>For positive whole numbers, this is the same as the notion of remainder that students learn in elementary school when they learn to divide one whole number by another. So:<br />
                                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/7mod5reporting2.png" alt="7 mod 5 reporting 2" title="7 mod 5 reporting 2" /><br />
                                            because when 7 is divided by 5, the remainder is 2 (and the quotient is 1).
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <p>
                                            The behavior of the <code>mod</code> block may seem mysterious when one or both of the inputs are negative integers. For example:<br />
                                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/-7mod5reporting3.png" alt="-7 mod 5 reporting 3" title="-7 mod 5 reporting 3" />
                                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/-7mod-5reporting-2.png" alt="-7 mod -5 reporting -2" title="-7 mod -5 reporting -2" />
                                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/7mod-5reporting-3.png" alt="7 mod -5 reporting -3" title="7 mod -5 reporting -3" /><br />
                                            The sign of the output of <code>mod</code> agrees with the sign of its second input. But why?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Let's go back to positive whole numbers for a moment. The fact that <code>mod (7, 5) = 2</code> comes from <span class="katex">7 \div 5 = 1 \text{ remainder } 2</span>, which comes from <span class="katex">7 = 5 \times 1 + 2</span> where 1 is the <em>quotient</em> and 2 is the <em>remainder</em>. The quotient is the key to the mystery.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            In Snap<em>!</em>, you can get the quotient by dividing 7 by 5 to get 1.4 and then <em>rounding down</em>. This operation of rounding down is called <code>floor</code>, and it's built into Snap<em>!</em> (you can find it as a drop-down option in the <code>sqrt</code> block in the Operators pallete). For any real number, <code>floor</code> takes the closest integer to the left on the number line (hence the name "floor").<br />
                                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/floor7div5reporting1.png" alt="floor (7 ÷ 5) reporting 1" title="floor (7 ÷ 5) reporting 1" />
                                        </p>
                                        <p>So, given any two integers <span class="katex">a</span> and <span class="katex">b</span> (or real numbers, really) you can calculate the quotient <span class="katex">\frac{b}{a}</span> and then the floor of their quotient <span class="katex">\text{floor}(\frac{b}{a})</span>. Let's call this quotient <span class="katex">q</span>. Then, <span class="katex">b</span> will equal <span class="katex">aq</span> plus the little left over that we lost by using floor (the remainder, which we'll call <span class="katex">r</span>). So now, <span class="katex">b = aq + r</span> much like <span class="katex">7 = 5 \times 1 + 2</span>.</p>
                                        <p>That remainder is what Snap<em>!</em> and most programming languages report for <code>mod(b, a)</code> and this explains the signs of the outputs when one or both inputs are negative.</p>
                                        <p class="center">
                                            For example: 
                                            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/-7div5reporting-1.4.png" alt="-7 ÷ 5 reporting -1.4" title="-7 ÷ 5 reporting -1.4" />, so 
                                            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/floor(-7div5)reporting2.png" alt="floor (-7 ÷ 5) reporting 2" title="floor (-7 ÷ 5) reporting 2" /><br />
                                            and <span class="katex">-7=5\times(-2)+3</span>, so 
                                            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/-7mod5reporting3.png" alt="-7 mod 5 reporting 3" title="-7 mod 5 reporting 3" />.
                                        </p>

                                            Another example:

						<li><strong>Learning Goal:</strong> Learn how the <code>keep</code> block uses predicates to select items from a list.</li>
						<li><strong>Tip:</strong> Ask students to articulate the <em>basic</em> idea of the <code>keep</code> block. It's a reporter that takes a predicate and a list as input, and reports only the items from the list that meet the criteria specified by the predicate. The predicate itself must have a blank for the list items to cycle through.</li>

								<li>Look back at the last problem about the 9<sup>th</sup> letter, how is that related?</li>
							</ul>
							<!--<li><strong>Mathematics Note: Predicates.</strong> In addition to predicting the output in problems 1 and 2, think about asking students to explain what the computer is doing when it calculates the output for each. Look for general principles like "<code>and</code> reports <code>true</code> if <em>both</em> of its inputs report <code>true</code>" and "<code>or</code> reports <code>true</code> if <em>at least one</em> of its inputs report <code>true</code>". Also look for precise statements about when <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> report <code>false</code>. Jumping to formalities like "truth tables" won't be as effective as if students develop the rules for themselves.</li>-->
