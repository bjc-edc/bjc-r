        <h2>Lab 3: Making Decisions</h2>
        <p>
            Students build various predicates (examples below)  and use them with <code>keep</code> to perform various queries on a list of words to solve a crossword puzzle. <br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/does-orange-6-letters-true.png" alt="does (orange) have (6) letters? reporting true" title="does (orange) have (6) letters? reporting true" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/is-letter-4-of-carrot-o-reporting-false.png" alt="is letter (4) of (carrot) the letter (o)? reporting false" title="is letter (4) of (carrot) the letter (o)? reporting false" />
		</p>
        <p> Predicates are reporters that  report only Boolean values: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Students have  used predicates with conditionals such as <code>if</code> and <code>repeat until</code>.</p>
		<p>
            Students learn to build new predicates by combining basic predicates (like <code>=</code> or <code>&gt;</code>) with  operations like <code>length of</code> or <code>letter 1 of</code>, or the <code>mod</code> block (which reports the remainder when a number is divided by another).<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/17-mod-5-reporting-2.png" alt="(17) mod (5) reporting 2" title="(17) mod (5) reporting 2" /> <br />
            Then they learn to combine their predicates into more complex predicate expressions using Boolean operators (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>), so that they can  select list items that meet multiple criteria.
        </p>

                                <li>In English, "or" can be either <em>inclusive</em> (meaning and/or) or <em>exclusive</em> (meaning one or the other, but not both) as the examples on the lab page describe. In computer science, <code>or</code> is inclusive (if either or both of the inputs are true, the result is true), and a separate function, <strong>xor</strong> (pronounced x-or, for "exclusive or"), is used when two true inputs must result in a false output. Exclusive or is not included in Snap<em>!</em> and is not taught in BJC. Only two (<code>and</code> and <code>or</code>) of the 16 possible Boolean operators are included. Interested students may wish to do additional research on the other Boolean operators (such as <strong>nand</strong> meaning <code>not (and)</code>; <strong>xnor</strong> meaning <code>not (</code><strong>xor</strong><code>)</code>, etc.). <!--However, a Take It Further activity on this page invites students to explore the others.--></li>
                                <li>Technically, an <em>operator</em> is a function of two inputs, like <code>+</code>. Snap<em>!</em> uses the term loosely, so not everything in the "Operators" palette is a two-input function. So, technically, <code>not</code> isn't a operator. </li>

						TG (for answer key): i) The <code>and</code> function can be represented as TFFF; ii-v) Answers will vary for parts ii and iii. The following table lists the 16 (part iv) possible two-input Boolean operators and their usefulness. The goal is for students to <em>think about usefulness</em>&mdash;not for them to accurately categorize each of the functions or even to learn the logic of each one. Unless you have a background in logic or computer science, even you (as teacher with the answer key) are likely to find some of these take a bit of thinking to wrap your mind around.

						vi) There are 256 three-input Boolean operators because there are eight combinations of inputs for a three-input Boolean operator and each of those combinations could report one of two values (T or F): <span class="katex">2^8=256</span>. (For comparison, there are 16 two-input Boolean operators because there are four combinations of inputs for a two-input operator and each can report one of two values (T or F): <span class="katex">2^4=16</span>.)

                                <li>Before solving the problems on this page, students must know that <code>x coordinate</code> goes left to right and is positive to the right of center and that the <code>y coordinate</code> goes up and down and is positive above the center.  It's not important to know the precise dimensions of the stage.</li>
                                <li>Consider doing the first two problems with the whole class and then asking what the picture would look like if the <code>and</code> block in the second problem were replaced with <code>or</code>.</li>
                                <li>Picture "i" shows a parabola.  Students who recall this curve from algebra may notice that one of the expressions has an <code>((x position) ^ 2)</code> in it.</li>
                                <li>It's not until rather late on the page that students are told to load the corresponding project. This is because the previous exercises are meant to be done <em>off the computer</em>.</li>
                                <li>Students don't need to replicate the precise coordinates of the change in colors when asked to invent Boolean expressions to generate specific pictures. If they get roughly the right shape, they have the idea.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Don't let students get hung up on the use of random positions in the script.  That's just a way to get the pattern to emerge visually when only a fraction of all the points have been colored.  We could instead have used the script<br />

            <h4>Essential Knowledge:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AAP-1.C.3:</strong> An <em>index</em> is a common method for referencing the elements in a list or string using natural numbers.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-1.C.4:</strong> A <em>string</em> is an ordered sequence of characters.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-2.A.4:</strong> Every algorithm can be constructed using combinations of sequencing, selection, and iteration.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-2.B.1:</strong> <em>Sequencing</em> is the application of each step of an algorithm in the order in which the code statements are given.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>AAP-2.E.2:</strong> The exam reference sheet provides the following relational operators: <pre class="inline">=, ≠, &gt;, &lt;, ≥, and ≤</pre>.
                    <ul>
                        <li><pre class="inline">a = b</pre></li>
                        <li><pre class="inline">a ≠ b</pre></li>
                        <li><pre class="inline">a &gt; b</pre></li>
                        <li><pre class="inline">a &lt; b</pre></li>
                        <li><pre class="inline">a ≥ b</pre></li>
                        <li><pre class="inline">a ≤ b</pre></li>
                    </ul>
                    These are used to test the relationship between two variables, expressions, or values. A comparison using a relational operator evaluates to a Boolean value. For example, <pre class="inline">a = b</pre> evaluates to <pre class="inline">true</pre> if <pre class="inline">a</pre> and <pre class="inline">b</pre> are equal; otherwise, it evaluates to <pre class="inline">false</pre>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>AAP-2.F.1:</strong> The exam reference sheet provides the logical operators <pre class="inline">NOT</pre>, <pre class="inline">AND</pre>, and <pre class="inline">OR</pre>, which evaluate to a Boolean value.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-2.F.2:</strong> The exam reference sheet provides <pre class="inline">NOT condition</pre>, which evaluates to <pre class="inline">true</pre> if <pre class="inline">condition</pre> is <pre class="inline">false</pre>; otherwise it evaluates to <pre class="inline">false</pre>.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-2.F.3:</strong> The exam reference sheet provides <pre class="inline">condition1 AND condition2</pre>, which evaluates to <pre class="inline">true</pre> if both <pre class="inline">condition1</pre> and <pre class="inline">condition2</pre> are <pre class="inline">true</pre>; otherwise it evaluates to <pre class="inline">false</pre>.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-2.F.4:</strong> The exam reference sheet provides <pre class="inline">condition1 OR condition2</pre>, which evaluates to <pre class="inline">true</pre> if <pre class="inline">condition1</pre> is <pre class="inline">true</pre> or if <pre class="inline">condition2</pre> is <pre class="inline">true</pre> or if both <pre class="inline">condition1</pre> and <pre class="inline">condition2</pre> are true; otherwise it evaluates to <pre class="inline">false</pre>.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-2.F.5:</strong> The operand for a logical operator is either a Boolean expression or a single Boolean value.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-2.G.1:</strong> <em>Selection</em> determines which parts of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being <pre class="inline">true</pre> or <pre class="inline">false</pre>.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-2.H.1:</strong> Conditional statements or “if-statements” affect the sequential flow of control by executing different statements based on the value of a Boolean expression.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-2.I.1:</strong> Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within conditional statements.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-2.L.1:</strong> Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-2.L.3:</strong> Some conditional statements can be written as equivalent Boolean expressions.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-2.L.4:</strong> Some Boolean expressions can be written as equivalent conditional statements.</li>
                <li><strong>AAP-2.L.5:</strong> Different algorithms can be developed or used to solve the same problem.</li>
            </ul>
