        <h2>Lab 3: Making Decisions</h2>
        <p>
          Students build various predicates (examples below)  and use them with <code>keep</code> to perform various queries on a list of words to solve a crossword puzzle. <br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/does-orange-6-letters-true.png" alt="does (orange) have (6) letters? reporting true" title="does (orange) have (6) letters? reporting true" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/is-letter-4-of-carrot-o-reporting-false.png" alt="is letter (4) of (carrot) the letter (o)? reporting false" title="is letter (4) of (carrot) the letter (o)? reporting false" />
		</p>
        <p> Predicates are reporters that  report only Boolean values: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Students have  used predicates with conditionals such as <code>if</code> and <code>repeat until</code>.</p>
		<p>
            Students learn to build new predicates by combining basic predicates (like <code>=</code> or <code>&gt;</code>) with  operations like <code>length of</code> or <code>letter 1 of</code>, or the <code>mod</code> block (which reports the remainder when a number is divided by another).<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/17-mod-5-reporting-2.png" alt="(17) mod (5) reporting 2" title="(17) mod (5) reporting 2" /> <br />
            Then they learn to combine their predicates into more complex predicate expressions using Boolean operators (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>), so that they can  select list items that meet multiple criteria.

                            <ul>
                                <li>Learn about, use, and interpret expressions with Boolean functions (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>).</li>
                                <li>Develop several versatile predicates: <code>≤</code>, <code>≥</code>, <code>≠</code>, and <code>between?</code>.</li>

                                <li>Compare different correct algorithms for the same task (<code>&ge;</code>).</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>In English, "or" can be either <em>inclusive</em> (meaning and/or) or <em>exclusive</em> (meaning one or the other, but not both) as the examples on the lab page describe. In computer science, <code>or</code> is inclusive (if either or both of the inputs are true, the result is true), and a separate function, <strong>xor</strong> (pronounced x-or, for "exclusive or"), is used when two true inputs must result in a false output. Exclusive or is not included in Snap<em>!</em> and is not taught in BJC. Only two (<code>and</code> and <code>or</code>) of the 16 possible Boolean operators are included. Interested students may wish to do additional research on the other Boolean operators (such as <strong>nand</strong> meaning <code>not (and)</code>; <strong>xnor</strong> meaning <code>not (</code><strong>xor</strong><code>)</code>, etc.). <!--However, a Take It Further activity on this page invites students to explore the others.--></li>
                                <li>Technically, an <em>operator</em> is a function of two inputs, like <code>+</code>. Snap<em>!</em> uses the term loosely, so not everything in the "Operators" palette is a two-input function. So, technically, <code>not</code> isn't a operator. </li>
                            </ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Page 3: Combining Conditionals.</strong><!--This only becomes an issue if a student does the Take It Further about how many Boolean operators there are; that's asking about two-input functions.--></li>

				    <ul>
				      <li>
				        What is the primary difference between the first two examples of ways to define <code>&ge;</code> (shown below)? The goal of this discussion is for students to see that a good optimization is that you never need to program <code>if <em>some predicate</em> report (true) else report (false)</code>, you can just do <code>report (<em>some predicate</em>)</code>.<br />

                      </li>
					  <li><strong>Tips:</strong>
						  <ul>
							  <li>Before solving the problems on this page, students must know that <code>x coordinate</code> goes left to right and is positive to the right of center and that the <code>y coordinate</code> goes up and down and is positive above the center.  It's not important to know the precise dimensions of the stage.</li>
							  <li>Consider doing the first two problems with the whole class and then asking what the picture would look like if the <code>and</code> block in the second problem were replaced with <code>or</code>.</li>
							  <li>Picture "i" shows a parabola.  Students who recall this curve from algebra may notice that one of the expressions has an <code>((x position) ^ 2)</code> in it.</li>
							  <li>It's not until rather late on the page that students are told to load the corresponding project. This is because the previous exercises are meant to be done <em>off the computer</em>.</li>
                              <li>Students don't need to replicate the precise coordinates of the change in colors when asked to invent Boolean expressions to generate specific pictures. If they get roughly the right shape, they have the idea.</li>
                              <li>
                                  Don't let students get hung up on the use of random positions in the script.  That's just a way to get the pattern to emerge visually when only a fraction of all the points have been colored.  We could instead have used the script<br />

                                <li>Ask students to articulate the <em>basic</em> idea of the <code>keep</code> block: It's a reporter that takes a predicate and a list as input, and it reports only the items from the list that meet the criteria specified by the predicate. The predicate itself must have a blank for the list items to cycle through.</li>
