        <div class="sidenoteBig">In preparation for Week 5:
            <ul>
            <li>The first time you teach this unit, do the first few two or three problems on each page of programming labs 1 and 2 yourself, to get a sense of the time it might take and to remind you of the contents.</li>
            <li>One focus of this entire unit is analyzing the task, breaking it into simpler chunks, and building those chunks independently. A second focus is debugging. One useful way to help when students get stuck is for you <em>not</em> to "know" the answer. You can be a bit "slow" in understanding their program and "naive" about solving the problem. Ask questions like "What is it <em>supposed</em> to do?" "What <em>is</em> it doing?" "What part of your result don't you like?" "What part of your program could possibly be doing <em>that</em>?" "Explain your script. What is each block doing?" "Can you make something that does <em>almost</em> what you want?" "Who got problem <em>x</em>? Can you explain how you did it?"</li>
            <li>Some of the projects will have subtleties, and/or will be slightly more complex than in unit 1. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div>During Week 5,  students will work on Labs 1-2 of Unit 2.
