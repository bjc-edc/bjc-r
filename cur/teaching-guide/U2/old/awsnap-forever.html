    <h2>Aww, Snap!</h2>
       <p>You want your sprite to keep moving to the right and off the stage, so you tell it to move forever.</p>
       
       <p>Unfortunately, your script (below) doesn't seem to work, and no matter how many times you click your script, the sprite stays in the middle of the stage. What's going on? How can you fix the script? Talk over your ideas with a classmate.</p>
