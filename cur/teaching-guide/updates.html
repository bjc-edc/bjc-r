        <p>Please note that some changes may continue to take place in "relatively fixed" units. We developers will eschew major changes on units with which teachers may be currently planning or teaching. We will develop those materials at other times of the year.</p>-->
        
        <p>The 2016-2017 version of the site will remain relatively static throughout the school year. There may be minor changes (such as correcting typos or editing images) but no major restructuring.</p>
