        <p>Please note that some changes may continue to take place in "relatively fixed" units. We developers will eschew major changes on units with which teachers may be currently planning or teaching. We will develop those materials at other times of the year.</p>-->
        
        <p>The 2016-2017 version of the site will remain relatively static throughout the school year. There may be minor changes (such as correcting typos, editing images, or teacher guide updates) but no major unit restructuring. For example in August, we marked a number of labs and pages as optional, but they have not been removed from the curriculum so as to maintain consistency for teachers familiar with these labs.</p>
        <p>For 2017-2018 there will be a new version that will be made available sometime in the summer of 2017.</p>
