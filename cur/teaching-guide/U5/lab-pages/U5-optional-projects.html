		<h2>Optional Project: Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
        <p>Note that this is one Optional Project split across four pages unlike previous units where each page of the Optional Projects section was independent.</p>

		<h3>Pacing</h3>
		<div>
			Expected times to complete the optional projects follow, but these times will vary significantly depending on your students:
			<ul>
				<li>10-15 minutes (&lt;1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/tic-tac-toe/1-review.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Review Your Tic-Tac-Toe Project">Review Your Tic-Tac-Toe Project</a></li>
				<li>20-30 minutes (&lt;1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/tic-tac-toe/2-creating-computer-player.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Creating a Computer Player">Creating a Computer Player</a></li>

		<h3>Prepare</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>You may choose to work through this project yourself before assigning it to students. The fourth page uses nested higher order functions. Abstraction helps separate the steps, but the overall effort requires careful attention to the steps along the way to the final result.</li>

                                <li>You may find it helpful to have students write out their description of these six blocks and how they work.</li>
								<li>Students must understand the idea of a <em>triple</em> in this program. It's not <em>any arbitrary</em> set of three squares; it's a set of three squares that count as a win: a row, a column, or a diagonal.</li>
								<li>The last problem is at the heart of the actual program; consider having a whole-class discussion about it. <code>Board</code> is the user interface's representation of who has moved where on the board, a straightforward list of nine squares, each of which can be X, O, or the initial value to indicate empty. <code>Status of all winning triples</code> represents the same board status, so in a sense it's redundant, but it presents that information in a form that's structured for the decision of the computer's move. One could say that <code>board</code> is for the conversation between the user and the program, while <code>status of all winning triples</code> is for the program thinking about its strategy.</li>

								<li>On this page and the next, students must alternate between two different points of view: (1) thinking about tic-tac-toe as a game, articulating the rules they use themselves when playing; (2) thinking about the problem of embodying those rules in a computer program. We try to make this explicit on the page, but be on the lookout for students who confuse these two levels of abstraction.</li>

                                	After changing the <var>board</var> initialization from nine instances of "Empty" to the numbers 1-9, students are likely to have two bugs:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>One in the code that determines if there is a tie</li>
                                        <li>Another in the <code>best empty square</code> block</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    In both cases, the bug is the use of "Empty" in the <code>contains</code> block and the solution is to use <code>is a number?</code> instead.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Creating the <code>winning triple</code> and <code>winning square</code> blocks are the most challenging parts of this page. Help students prepare by making sure they:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Debug everything that comes before developing these blocks</li>
                                        <li>Think through the approach they will take (as suggested on the page just before they begin building <code>winning triple</code>)</li>
                                        <li>Consider building the suggested <code>opponent to</code> and <code>how many?</code> blocks</li>
                                        <li>Review the hint about <code>winning triple</code> and the page where they first learned about <code>keep</code></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Encourage pairs who have done all of these things and are still stuck to talk with other pairs.
                                    <p>You may also choose to have them each write out their approach to 'determining if a player can win on their next turn' individually after they discuss it and before they start coding.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>The first Take It Further problem is about strategy; the second Take It Further problem is about programming.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                <li>If students have been told that a computer program is &quot;a sequence of steps,&quot; it may take some intellectual effort to learn to think instead of a program as built out of functions. But the effort pays off in vastly reducing the work of writing the actual code. For example, students are asked to write <code>winning square for</code>, a function whose input is &quot;X&quot; or &quot;O&quot; and whose return value is a number from 1 to 9, or 0 if there is no winning square on this move. Some students will want to jump right into coding, and will have an impossibly long sequence of <code>if board=</code>(some list)<code> report</code> (some number). (There are 3<sup>9</sup>=19,683 possible board configurations, so it would be a <em>very</em> long procedure if they try to cover every one.) But finding a winning triple is just <code>find first</code> from the list of winning triples, where the predicate function is, e.g., &quot;this triple has two O squares and no X squares.&quot; And then the actual winning square is <code>find first</code> looking for a number in the winning triple. The resulting program isn't quite a one-liner because it has to check for the case in which there is no winning triple, but it's hardly any code compared to the sequence of <code>if</code> statements.</li>
