		<h2>Optional Projects</h2>					

		<h3>Pacing</h3>
		<div>
			Expected times to complete the optional projects follow, but these times will vary significantly depending on your students:
			<ul>
				<li>40-60 minutes (1-2 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/optional-projects/astrid.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Astrid Design</a></li>
				<li>90-120 minutes (2-3 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/optional-projects/tic-tac-toe.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Tic-Tac-Toe With An Intelligent Computer Player</a></li>

							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Apply skills at developing algorithms and using abstractions in the context of a visual arts project.</li>
								<li>Gain dexterity in the field of computational art.</li>
                                <li>Synthesize artistic sensibilities and programming instincts.</li>

								<li>Some students, looking ahead at the Take It Further exercises, may try to use too much abstraction in their initial construction of the Astrid and get frustrated at their lack of progress.  The task given in the For You To Do exercises requires only joining points with <em>fixed</em> coordinates and should be relatively straightforward to do with the use of a <code>for</code> loop.  Encourage them not to look too far ahead into the Take It Further activities which involve significantly harder tasks.</li>
                                <li>Some students will find it difficult to generalize the algorithm they developed to generate the first quadrant Astrid and apply it to other quadrants.   It might be helpful to bring to their attention that first quadrant Astrid involves joining positive y-axis points to positive x-axis points, while the second quadrant Astrid involves joining positive y-axis points to negative x-axis points, etc.</li>

							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Practice using higher order functions in an extended project.</li>
								<li>Make the shift from the student's intuitive, informal tic-tac-toe strategy to an explicit, formal, algorithmic set of rules.</li>
</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Read the solutions linked below, and be sure you understand how higher order functions are used in each exercise, before class.</li>
								<li><strong>(2017â€“18 only)</strong> This project builds on the one in Unit 3, but students must start with the starter project provided for them, rather than from their own U3 solution, because (as the student page explains) this project requires a small change to the data structures they used in U3. (After this year, the U3 lab will be revised so that students can use their own solution as the starting point here.)</li>
								<li>Students must alternate between two different points of view: (1) thinking about tic-tac-toe as a game, articulating the rules they use themselves when playing; (2) thinking about the problem of embodying those rules in a computer program. We try to make this explicit on the page, so, for example, FYTD 1-2 are about the program; FYTD 3-5 are about the game strategy; 6-13 are about the program; TIF A is about strategy; TIF B is about programming. But be on the lookout for students who confuse these two levels of abstraction.</li>
								<li>FYTD 2 is at the heart of the actual program; consider having a whole-class discussion about it. <var>Board</var> is the user interface's representation of who has moved where on the board, a straightforward list of nine squares, each of which can be X, O, or the square number to indicate empty. <var>Status of winning triples</var> represents the same board status, so in a sense it's redundant, but it presents the board status in a form that's &quot;tuned up&quot; for the the choice of moves for the computer. You could say that <var>board</var> is for talking, while <var>status of winning triples</var> is for thinking.</li>
								<li>In particular, students must understand the idea of a <em>triple</em> in this program. It's not <em>any</em> set of three squares; it's a set of three squares that count as a win: a row, a column, or a diagonal. The procedure <code>TicTacToe wins</code>, which reports a list containing the eight possible winning triples, is the representation in the program of the rules of tic-tac-toe.</li>
								<li>In the first three units, students learned about three specific higher order functions: <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>. Those three are very common in functional programming, but here we provide a fourth, <code>find first</code>, that happens to be useful in several places in this program. Make sure that students notice this; later in the course, students will learn to design and write their own higher order functions.</li>
								<li>If students have been told that a computer program is &quot;a sequence of steps,&quot; it may take some intellectual effort to learn to think instead of a program as a composition of functions. But the effort pays off in vastly reducing the work of writing the actual code. For example, students are asked to write <code>winning square for</code>, a function whose input is &quot;X&quot; or &quot;O&quot; and whose return value is a number from 1 to 9, or 0 if there is no winning square on this move. Some students will want to jump right into coding, and will have a very long sequence of <code>if board=</code>(some list)<code> report</code> (some number). (There are 3<sup>9</sup>=19,683 possible board configurations, so it would be a <em>very</em> long procedure if they try to cover every one.) But finding a winning triple is just <code>find first</code> from the list of winning triples, where the predicate is, e.g., &quot;this triple has two O squares and no X squares.&quot; And then the actual winning square is <code>find first</code> looking for a number in the winning triple. The resulting program isn't quite a one-liner because it has to check for the case in which there is no winning triple, but it's hardly any code compared to the sequence of <code>if</code> statements.</li>
								<li>TIFs A and B are reasonable extensions to this program, but TIFs C and D suggest completely different approaches to writing a tic-tac-toe player. Even students who always do the TIFs might want to defer these until after the AP exam.</li>
