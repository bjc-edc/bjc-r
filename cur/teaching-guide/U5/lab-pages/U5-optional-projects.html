		<h2>Optional Project: Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
        <p>Note that this is one Optional Project split across four pages unlike previous units where each page of the Optional Projects section was independent.</p>

		<h3>Pacing</h3>

			Expected times to complete the optional projects follow, but these times will vary significantly depending on your students:

		<h3>Prepare</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>You may choose to work through this project yourself before assigning it to students. The fourth page uses nested higher order functions. Abstraction helps separate the steps, but the overall effort requires careful attention to the steps along the way to the final result.</li>

							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Apply skills at developing algorithms and using abstractions in the context of a visual arts project.</li>
								<li>Gain dexterity in the field of computational art.</li>
                                <li>Synthesize artistic sensibilities and programming instincts.</li>
								
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                           
								<li>Some students, looking ahead at the Take It Further exercises, may try to use too much abstraction in their initial construction of the Astrid and get frustrated at their lack of progress.  The task given in the For You To Do exercises requires only joining points with <em>fixed</em> coordinates and should be relatively straightforward to do with the use of a <code>for</code> loop.  Encourage them not to look too far ahead into the Take It Further activities which involve significantly harder tasks.</li>
                                <li>Some students will find it difficult to generalize the algorithm they developed to generate the first quadrant Astrid and apply it to other quadrants.   It might be helpful to bring to their attention that first quadrant Astrid involves joining positive y-axis points to positive x-axis points, while the second quadrant Astrid involves joining positive y-axis points to negative x-axis points, etc.</li>

                                <li>You may find it helpful to have students write out their description of these six blocks and how they work.</li>
								<li>Students must understand the idea of a <em>triple</em> in this program. It's not <em>any arbitrary</em> set of three squares; it's a set of three squares that count as a win: a row, a column, or a diagonal.</li>
								<li>The last problem is at the heart of the actual program; consider having a whole-class discussion about it. <code>Board</code> is the user interface's representation of who has moved where on the board, a straightforward list of nine squares, each of which can be X, O, or the initial value to indicate empty. <code>Status of winning triples</code> represents the same board status, so in a sense it's redundant, but it presents that information in a form that's structured for the decision of the computer's move. One could say that <code>board</code> is for the conversation between the user and the program, while <var>status of winning triples</var> is for the program thinking about its strategy.</li>

								<li>On this page and the next, students must alternate between two different points of view: (1) thinking about tic-tac-toe as a game, articulating the rules they use themselves when playing; (2) thinking about the problem of embodying those rules in a computer program. We try to make this explicit on the page, but be on the lookout for students who confuse these two levels of abstraction.</li>

                                	After changing the <var>board</var> initialization from nine instances of "Empty" to the numbers 1-9, students are likely to have two bugs:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>One in the code that determines if there is a tie</li>
                                        <li>Another in the <code>best empty square</code> block</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    In both cases, the bug is the use of "Empty" in the <code>contains</code> block and the solution is to use <code>is a number?</code> instead.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Creating the <code>winning triple</code> and <code>winning square</code> blocks are the most challenging parts of this page. Help students prepare by making sure they:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Debug everything that comes before developing these blocks</li>
                                        <li>Think through the approach they will take (as suggested on the page just before they begin building <code>winning triple</code>)</li>
                                        <li>Consider building the suggested <code>opponent to</code> and <code>how many?</code> blocks</li>
                                        <li>Review the hint about <code>winning triple</code> and the page where they first learned about <code>keep</code></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Encourage pairs who have done all of these things and are still stuck to talk with other pairs.
                                    <p>You may also choose to have them each write out their approach to 'determining if a player can win on their next turn' individually after they discuss it and before they start coding.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>The first Take It Further problem is about strategy; the second Take It Further problem is about programming.</li>
                            </ul>
