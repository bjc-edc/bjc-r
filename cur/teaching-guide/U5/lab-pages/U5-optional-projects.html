                                <li>You may find it helpful to have students write out their description of these six blocks and how they work.</li>
								<li>Students must understand the idea of a <em>triple</em> in this program. It's not <em>any arbitrary</em> set of three squares; it's a set of three squares that count as a win: a row, a column, or a diagonal.</li>
								<li>The last problem is at the heart of the actual program; consider having a whole-class discussion about it. <code>Board</code> is the user interface's representation of who has moved where on the board, a straightforward list of nine squares, each of which can be X, O, or the initial value to indicate empty. <code>Status of all winning triples</code> represents the same board status, so in a sense it's redundant, but it presents that information in a form that's structured for the decision of the computer's move. One could say that <code>board</code> is for the conversation between the user and the program, while <code>status of all winning triples</code> is for the program thinking about its strategy.</li>

								<li>On this page and the next, students must alternate between two different points of view: (1) thinking about tic-tac-toe as a game, articulating the rules they use themselves when playing; (2) thinking about the problem of embodying those rules in a computer program. We try to make this explicit on the page, but be on the lookout for students who confuse these two levels of abstraction.</li>

                                	After changing the <var>board</var> initialization from nine instances of "Empty" to the numbers 1-9, students are likely to have two bugs:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>One in the code that determines if there is a tie</li>
                                        <li>Another in the <code>best empty square</code> block</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    In both cases, the bug is the use of "Empty" in the <code>contains</code> block and the solution is to use <code>is a number?</code> instead.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Creating the <code>winning triple</code> and <code>winning square</code> blocks are the most challenging parts of this page. Help students prepare by making sure they:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Debug everything that comes before developing these blocks</li>
                                        <li>Think through the approach they will take (as suggested on the page just before they begin building <code>winning triple</code>)</li>
                                        <li>Consider building the suggested <code>opponent to</code> and <code>how many?</code> blocks</li>
                                        <li>Review the hint about <code>winning triple</code> and the page where they first learned about <code>keep</code></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Encourage pairs who have done all of these things and are still stuck to talk with other pairs.
                                    <p>You may also choose to have them each write out their approach to 'determining if a player can win on their next turn' individually after they discuss it and before they start coding.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>The first Take It Further problem is about strategy; the second Take It Further problem is about programming.</li>

                <li>If students have been told that a computer program is &quot;a sequence of steps,&quot; it may take some intellectual effort to learn to think instead of a program as built out of functions. But the effort pays off in vastly reducing the work of writing the actual code. For example, students are asked to write <code>winning square for</code>, a function whose input is &quot;X&quot; or &quot;O&quot; and whose return value is a number from 1 to 9, or 0 if there is no winning square on this move. Some students will want to jump right into coding, and will have an impossibly long sequence of <code>if board=</code>(some list)<code> report</code> (some number). (There are 3<sup>9</sup>=19,683 possible board configurations, so it would be a <em>very</em> long procedure if they try to cover every one.) But finding a winning triple is just <code>find first</code> from the list of winning triples, where the predicate function is, e.g., &quot;this triple has two O squares and no X squares.&quot; And then the actual winning square is <code>find first</code> looking for a number in the winning triple. The resulting program isn't quite a one-liner because it has to check for the case in which there is no winning triple, but it's hardly any code compared to the sequence of <code>if</code> statements.</li>
