				<li>You may choose to work through this project yourself before assigning it to students. The fourth page uses nested higher order functions. Abstraction helps separate the steps, but the overall effort requires careful attention to the steps along the way to the final result.</li>

							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Apply skills at developing algorithms and using abstractions in the context of a visual arts project.</li>
								<li>Gain dexterity in the field of computational art.</li>
                                <li>Synthesize artistic sensibilities and programming instincts.</li>

							<ul>
                           
								<li>Some students, looking ahead at the Take It Further exercises, may try to use too much abstraction in their initial construction of the Astrid and get frustrated at their lack of progress.  The task given in the For You To Do exercises requires only joining points with <em>fixed</em> coordinates and should be relatively straightforward to do with the use of a <code>for</code> loop.  Encourage them not to look too far ahead into the Take It Further activities which involve significantly harder tasks.</li>
                                <li>Some students will find it difficult to generalize the algorithm they developed to generate the first quadrant Astrid and apply it to other quadrants.   It might be helpful to bring to their attention that first quadrant Astrid involves joining positive y-axis points to positive x-axis points, while the second quadrant Astrid involves joining positive y-axis points to negative x-axis points, etc.</li>

                                	After changing the <var>board</var> initialization from nine instances of "Empty" to the numbers 1-9, students are likely to have two bugs:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>One in the code that determines if there is a tie</li>
                                        <li>Another in the <code>best empty square</code> block</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    In both cases, the bug is the use of "Empty" in the <code>contains</code> block and the solution is to use <code>is a number?</code> instead.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Creating the <code>winning triple</code> and <code>winning square</code> blocks are the most challenging parts of this page. Help students prepare by making sure they:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Debug everything that comes before developing these blocks</li>
                                        <li>Think through the approach they will take (as suggested on the page just before they begin building <code>winning triple</code>)</li>
                                        <li>Consider building the suggested <code>opponent to</code> and <code>how many?</code> blocks</li>
                                        <li>Review the hint about <code>winning triple</code> and the page where they first learned about <code>keep</code></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Encourage pairs who have done all of these things and are still stuck to talk with other pairs.
                                    <p>You may also choose to have them each write out their approach to 'determining if a player can win on their next turn' individually after they discuss it and before they start coding.</p>

							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Read the solutions linked below, and be sure you understand how higher order functions are used in each exercise, before class.</li>
								<li><s><strong>(2017–18 only)</strong> This project builds on the one in Unit 3, but students must start with the starter project provided for them, rather than from their own U3 solution, because (as the student page explains) this project requires a small change to the data structures they used in U3. (After this year, the U3 lab will be revised so that students can use their own solution as the starting point here.)</s></li>
								<li>Students must alternate between two different points of view: (1) thinking about tic-tac-toe as a game, articulating the rules they use themselves when playing; (2) thinking about the problem of embodying those rules in a computer program. We try to make this explicit on the page, so, for example, FYTD 1-2 are about the program; FYTD 3-5 are about the game strategy; 6-13 are about the program; TIF A is about strategy; TIF B is about programming. But be on the lookout for students who confuse these two levels of abstraction.</li>
								<li>FYTD 2 is at the heart of the actual program; consider having a whole-class discussion about it. <var>Board</var> is the user interface's representation of who has moved where on the board, a straightforward list of nine squares, each of which can be X, O, or the square number to indicate empty. <var>Status of winning triples</var> represents the same board status, so in a sense it's redundant, but it presents the board status in a form that's &quot;tuned up&quot; for the the choice of moves for the computer. You could say that <var>board</var> is for the conversation between the user and the program, while <var>status of winning triples</var> is for the program thinking about its strategy.</li>
								<li>In particular, students must understand the idea of a <em>triple</em> in this program. It's not <em>any arbitrary</em> set of three squares; it's a set of three squares that count as a win: a row, a column, or a diagonal. The procedure <code>TicTacToe wins</code>, which reports a list containing the eight possible winning triples, is the representation in the program of the rules of tic-tac-toe.</li>
								<li><s>In the first three units, students learned about three specific higher order functions: <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and <code>combine</code>. Those three are very common in functional programming, but here we provide a fourth, <code>find first item</code>, that happens to be useful in several places in this program. Make sure that students notice this; later in the course, students will learn to design and write their own higher order functions.
								  <ul>
								    <li>By the way, when representing this block as text we use <code>find first item</code> rather than just <code>find</code> so that students are absolutely sure what block we're talking about, but there's no &quot;official&quot; text form of the block name. For example, we use <code>keep</code>, not <code>keep items such that</code>, for that block. Once students get familiar with this block, you and they can just call it <code>find</code> (or <code>find first</code> as we do below just to make this point.)</li>
							      </ul></s>
								</li>
								<li>If students have been told that a computer program is &quot;a sequence of steps,&quot; it may take some intellectual effort to learn to think instead of a program as built out of functions. But the effort pays off in vastly reducing the work of writing the actual code. For example, students are asked to write <code>winning square for</code>, a function whose input is &quot;X&quot; or &quot;O&quot; and whose return value is a number from 1 to 9, or 0 if there is no winning square on this move. Some students will want to jump right into coding, and will have an impossibly long sequence of <code>if board=</code>(some list)<code> report</code> (some number). (There are 3<sup>9</sup>=19,683 possible board configurations, so it would be a <em>very</em> long procedure if they try to cover every one.) But finding a winning triple is just <code>find first</code> from the list of winning triples, where the predicate function is, e.g., &quot;this triple has two O squares and no X squares.&quot; And then the actual winning square is <code>find first</code> looking for a number in the winning triple. The resulting program isn't quite a one-liner because it has to check for the case in which there is no winning triple, but it's hardly any code compared to the sequence of <code>if</code> statements.</li>
								<li>TIFs A and B are reasonable extensions to this program, but TIFs C and D suggest completely different approaches to writing a tic-tac-toe player. Even students who always do the TIFs might want to defer these until after the AP exam.</li>
