        <h2>Lab 3: Models and Simulations</h2>
        <p>After a general introduction to the topic, students first build a simulation to model the flipping of a coin.  This introductory simulation is intended to give them experience in a simple and familiar context.  Then, if selected as a "Teacher's Choice" project, the students will model and simulate the spread of a disease in a population.  This is a very complex phenomena to study in real life so the  virtual model and its simulation will require significant simplification.  The agents in the population will be colored dots, for example, blue for healthy and red for sick.  The agents will move at a constant speed and the collisions between a sick and a healthy agent will lead to the healthy agent becoming also sick. The simulation will run until the entire population is infected.  The running time of the simulation will depend on various parameters input by the user such as the population size, the percentage of the population initially sick and the speed at which the agents are moving. Students will adjust these various parameters and formulate, refine, and test hypotheses about the resulting patterns in the spread of the disease. </p>
