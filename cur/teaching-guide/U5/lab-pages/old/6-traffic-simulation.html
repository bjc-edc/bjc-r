        <h2>Programming Lab 6: Traffic Simulation</h2>
		<p>Students build a simulation to model and explore highway traffic. Students adjust various constraints (acceleration and deceleration rates, intended speed, number of cars on the road) and formulate, refine, and test hypotheses about the resulting traffic patterns. </p>

            <p>The program is not the most <em>complex</em> that students have written, but this task may be the most challenging, partly because students have many decisions to make, and  less has been done for them at the start. Pair work is important—the challenge and decisions need at least two brains—and pairs may well want to confer with each other. </p>
            <p><strong>Tip: </strong> If students have difficulties figuring out how to create or debug a script, a very effective technique is  simply to ask &quot;What do you <em>want</em> it to do?&quot; or &quot;How does that script/block work?&quot; and have them explain. Often, in the process of articulating what they <em>want</em> or how  their block is <em>supposed</em> to work, they figure out what they need to do.</p>
            <p>At this stage in the course, you are not too likely to get overly simplistic answers like &quot;It's supposed to drive the car&quot; but, if you do, ask questions about the details: How will it know its current speed? How will it decide whether to go faster or slower? Have you <em>stored</em> the change in its speed so that it knows, next time it's moved, what speed to go? </p>
            <p><strong>Tip: </strong>If students ask explicitly <em>how</em> to do a particular thing, try to distinguish questions about Snap<em>!</em> from questions about programming. &quot;How do you tell the distance between one sprite and another&quot; is a Snap<em>!</em> question, because Snap<em>! </em>provides a block for that. &quot;How do you slow down the car&quot; is a question about programming because there are many ways to do that and many decisions to make. One effective way to respond is with another question: &quot;How are you keeping track of the car's speed?&quot; &quot;What speed would you like to change that to?&quot; Questions like these focus students' attention on the actions the program will have to take without telling how to implement those actions.</p>
            <p>Your job, then, will consist largely of being available for questions, and milling about looking at work and asking questions of your own.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Have a discussion or get straight to work? Depending on your class, you <em>may</em> want to start with a brainstorming session with the entire class using questions like the ones above. If so, keep it brief enough to leave more problems  left to solve during the programming. Try to get students to contribute with little to no talk from you—perhaps just pointing and nodding as if to say &quot;you next&quot;—so that they are doing essentially what they would be doing if you had not led a discussion. Don't even confirm or disconfirm—that is for them to figure out. Also try to ask for at least two alternative ways of solving each problem so that there isn't just a single solution that all students use. </li>
                        <li>Even with a discussion, there will be  details students need to work out as they program. </li>

                            Discussion: This session does benefit greatly from some starting discussion. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>What behaviors did you see?</li>
                                <li>Did everyone's simulation have the same behavior?</li>
                                <li>What might explain the particular phenomena you see?</li>
                                <li>Were there behaviors you didn't expect?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li> Not all the simulations will work the same way. Not all will even conform to the constraints. Some may, for example, fail to obey the speed limit, or may allow cars to pass each other.  Some may have so few cars that not much happens.  But some, especially if there are enough cars (12 is generally enough, depending on other variables), will show cars clumping together and gradually spreading out and then clumping together again. 
                        </li>
                        <li> After some discussion, have students work on the new lab page.  This is a very open-ended lab with no <em>specific</em> task except exploration of the model.  But it can be a great place for students to make and test hypotheses by playing with variables or even altering the model slightly. In slowing a car down, students might, for example, simply <em>copy</em> the speed of the car ahead or they might have the car slow down more gradually. Does it matter?
