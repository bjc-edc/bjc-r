        <h2>Programming Lab 5: Data Processing</h2>
		<p>Students learn the value of data visualization in acquiring new information from data, and the iterative way in which new insight is learned from data processing. Students learn the concept behind large data sets, including necessary tools for working with and understanding large data, and the value of working with others in discovering insights from large data. </p>

		<h3>Tips:</h3>

            <ul>
                <!--<li>
                    <strong>Page 1: Data Visualization.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This page leans heavily on the work in Unit 4, Lab 2 and Unit 5, Lab 2. If you're concerned about students' prior work, you might give them a starter file to work with. This may also be a time to remind students how to export a block from one project into another; in this case, take the block that loads the GPS data and import it into students' grapher apps. </li>
						<li>You may need to remind students about the <code>average</code> block and the processing work they did in the GPS lab. With the new grapher, they can plot the average of clusters in a different color on the correct scale.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>-->
                <li>
                    <strong>Page 1: Working With Large Data Sets.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Expect a wide variety of search results from the Baby Name Voyager, and look for opportunities for students to share interesting data with others. Of particular interest may be "fad" names that were popular in specific decades (Lisa, Jennifer), and other names that were popular long ago but are re-emerging (Emma).</li>
						<li>The Baby Name Voyager site frequently becomes unresponsive if no result is found. When this happens, ask students to reload the page.</li>
						<li>Some students may get frustrated by not finding their own name in the Baby Name Voyager. Point out to students that only a small percentage of all names are listed. A larger text file (available  <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-sorting/yob2014.txt">here</a>) contains all names for at least 5 births. You might check this file to see if your students' names are in it -- or even challenge a student to create an app that tests names against this data.</li>
						<li>You may want to draw some connections to prior units' social implications labs, since there have been discussions about large data sets, notably a discussion about privacy concerns in personally-identifiable information.</li>
						<li>During this lab, keep a lookout for news reports that involve the analysis of large data sets, for appropriate Computing In The News material.</li>
