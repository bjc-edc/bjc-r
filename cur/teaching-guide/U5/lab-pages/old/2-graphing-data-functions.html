        <h2>Lab 2: Data and Functions</h2>
        <div class="todo">This grapher <em>should</em>, when we revise, become the grapher used in the U4 analysis of Burger whatever.</div>
        <div class="todo">
        	from the old Lab 5:
			<p>Students learn the value of data visualization in acquiring new information from data, and the iterative way in which new insight is learned from data processing. Students learn the concept behind large data sets, including necessary tools for working with and understanding large data, and the value of working with others in discovering insights from large data. </p>  
        </div>
		<p>It is easier to compare the efficiency of the two algorithms if we can visualize the data we get from timing experiments. In this lab, students create a general graphing program that plots data points on a screen whose dimensions (scale) they have determined themselves. They then work with a dataset on a classroom of 27 sixth-graders and isolate various data subsets to create graphs of height vs. weight, age vs. height, age vs. weight, etc.</p>
        <p>This graphing program also has the option of taking a function as input and producing its Cartesian graph. On the last page, students explore using the app to plot a function such as <span class="katex">-5 + (x-3)^2</span>.</p> 
        <p>
            The graphing app that students build differs from many traditional graphing programs in that it requires hovering the mouse over the stage to input the <span class="katex">x</span>-values into the function, produce the points of the graph, and plot them. This is done for two reasons, one pedagogical and one practical:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>pedagogical</strong>: inputting the <code>mouse x</code> value into the function to get the corresponding <span class="katex">y</span> values supports understanding both what this graphing app is doing and the underlying mathematics of functions (e.g. unlike the <code>Graph datapoints</code> procedure, which begins with a complete set of <span class="katex">x</span> and <span class="katex">y</span> coordinates, the <code>Graph function</code> procedure needs to <em>generate</em> <span class="katex">y</span> values based on <em>inputed</em> <span class="katex">x</span> values&mdash;this is known to be a challenge in understanding functions for beginning algebra students)</li>
                <li><strong>practical</strong>: this approach makes use of what students already know about programming (e.g. how to read the mouse location and how to adjust it based on the graph scale) rather than working through the complicated algorithm of making subdivisions necessary to get a consistent curve</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Page 1: Working With Large Data Sets.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Expect a wide variety of search results from the Baby Name Voyager, and look for opportunities for students to share interesting data with others. Of particular interest may be "fad" names that were popular in specific decades (Lisa, Jennifer), and other names that were popular long ago but are re-emerging (Emma).</li>
						<li>The Baby Name Voyager site frequently becomes unresponsive if no result is found. When this happens, ask students to reload the page.</li>
						<li>Some students may get frustrated by not finding their own name in the Baby Name Voyager. Point out to students that only a small percentage of all names are listed. A larger text file (available  <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/5-big-data/yob2014.txt">here</a>) contains all names for at least 5 births. You might check this file to see if your students' names are in it -- or even challenge a student to create an app that tests names against this data.</li>
						<li>You may want to draw some connections to prior units' social implications labs, since there have been discussions about large data sets, notably a discussion about privacy concerns in personally-identifiable information.</li>
						<li>During this lab, keep a lookout for news reports that involve the analysis of large data sets, for appropriate Computing In The News material.</li>

                        <li>As students saw with higher-order-functions in Unit 3, Snap<em>!</em> uses a blank input slot to represent the variable element of a function. You may need to review this. There is a description in the orange box toward the top of <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/old/3-three-key-list-ops/2-map.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">"The <code>Map</code> Block" page in Unit 3</a> (starting with "The gray ring...").</li>
                        <li>
                            You may wish to suggest other functions for students to graph with their app, such as:
