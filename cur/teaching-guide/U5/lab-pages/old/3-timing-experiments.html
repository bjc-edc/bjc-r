        <h2>Lab 3: Timing Experiments</h2>
		<div class="todo">
            <p>
                From Dan: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Given a ton of card decks, have the class figure out the fastest INDIVIDUAL time to start from a shuffled deck to a sorted deck (students can choose what "in order" means for that, but it has to be a unique order, so "reds in front of blacks" isn't enough — people always choose to sort by either rank or suit).  Talk about the different algorithms that evolved, and what were fastest.</li>
                    <li>Tell the class they can work as a TEAM to sort a shuffled desk the fastest.  The teams can be any size. Let them continue to adjust the algorithms and sizes of teams and personnel on the teams to achieve the fastest scores.  Talk about the different algorithms that evolved, and what were fastest.</li>
                </ul>
				This is a great introduction to concurrent algorithms, and allows the kids to come up with algorithms on their own, and builds team spirit. It's really fun and useful to plot the fastest times vs the number of players, and talk about amdahl's law. (Added in by MF) Brian suggested the placement in the middle of Lab 3.
            </p>
		</div>
				
        <p>Students compare and contrast algorithms based on their code and running times. Students write a program that times a computation in milliseconds and then time several processes and compare the results. Students also learn the differences between algorithms that run in reasonable time and algorithms that do not. Algorithms that run in reasonable time are further divided into <em>constant</em> time processes (ones in which computing time is not affected by the magnitude of the input), <em>linear</em> time (computing time proportional to the magnitude of the input), and <em>polynomial</em> time (slower than linear, computing time proportional to some polynomial function of the input).</p>

							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>
                                    Some students may get stuck understanding Jasmine's method for adding the numbers, along with the connection to the formula <span class="katex">\frac{n(n+1)}{2}</span>. 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Use additional examples besides 13 and 50 to help, such as the numbers from 1 to 7. In the end, only the accuracy of the formula is necessary to continue.</li>
                                        <li>Another helpful explanation, besides the one on this page, is that the average of the numbers from 1 to <em>n</em> is  <span class="katex">\frac{n+1}{2}</span>, and there are <em>n</em> numbers in the list.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>The timing of the two algorithms may seem the same at first. Continue to grow the size of the input until students see a very clear difference between the two, then ask students why there might be a large difference. Related, ask them why there might not have been very much difference for smaller inputs.</li>
                                <li>A likely student question is whether a good algorithm can't just be badly
        programmed.  The answer is yes, but generally, poor-but-correct programming of an algorithm will change the running time only by a constant factor.  My program might always take twice as long as your program, but both of our programs will grow linearly or quadratically or exponentially as the input size grows.  Something you should understand (and your students should come to understand) is that constant factors don't matter very much.  If my program is too slow by a factor of two, I can just wait a year and buy a new computer. But if my algorithm is quadratic instead of linear, that will still be significant no matter how fast computers become.  That's why we talk about analysis of <em>algorithms</em> rather than analysis of <em>programs</em>.</li>

                        </li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Timing experiments are unlikely to give the desired results for small input sizes, because the actual algorithm will be swamped by things like the time Snap<em>!</em> spends switching from one thread to another.  Encourage students to use input sizes of at least 100, better yet 1000, if the running time isn't too slow.  They should compare results for <em>n</em> = 100 versus <em>n</em> = 200, or 1000 versus 2000. You're aiming for times of a minute or two, not just a few milliseconds.</li>
                                <li>One point not explicitly taught is that generating a list of <em>n</em> values has to take at least linear time, because adding a value to a list (using <code>add</code>  or <code>in front of</code>) takes time.  How much time?  An exact answer is tricky, but "constant time" is close enough.  (The real truth is "constant time on average." If a particular student insists, send them to the Wikipedia article on "amortized analysis," but note that the first sentence of that article is "This article may be confusing or unclear to readers.")</li>
                                <li>This is unlikely to come up, but if a students use <em>both</em> <code>add</code>  and <code>in front of</code> on the same list, the result will be extremely poor performance, quadratic time or worse. Don't tell students that, but if it comes up, just tell them to be consistent in their programming style. This matters because Snap<em>!</em> uses two different ways to store lists, and switching styles forces Snap<em>!</em> to convert between the two.</li>

                            <strong>Discussion:</strong> What ways are there to analyze an algorithm's efficiency?

                            	<li>How can you use a timer to gather evidence about an algorithm's efficiency?</li>
								<li>In an algorithm's code, what is evidence that the algorithm has constant time?</li>

								<li>What information can you learn from a graph of an algorithm's runtime plotted against its input size?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Algorithms are classified by how fast they execute <em>on large inputs</em>. There are very slow constant-time algorithms, and very fast algorithms for small inputs that become unreasonable for large inputs. The analysis of an algorithm is generally done by counting atomic (constant-time) steps, not just by timing.  Timing is useful in gathering evidence but is not proof that an algorithm is of a certain category.</li>
                                <li>If you have other instances (perhaps of student work) where different algorithms solve the same problem, highlight them here. It's very likely two student algorithms for the same problem will be of the same category, but the analysis is still useful. Morgan and Jasmine's algorithms are specifically built to solve the same problem in different categories.</li>
                                <li>Some students may feel Morgan's algorithm is constant time because they count the call to <code>list from</code> as one step, but note that the creation of a list is a linear-time function, so an algorithm that contains it can be (at best) linear time. The algorithm used by the <code>list from</code> block is a simple recursion. If students dig into it, follow along, it will give a good preview to what will happen in Units 6 and 7.</li>
                                <li>The binary search algorithm to find an item in a sorted list takes<em> logarithmic time,</em> which is more than constant time but a lot less than linear time. Students are <strong>not required</strong> to know specifically about logarithmic time, but they should be able to see that the linear search takes linear time, and the binary search takes less than that, but still not constant time. Whether you talk about logarithmic time should depend on how far advanced in algebra your students are. You can consider lists whose sizes are powers of 2 and ask how many times you have to cut the size in half before you get to a single item.</li>
                                <li>(Similarly, a good sorting algorithm takes<em> n log n</em> time, whereas an obvious sorting algorithm takes quadratic (<em>n<sup>2</sup></em>) time. This is a huge difference when sorting a lot of data. Note that we consider <em>log n</em> and <em>n log n</em> run times as "polynomial" even though these are not really polynomial functions. They are <em>bounded by</em> polynomial functions: <em>n</em> is bigger than <em>log n</em> for large <em>n,</em>, and <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> is bigger than <em>n log n.</em>)</li>

            from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/resources/BJC-Curriculum-Outline.pdf" target="_blank">2016 Outline</a>: Through the development of the timer program, students continue to see that programs are written to execute algorithms (<strong>EU 5.2</strong>) and also build the foundation for understanding that though algorithms can solve many computational problems, there are constraints that must be taken into consideration (<strong>EU 4.2</strong>). This lab builds toward these EUs by having students time various algorithms, building toward the idea that there are identifiable families of algorithms with similar times as a function of input size: constant, linear, quadratic, and exponential. Students are required to build a timer procedure and apply it to several algorithms from earlier units.</div>
