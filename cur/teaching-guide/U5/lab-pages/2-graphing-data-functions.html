        <h2>Optional Programming Lab 2: Graphing Data and Functions</h2>
        <div class="todo">This grapher <em>should</em>, when we revise, become the grapher used in the U4 analysis of Burger whatever.</div>
		<p>It is easier to compare the efficiency of the two algorithms if we can visualize the data we get from timing experiments. In this lab, students create a general graphing program that plots data points on a screen whose dimensions (scale) they have determined themselves. They then work with a dataset on a classroom of 27 sixth-graders and isolate various data subsets to create graphs of height vs. weight, age vs. height, age vs. weight, etc.</p>
        <p>This graphing program also has the option of taking a function as input and producing its Cartesian graph. On the last page, students explore using the app to plot a function such as <span class="katex">-5 + (x-3)^2</span>.</p> 
        <p>
            The graphing app that students build differs from many traditional graphing programs in that it requires hovering the mouse over the stage to input the <span class="katex">x</span>-values into the function, produce the points of the graph, and plot them. This is done for two reasons, one pedagogical and one practical:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>pedagogical</strong>: inputting the <code>mouse x</code> value into the function to get the corresponding <span class="katex">y</span> values supports understanding both what this grapher is doing and the underlying mathematics of functions (e.g. unlike the <code>Graph datapoints</code> procedure, which begins with a complete set of <span class="katex">x</span> and <span class="katex">y</span> coordinates, the <code>Graph function</code> procedure needs to <em>generate</em> <span class="katex">y</span> values based on <em>inputed</em> <span class="katex">x</span> values&mdash;this is known to be a challenge in understanding functions for beginning algebra students)</li>
                <li><strong>practical</strong>: this approach makes use of what students already know about programming (e.g. how to read the mouse location and how to adjust it based on the graph scale) rather than working through the complicated algorithm of making subdivisions necessary to get a consistent curve</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

                        <li>As students saw with higher-order-functions in Unit 3, Snap<em>!</em> uses a blank input slot to represent the variable element of a function. You may need to review this.
