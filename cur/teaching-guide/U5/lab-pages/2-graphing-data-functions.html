        <h2>Programming Lab 2: Graphing Data and Functions</h2>
        <div class="todo">This grapher <em>should</em>, when we revise, become the grapher used in the U4 analysis of Burger whatever.</div>
		<p>It is easier to compare the efficiency of the two algorithms if we can visualize the data we get from timing experiments. In this lab, students create a general graphing program that plots data points on a screen whose dimensions (scale) they have determined themselves. This graphing program also has the option of taking a function as input and producing its Cartesian graph.</p>
		<p>Students will use this grapher to visualize  timing data on their algorithms, and will later use it for some of their data-processing explorations.</p>
