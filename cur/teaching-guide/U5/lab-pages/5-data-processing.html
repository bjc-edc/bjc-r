        <h2>Programming Lab 5: Data Processing</h2>
		<p>Students import data available on the Internet, graph and analyze the data, identify questions to ask about the data, and process the data  to answer their questions. If there is time (or as necessary), students can also time the algorithms they use for various data set sizes, evaluate the algorithms' processing time for various data set sizes, and even refine the algorithms to process larger data sets more quickly.</p>  

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
