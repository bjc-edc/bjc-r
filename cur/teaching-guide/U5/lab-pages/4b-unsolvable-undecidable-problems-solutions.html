            <ol>
                <li>
                    If Adam is a False-Teller, then they are <em>not</em> from the same family, and so Eve is a Truthteller. If Adam is a Truthteller, then they <em>are</em> from the same family, and still Eve is a Truthteller. Either way, Eve is a Truthteller, but there is no way to know for sure which family Adam is from.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Yes. Truthteller</li>
                        <li>No.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Derek says yes. If he is from the Truthteller family, then he'll tell the truth and say yes. If he is from the False-Teller family, then he'll lie and say yes. </li>
                <li>Derek says no. If he is from the Truthteller family, then he'll tell the truth and say no. If he is from the False-Teller family, then he'll lie and say no.</li>
                <li>Betsy's statement is a paradox; it is a logical contradiction that is neither true nor false. If the statement "The statement I'm making right now is false" is true, then is has to be false because the true statement says it is false. However, if the statement is false, then because it says it is false, it must be true. Neither makes sense.</li>
                <li>
                    Questions that will help you determine whether a person is a Truthteller or a False-Teller are those that the two will answer differently.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            For example: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Are you a person?</li>
                                <li>Is the sky blue?</li>
                                <li>Do we live on the sun?</li>
                                <li>Is the United States in Europe?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The following table shows how Adam would answer each question if he were a Truthteller or a False-Teller:
                            <table class="bordered">
                                <tr>
                                    <th>Question</th>
                                    <th>Truthteller</th>
                                    <th>False-Teller</th>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>Are you a person?</td>
                                    <td>Yes</td>
                                    <td>No</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>

                                    <td>Yes</td>
                                    <td>No</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>Do we live on the sun?</td>

                                    <td>Yes</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>Is the United States in Europe?</td>
                                    <td>No</td>
                                    <td>Yes</td>
                                </tr>
                            </table>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
                <li>Max's statement that "Min and I are both liars!" is not a contradiction, and it is not indeterminate; it is definitely resolvable. If Max were a Truthteller, then he would not say that they were both liars. So, the only possibility is that Max is a False-Teller, in which case, the statement must be a lie; so they are <em>not</em> both False-Tellers, and Min must be a Truthteller. Thus, the statement is definitely resolvable.</li>
