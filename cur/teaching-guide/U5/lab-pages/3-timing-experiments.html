        <h2>Programming Lab 3: Timing Experiments</h2>
		<p>Students time several functions, beginning with ones that take non-linear time, and graph the times against the size of the inputs.  They then write a timer program that accepts a function (and inputs) and times the computation in milliseconds and graph their program's computation time with several different inputs.  Students experiment with various functions and with different models of the same function. If time, students also time the game strategies that were developed in Lab 1.</p>
