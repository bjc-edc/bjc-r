        <h2>Programming Lab 3: Timing Experiments</h2>
		<p>Students write a timer program that accepts a function (and inputs) and times the computation in milliseconds. Students then time several processes and use the grapher that they built to graph the times against the size of the inputs and compare the results.  In this lab, students recognize <em>constant</em> time processes (ones in which computing time is not affected by the magnitude of the input), <em>linear</em> time (computing time proportional to the magnitude of the input), <em>quadratic</em> time (slower than linear, because computing time is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the input), and <em>logarithmic</em> time (faster than linear, but not constant). Because many students at this level have not studied logarithms, the last case will be seen but not treated in depth. Processes in which the time grows exponentially with the magnitude of the input will be illustrated later, with some methods for reducing the computational complexity to make these problems tractable.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>EK 4.2.1A</strong> Many problems can be solved in a reasonable time.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.1B</strong> Reasonable time means that as the input size grows, the number of steps the algorithm takes is proportional to the square (or cube, fourth power, fifth power, etc.) of the size of the input.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.1C</strong> Some problems cannot be solved in a reasonable time, even for small input sizes.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.1D</strong> Some problems can be solved but not in a reasonable time. In these cases, heuristic approaches may be helpful to find solutions in reasonable time.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4A</strong> Determining an algorithm’s efficiency is done by reasoning formally or mathematically about the algorithm.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4B</strong> Empirical analysis of an algorithm is done by implementing the algorithm and running it on different inputs.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4C</strong> The correctness of an algorithm is determined by reasoning formally or mathematically about the algorithm, not by testing an implementation of the algorithm.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4D</strong> Different correct algorithms for the same problem can have different efficiencies.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4E</strong> Sometimes, more efficient algorithms are more complex.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4F</strong> Finding an efficient algorithm for a problem can help solve larger instances of the problem.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4G</strong> Efficiency includes both execution time and memory usage.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4H</strong> Linear search can be used when searching for an item in any list; binary search can be used only when the list is sorted.</li>

                        <li><strong>EK 5.2.1E</strong> Program execution automates processes.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 5.2.1F</strong> Processes use memory, a central processing unit (CPU), and input and output.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 5.2.1G</strong> A process may execute by itself or with other processes.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 5.2.1H</strong> A process may execute on one or several CPUs.</li>
