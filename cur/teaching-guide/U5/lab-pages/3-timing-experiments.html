        <h2>Programming Lab 3: Timing Experiments</h2>
		<p>Students compare and contrast algorithms based on their code and running times. Students write a program that times a computation in milliseconds. Students then time several processes and compare the results. Students learn the differences between algorithms that run in reasonable time and algorithms that do not. Algorithms that run in reasonable time are further divided into <em>constant</em> time processes (ones in which computing time is not affected by the magnitude of the input), <em>linear</em> time (computing time proportional to the magnitude of the input), and <em>polynomial</em> time (slower than linear, computing time proportional to some polynomial function of the input).</p>

			<h4>Essential Knowledge:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>EK 4.2.1A</strong> Many problems can be solved in a reasonable time.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.1B</strong> Reasonable time means that as the input size grows, the number of steps the algorithm takes is proportional to the square (or cube, fourth power, fifth power, etc.) of the size of the input.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.1C</strong> Some problems cannot be solved in a reasonable time, even for small input sizes.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.1D</strong> Some problems can be solved but not in a reasonable time. In these cases, heuristic approaches may be helpful to find solutions in reasonable time.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4A</strong> Determining an algorithmâ€™s efficiency is done by reasoning formally or mathematically about the algorithm.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4B</strong> Empirical analysis of an algorithm is done by implementing the algorithm and running it on different inputs.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4C</strong> The correctness of an algorithm is determined by reasoning formally or mathematically about the algorithm, not by testing an implementation of the algorithm.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4D</strong> Different correct algorithms for the same problem can have different efficiencies.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4E</strong> Sometimes, more efficient algorithms are more complex.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4F</strong> Finding an efficient algorithm for a problem can help solve larger instances of the problem.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4G</strong> Efficiency includes both execution time and memory usage.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4H</strong> Linear search can be used when searching for an item in any list; binary search can be used only when the list is sorted.</li>

                    	<li><strong>EK 5.2.1A</strong> Algorithms are implemented using program instructions that are processed during program execution.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 5.2.1B</strong> Program instructions are executed sequentially.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 5.2.1C</strong> Program instructions may involve variables that are initialized and updated, read, and written.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 5.2.1D</strong> An understanding of instructions processing and program execution is useful for programming.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 5.2.1E</strong> Program execution automates processes.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 5.2.1F</strong> Processes use memory, a central processing unit (CPU), and input and output.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 5.2.1G</strong> A process may execute by itself or with other processes.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 5.2.1H</strong> A process may execute on one or several CPUs.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 5.2.1I</strong> Executable programs increase the scale of problems that can be addressed.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 5.2.1J</strong> Simple algorithms can solve a large set of problems when automated.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 5.2.1K</strong> Improvements in algorithms, hardware, and software increase the kinds of problems and the size of problems solvable by programming.</li>
