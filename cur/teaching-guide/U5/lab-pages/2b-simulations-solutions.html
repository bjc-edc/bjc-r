                <li>
                    Exercise 1:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Impractical:  Add a lane to the highway and see if that improves the traffic jams.  What if it's a carpool lane?  Etc.</li>
                        <li>Impossible:  Suppose gravity followed an inverse-cube law instead of inverse-square.  What would planetary orbits look like?</li>
                        <li>Unethical:  Infect 10 students with smallpox and measure how long it takes until the entire school catches it.  (Or, after infecting them, give them a new drug that might cure it, and see if it works.)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Exercise 2: Simulations allow performing quasi-experiments in the computer model, and the results can indicate likely results if the same experiment were made in the real world.  Visual display of information can help people understand the phenomena; for example, a computer can display a planetary orbit so the experimenter can see the result rather than just seeing equations describing the result.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pro: Computers can model the impractical, impossible, or unethical situations that would otherwise not be available for experiments.  Even when something can be done in the real world, computer modeling is generally much cheaper and faster, so many experiments can be made instead of only a few.  (For example, auto body designs are tested in simulated wind tunnels many times, until the designers think they have the optimal shape, and only then do they actually build a physical car and try it in a physical wind tunnel.)</li>
                        <li>Con:  There's only one big problem with computer modeling, but it's a crucial one:  The simplifications made in building the computer model may be more important than the developers think, and so the results may not really be correct.  This is especially likely when modeling very complex systems, in which a small error in one piece of the model may have much larger effects in other pieces.  A related problem is that sometimes the model-builders make simplifications that they <em>know</em> are importantly wrong, but they don't know how to build a better one.  For example, many economists assume that everyone in a society has perfect access to relevant information, and always behaves rationally.  This is <em>so</em> wrong that their conclusions aren't very convincing to anyone who looks at a real economy.</li>
