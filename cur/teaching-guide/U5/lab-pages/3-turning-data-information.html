		<h2>Lab 3: Turning Data into Information</h2>
        <div class="todo"><h1>Page still needs major edits to match student pages. --MF, 6/26/19</h1></div>
		<p>This lab focuses on the remaining content of AP CSP Big Idea 3: Data. Students use existing online data visualization tools to identifying patterns in data and work collaboratively to draw conclusions and summarize their findings. Several AP-style self-check questions are included to help students extend their understanding to the type of questions likely to appear on the exam.</p>

                                        <li>Where is the information in large data sets stored? How is it accessed?</li>
                                        <li>In what ways is it especially difficult to work with large data sets?</li>

                                <li>Expect a wide variety of search results from the Baby Name Voyager, and look for opportunities for students to share interesting data with others. Of particular interest may be "fad" names that were popular in specific decades (Lisa, Jennifer), and other names that were popular long ago but are re-emerging (Emma).</li>
                                <li>The Baby Name Voyager site frequently becomes unresponsive if no result is found. When this happens, ask students to reload the page.</li>
                                <li>Some students may get frustrated by not finding their own name in the Baby Name Voyager. Point out to students that only a small percentage of all names are listed. A larger text file (available  <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/old/5-big-data/yob2014.txt" title="Popular Baby Names Data List">here</a>) contains all names for at least 5 births. You might check this file to see if your students' names are in it&mdash;or even challenge a student to create an app that tests names against this data.</li>
                                <li>You may want to draw some connections to prior units' social implications labs, since there have been discussions about large data sets, notably a discussion about privacy concerns in personally-identifiable information.</li>
                                <li>During this lab, keep a lookout for news reports that involve the analysis of large data sets, for appropriate Computing In The News material.</li>

                                <li>Figuring out how to report just one column of a table can be tricky for students. They'll need to map <code>item of</code> over their dataset. For example, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/" alt="map (item (1) of ()) over (cars)" title="map (item (1) of ()) over (cars)" /> reports just the MPG of every car in the CORGIS Cars CSV Library. The <code>map</code> function is simple to understand (e.g, add 3 to every item in the list, or take the fourth item of every record in the table), but it can take time and practice to learn when and how to use it. Encourage students to take that time by talking with their partner, referring back to <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/1-introduction-to-lists/5-mapping-over-list.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 3 Lab 1 Page 4: Transforming Every List Item">Unit 3 Lab 1 Page 4: Transforming Every List Item</a> where they first learned <code>map</code>, and/or talking to other pairs.</li>
                                <li>After students design and answer their own questions, having them present their questions and solutions to the class will help everyone better appreciate the power of using higher order functions (such as <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code>) to process data and better understand how to use them with a list of lists.</li>
