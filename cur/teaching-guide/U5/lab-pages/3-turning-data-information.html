		<h2>Lab 3: Turning Data into Information</h2>
        <div class="todo"><h1>Page still needs major edits to match student pages. --MF, 6/26/19</h1></div>
		<p>This lab focuses on the remaining content of AP CSP Big Idea 3: Data. Students use existing online data visualization tools to identifying patterns in data and work collaboratively to draw conclusions and summarize their findings. Several AP-style self-check questions are included to help students extend their understanding to the type of questions likely to appear on the exam.</p>

                                <li>The Baby Name Voyager site frequently becomes unresponsive if no result is found. When this happens, ask students to reload the page.</li>
                                <li>Some students may get frustrated by not finding their own name in the Baby Name Voyager.

                                <li>Figuring out how to report just one column of a table can be tricky for students. They'll need to map <code>item of</code> over their dataset. For example, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/map-item-1-of-over-cars.png" alt="map (item (1) of ()) over (cars)" title="map (item (1) of ()) over (cars)" /> reports just the MPG of every car in the CORGIS Cars CSV Library. The <code>map</code> function is simple to understand (e.g, add 3 to every item in the list, or take the fourth item of every record in the table), but it can take time and practice to learn when and how to use it. Encourage students to take that time by talking with their partner, referring back to <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/2-contact-list/5-mapping-over-list.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 3 Lab 2 Page 5: Transforming Every List Item">Unit 3 Lab 2 Page 5: Transforming Every List Item</a> where they first learned <code>map</code>, and/or talking to other pairs.</li>
                                <li>After students design and answer their own questions, having them present their questions and solutions to the class will help everyone better appreciate the power of using higher order functions (such as <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code>) to process data and better understand how to use them with a list of lists.</li>

                    	<li><strong>Learning Goal:</strong> Students should develop skill at reading and writing code with nested function calls.</li>
						<li><strong>Tips:</strong> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cut from 2.4...
                                    <p><strong>Pipe.</strong>  There are, in general, three ways to denote calling a bunch of reporters, each taking the result of the previous one as an input.  We generally favor <em>nesting</em> function calls: f(g(x)).  The trouble with nesting, for students, is that the function they see first in the code is called last -- it's the <em>innermost</em> function -- <em>g</em> in the f(g(x)) example -- that's called first.</p>
                                    <p>The <code>pipe</code> is just another representation of the same function calls, but with the one that's called first shown first.  It'd be <code>pipe (x) (g) (f)</code> to compute f(g(x)).</p>
                                    <p>A third way to present the same idea is to use temporary variables to hold intermediate results:</p>
                                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/divisors-sets.png" />
                                    <p>Students can do whatever makes them comfortable, but they should give nesting a try, and give pipe a try, before they settle on sequential <code>set</code>s of temporary variables.  But you can show them a page with the same function done all three ways, and they can use the sequential one to help them understand the other two.</p>

                <li><strong>DAT-2.B.2:</strong> Changes and deletions made to metadata do not change the primary data.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.B.3:</strong> Metadata are used for finding, organizing, and managing information.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.B.4:</strong> Metadata can increase the effective use of data or data sets by providing additional information.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.B.5:</strong> Metadata allow data to be structured and organized.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.C.1:</strong> The ability to process data depends on the capabilities of the users and their tools.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>DAT-2.C.2:</strong> Data sets pose challenges regardless of size, such as:
                    <ul>

                <li><strong>DAT-2.C.3:</strong> Depending on how data were collected, they may not be uniform. For example, if users entered data into an open field, the way they choose to abbreviate, spell, or capitalize something may vary from user to user.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.C.4:</strong> <em>Cleaning data</em> is a process that makes the data uniform without changing its meaning (e.g., replacing all equivalent abbreviations, spellings, and capitalizations with the same word).</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.C.5:</strong> Problems of bias are often created by the type or source of data being collected. Bias is not eliminated by simply collecting more data.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.C.6:</strong> The size of a data set affects the amount of information that can be extracted from it.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.C.7:</strong> Large data sets are difficult to process using a single computer and may require parallel systems.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.C.8:</strong> Scalability of systems is an important consideration when working with data sets, as the computational capacity of a system affects how data sets can be processed and stored.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.D.1:</strong> Programs can be used to process data to acquire information.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.D.2:</strong> Tables, diagrams, text, and other visual tools can be used to communicate insight and knowledge gained from data.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.D.4:</strong> Data filtering systems are important tools for finding information and recognizing patterns in data.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.D.5:</strong> Programs such as spreadsheets help efficiently organize and find trends in information.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>DAT-2.D.6:</strong> Some processes that can be used to extract or modify information from data include the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>transforming every element of a data set, such as doubling every element in a list, or extracting the parent's email from every student record</li>
                        <li>filtering a data set, such as keeping only the positive numbers from a list, or keeping only students who signed up for band from a record of all the students</li>
                        <li>combining or comparing data in some way, such as adding up a list of numbers, or finding the student who has the highest GPA</li>
                        <li>visualizing a data set through a chart, graph, or other visual representation</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.E.1:</strong> Programs are used in an iterative and interactive way when processing information to allow users to gain insight and knowledge about data.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.E.2:</strong> Programmers can use programs to filter and clean digital data, thereby gaining insight and knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.E.3:</strong> Combining data sources, clustering data, and classifying data are parts of the process of using programs to gain insight and knowledge from data.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.E.4:</strong> Insight and knowledge can be obtained from translating and transforming digitally represented information.</li>
                <li><strong>DAT-2.E.5:</strong> Patterns can emerge when data are transformed using programs.</li>
            </ul>
