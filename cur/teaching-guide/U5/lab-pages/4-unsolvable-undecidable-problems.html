        <h2>Lab 4: Unsolvable and Undecidable Problems</h2>
		<p>In earlier labs of this unit, we've explored <em>practical</em> limits to computation. In some cases, it's easy to program a simple algorithm for a problem, but the program would take centuries to solve the problem even for not-so-big input values. Students often find that idea easy to understand (although they may not immediately see why an exponential-time algorithm will withstand even dramatic speedups in computer hardware). This lab asks them to understand something harder: that some problems can't be solved, period.</p>
		<div class="sidenote">We already know enough about quantum computing to understand that it doesn't influence solvability.</div>
        <p>Students may find it hard to accept the idea that some problems are unsolvable <em>in principle.</em> What if some entirely new model of computation comes along that is not just faster but different in kind, the way quantum computing is different today? Perhaps something like "Tachyonic computing" (we made up this name for a technology that doesn't exist now) would allow us to solve these problems? To help students access the idea of an unanswerable question, they solve Liar/Truthteller logic puzzles to see that some are tricky but solvable, some set up inherently contradictory situations in which neither true nor false can apply (paradoxical), and a third kind we just don't have enough information to say what the solution is (undecidable). This demonstrates that there exist problems for which truth or falsity can apply but for which the state cannot (ever) be logically determined. The first page is not about computers or algorithms, but these ideas about logic build toward the second page, which <em>is</em> about algorithms and relies on student understanding of proof by contradiction and the idea of an unanswerable question.</p>
		<!--		<p>Some problems  look like they should have clear and definitive yes/no or true/false answers but, in actuality, don't. In simple cases, the lack of a definitive answer is the result of a paradox, and students can complete the proof to show that the "answer" doesn't exist because the statement is <em>neither</em> true <em>nor</em> false. But situations also exist in which it <em>could</em> be either, but we don't know which. Those fall into two categories. Computational problems can be so difficult that no solution <em>has</em> been found, but it's not clear that no solution<em> could</em> potentially be found some day. Others have been shown to be undecidable: we can prove that we will <em>never</em> have a way to solve the problem. </p>
		<p>As an introduction to this challenging content, students solve Liar/Truthteller logic puzzles to see that some are tricky but solvable, and others set up inherently contradictory situations in which neither T nor F can apply. They also explore the halting problem—can an algorithm be developed that will check <em>any</em> other algorithm to see if it will halt and return a result—to appreciate solvable vs. unsolvable and undecidable problems.</p>

                                <li>The student page uses the slightly awkward "false-teller" to avoid digressions into the psychology of liars, though <em>you</em> may enjoy Martin Gardner's discussion of the "which way to the village" problem in <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/hexaflexagons-and-other-mathematical-diversions-the-first-scientific-american-book-of-puzzles-games/oclc/18018285" target="_blank" title="Hexaflexagons and other mathematical diversions: the first Scientific American book of puzzles & games">Hexaflexagons and other mathematical diversions: the first Scientific American book of puzzles &amp; games</a>.

                                <li>It's crucial to the proof that the function given as input to <code>halts?</code> takes an input and that <code>tester</code> is written so that it tests that function <em>with itself as input.</em> It's tempting to leave out the second input in <code>halts?</code>, but this is how we get the self-reference that leads to a contradiction proving that there can be no such <code>halts?</code> function.</li>

                                    <div id="hint-hilbert" class="collapse">
                                        <p>In 1928, mathematician David Hilbert posed the "decision problem," asking whether any statement in certain mathematical theories (in the sense of formal axiom systems, not "things we don't know for sure") can be proven true or false. (This is <em>not</em> one of the numbered list of problems Hilbert famously posed in 1900 as tasks for the coming century.) Turing's work was motivated in large part by this problem; his insight was that to solve the problem, he would need a way to describe what "can be" done effectively. In short, he had to invent the idea of an algorithm. He did this with what is now called the <em>Turing machine,</em> a kind of thought-experiment computer too primitive to be of practical use, but just for that reason, simple enough to reason about.</p>
                                        <p>Turing's 1936 paper was truly remarkable. Not only did he come up with the idea of effective algorithms, he also had to invent the idea that a computer program (the concrete representation of an algorithm) is also data, on which the computer can operate.</p>
                                        <p>(Turing was actually anticipated, slightly, by Alonzo Church, the patron saint of Snap<em>!</em>, who developed a very different formalization, namely the <em>lambda calculus,</em> the  study of functions as data. It's Church's work that led to John McCarthy's invention of the Lisp programming language and to the functional programming style central to BJC. Turing is better known than Church partly because of his war work, but also because the imperative, sequential programming style is more widely understood than functional programming. This is just starting to change because of the importance of functional programming to parallel computation.)</p>

                                </li>
                                <li>The proof of the halting theorem is much easier for us than it was for Turing, because we have the advantage of an advanced programming language that allows procedures to be used as input values. What Turing had to work with was a particularly simple-minded machine language encoded with ones and zeros. He had to work out how to encode a program and then how to write <em>another</em> program that could examine the first one. Church's proof of the Halting Theorem looked much more like ours than like Turing's, because Church created a notation for functions of functions. In other words, <em>the proof depends on the fact that</em> <code>tester</code> <em>is a higher order function</em> (it can take functions as inputs).</li>
                                <li>In order to give you, the teacher, discretion about what is or isn't appropriate in your district and for your students, the student page does <em>not</em> describe the end of  Turing's life. Turing was hounded to death—sentenced to chemical castration—by the British government because of his homosexuality. This awful truth about social intolerance can become an important part of classroom discussion if your teaching situation permits it.</li>
                                <li><strong>Extension Activity:</strong> Although it's not directly related to this lab, the story of how Turing enabled the Allied victory against the Nazis is thrilling and engaging. It's told, for example, in the book <a href="http://www.turing.org.uk/book/" target="new" title="Alan Turing: The Enigma"><em>Alan Turing: The Enigma</em></a> by Andrew Hodges. (The link also gives information about other resources on Turing.) Researching Turing's life could be a good extra credit assignment that doesn't involve programming.  Students may also be interested in Joan Clarke, the only woman among the Bletchley Park mathematicians. (The code breakers also employed a large number of women in more clerical positions.)</li>
