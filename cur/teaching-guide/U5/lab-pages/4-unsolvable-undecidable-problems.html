        <h2>Lab 4: Unsolvable and Undecidable Problems</h2>
		<div class="todo">From Dan: <ul>
		    <li>Given a ton of card decks, have the class figure out the fastest INDIVIDUAL time to start from a shuffled deck to a sorted deck (students can choose what "in order" means for that, but it has to be a unique order, so "reds in front of blacks" isn't enough — people always choose to sort by either rank or suit).  Talk about the different algorithms that evolved, and what were fastest.</li><li>Tell the class they can work as a TEAM to sort a shuffled desk the fastest.  The teams can be any size. Let them continue to adjust the algorithms and sizes of teams and personnel on the teams to achieve the fastest scores.  Talk about the different algorithms that evolved, and what were fastest.</li></ul>This is a great introduction to concurrent algorithms, and allows the kids to come up with algorithms on their own, and builds team spirit. It’s really fun and useful to plot the fastest times vs the number of players, and talk about amdahl’s law. (Added in by MF) Brian suggested the placement in the middle of Lab 2.</div>
        <div class="todo">Need to address: EK 4.1.2F The language used to express an algorithm can affect characteristics such as clarity or readability but not whether an algorithmic solution exists. --MF, 11/16/17</div>
		
	
		<p>The idea that some problems do not have solutions is credible enough to students, but the idea that some cannot ever have solutions, and that we can prove that, is harder. We introduce the notion through a slightly different idea at first. Students solve Liar/Truthteller logic puzzles to see that some are tricky but solvable and others set up inherently contradictory situations in which neither true nor false can apply. Then they see the more complex idea: problems for which truth or falsity can apply, but for which the state cannot (ever) be logically determined. Last, they explore the halting problem: Can an algorithm be developed that will check any other algorithm to see if it will halt and return a result?</p>
		<p>In earlier labs of this unit, we've explored <em>practical</em> limits to computation. In some cases, it's easy to program a simple algorithm for a problem, but the program would take centuries to solve the problem even for not-so-big input values. Students often find that idea easy to understand (although they may not immediately see why an exponential-time algorithm will withstand even dramatic speedups in computer hardware). This lab asks them to understand something harder: that some problems can't be solved, period.</p>
		<p>Students may find it hard to accept that some problems are unsolvable <em>in principle.</em> What if some entirely new model of computation comes along, not just faster, but different in kind, the way quantum computing is different (but already rather well understood in principle) today? Tachyonic computing, or some such thing?</p>
		<p><strong>Page 1: Logical Inconsistency.</strong></p>
		<p>It's to address that difficulty that we begin with a detour into logic puzzles&mdash;specifically, liar-and-truthteller puzzles. (The student page uses the slightly awkward "false-teller" to avoid digressions into the psychology of liars, but you might want to look up Martin Gardner's <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/hexaflexagons-and-other-mathematical-diversions-the-first-scientific-american-book-of-puzzles-games/oclc/18018285" target="_blank">discussion</a> of the "which way to the village" problem that ends with the delightful suggested question, "Did you know that they're giving away free beer in the village?" You ignore the answer and follow the native.)  In this context, students find the idea of an unanswerable question easier to grasp.</p>
		<p>But paradox isn't the important thing for students to learn on that first page. (The unsolvable problem presented on the second page isn't paradoxical.) Rather, it's <em><strong>proof by contradiction</strong></em> that's important. Gamal explains this technique in the first dialog. If your students have studied enough algebra, remind them of the proof that &radic;2 isn't a ratio of integers.</p>
		<p> <strong>Page 2: An Undecidable Problem.</strong></p>
		<p>The second page starts by introducing Alan Turing. No serious introduction to computer science can avoid discussing Turing, the patron saint of computer science, and arguably the founder of the field. (Why not Babbage and Lovelace? Because computer science isn't about the design and construction of computers; it's about a general understanding of what computers can accomplish. That's what Turing, along with the less-well-known Alonzo Church, started.)</p>
		<p>The story of how Turing enabled the Allied victory against the Nazis is thrilling and engaging. It's told, among other sources, in the book <em>Alan Turing: The Enigma</em> by Andrew Hodges. (The link also gives information about other resources on Turing.) Researching Turing's life could be a good extra credit assignment that doesn't involve programming.  Students may also be interested in Joan Clarke, the only woman among the Bletchley Park mathematicians. (The code breakers also employed a large number of women in more clerical positions.)</p>
		<p>The student page does <em>not</em> go into the end of  Turing's life: He was hounded to death by an ungrateful British government because of his homosexuality. We omit that part of the story because we're aware that there are parts of the United States where even teaching evolution is considered controversial. But if you are lucky enough to teach in an environment that will allow it, we urge you to make his sentencing to chemical castration because of social intolerance part of the classroom discussion.</p>
		<p><strong>The Halting Theorem</strong></p>
		<p>In 1928, mathematician David Hilbert posed the "decision problem," asking whether any statement in certain mathematical theories (in the sense of formal axiom systems, not "things we don't know for sure") can be proven true or false. (This is <em>not</em> one of the numbered list of problems Hilbert famously posed in 1900 as tasks for the coming century.) Turing's work was motivated in large part by this problem; his insight was that to solve the problem, he would need a way to describe what "can be" done effectively. In short, he had to invent the idea of an algorithm. He did this with what is now called the <em>Turing machine,</em> a kind of computer too primitive to be of practical use, but just for that reason, simple enough to reason about.</p>
		<p>Turing's 1936 paper was truly remarkable. Not only did he come up with the idea of effective algorithms, he also had to invent the idea that a computer program (the concrete representation of an algorithm) is also data, on which the computer can operate.</p>
		<p>(Turing was actually anticipated, slightly, by Alonzo Church, the patron saint of Snap<em>!</em>, who developed a very different formalization, namely the <em>lambda calculus,</em> the  study of functions as data. It's Church's work that led to John McCarthy's invention of the Lisp programming language and to the functional programming style central to BJC. Turing is better known than Church partly because of his war work, but also because the imperative, sequential programming style is more widely understood than functional programming. This is just starting to change because of the importance of functional programming to parallel computation.)</p>
		<p><strong>Proving the Halting Theorem</strong></p>
		<p>As suggested above, we use proof by contradiction to show that a certain question can't be answered <em>in general:</em> Will a certain computer program, given a certain input, report a result in a finite amount of time?</p>
		<p>
        	The "in general" part is important. Of course we can answer the question for certain particular programs. This one halts for any input:<br />
        	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/three-fn.png" alt="three(x) reports 3">
        </p>
		<p>
            This one never halts for any input:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/loop-fn.png" width="158" height="137" alt="loop(x): forever [wait 1 secs]">
        </p>
		<p>
            And this one halts (reports a value) for any input except 87:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/weird-fn.png" width="158" height="222" alt="weird(x): if (x=87) then forever [wait 1 secs]; report 3">
        </p>
		<p>The question is whether we can devise a test that will tell us whether <em>any</em> given function will report a value for <em>any</em> given input. To make a proof by contradiction, we start by supposing that there is such a <code>halts?</code> function. Then we show that there has to be at least one function, and one input to that function, for which <code>halts?</code> fails: If we call <code>halts?</code> with the function <code>tester</code> as both the function to be tested and the input to give that function, any result reported by <code>halts?</code> will be wrong.</p>
		<p>Showing that the result has to be wrong involves a case analysis like the ones used to solve the logic puzzles on page 1. Suppose <code>halts?</code> reports <code>True</code>, telling us that <code>tester(tester)</code> succeeds at reporting a value. Then <code>tester</code> takes the first branch of the <code>if</code>, and so it loops forever. (We used <code>repeat until</code> to create the infinite loop, but that's not important; it could just be <code>forever</code> as in the pictures above.) Thus <code>halts?</code> gave the wrong answer. Now suppose instead that <code>halts?</code> reports <code>False</code>, thereby claiming that <code>tester(tester)</code> loops forever. But in that case, <code>tester</code> takes the <code>else</code> branch, and reports <code>True</code>. (Don't be confused; it doesn't matter <em>what</em> value <code>tester</code> reports, just that it reports <em>some</em> value. But it <em>does</em> matter what value <code>halts?</code> reports.)</p>
		<p>The proof is much easier for us than it was for Turing, because we have the advantage of an advanced programming language that allows procedures to be used as input values! What Turing had to work with was a particularly simple-minded machine language, encoded in the ones and zeros some people like so much. He had to work out how to encode a program, and then how to write <em>another</em> program that could examine the first one. Church's proof of the Halting Theorem looked much more like ours than like Turing's, because he had, and bequeathed to us, a notation for functions of functions.</p>
<!--		<p>Some problems  look like they should have clear and definitive yes/no or true/false answers but, in actuality, don't. In simple cases, the lack of a definitive answer is the result of a paradox, and students can complete the proof to show that the "answer" doesn't exist because the statement is <em>neither</em> true <em>nor</em> false. But situations also exist in which it <em>could</em> be either, but we don't know which. Those fall into two categories. Computational problems can be so difficult that no solution <em>has</em> been found, but it's not clear that no solution<em> could</em> potentially be found some day. Others have been shown to be undecidable: we can prove that we will <em>never</em> have a way to solve the problem. </p>
		<p>As an introduction to this challenging content, students solve Liar/Truthteller logic puzzles to see that some are tricky but solvable, and others set up inherently contradictory situations in which neither T nor F can apply. They also explore the halting problem—can an algorithm be developed that will check <em>any</em> other algorithm to see if it will halt and return a result—to appreciate solvable vs. unsolvable and undecidable problems.</p>
