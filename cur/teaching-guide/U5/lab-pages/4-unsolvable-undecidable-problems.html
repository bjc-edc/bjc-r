        <h2>Programming Lab 4: Unsolvable and Undecidable Problems</h2>
		<p>Some problems  look like they should have clear and definitive yes/no or true/false answers but, in actuality, don't. In simple cases, the lack of a definitive answer is the result of a paradox, and students can complete the proof to show that the &quot;answer&quot; doesn't exist because the statement is <em>neither</em> true <em>nor</em> false. But situations also exist in which it <em>could</em> be either, but we don't know which. Those fall into two categories. Computational problems can be so difficult that no solution <em>has</em> been found, but it's not clear that no solution<em> could</em> potentially be found some day. Others have been shown to be undecidable: we can prove that we will <em>never</em> have a way to solve the problem. </p>
		<p>As an introduction to this challenging content, students solve Liar/Truthteller logic puzzles to see that some are tricky but solvable, and others set up inherently contradictory situations in which neither T nor F can apply. They also explore the halting problem—can an algorithm be developed that will check <em>any</em> other algorithm to see if it will halt and return a result—to appreciate solvable vs. unsolvable and undecidable problems.</p> 
        <div class="todo"><h3>Endorsement version:</h3>The idea that some problems do not have solutions is credible enough to students, but the idea that some cannot ever have solutions, and that we can prove that, is harder. We introduce the notion through a slightly different idea at first. Students solve Liar/Truthteller logic puzzles to see that some are tricky but solvable and others set up inherently contradictory situations in which neither true nor false can apply. Then they see the more complex idea: problems for which truth or falsity can apply, but for which the state cannot (ever) be logically determined. They explore the halting problem: Can an algorithm be developed that will check any other algorithm to see if it will halt and return a result? </div>
