        <h2>Social Implications Lab 7: Copyright; Media and Sharing; Patents</h2>
        <p>Software patents are controversial. In the US, software was generally not patentable until a 1981 Supreme Court decision. Students explore what it means to invent something, and why software might or might not be considered differently from machinery. The simultaneous invention of the telephone by several people is used as an example to debunk the apple-on-head, flash-of-insight myth.</p>
        <p>The digital storage of information makes the marginal cost of a perfect copy zero. In principle that shouldn't affect the rights of artists, but in practice, many people feel free to copy media both for their own use and to give to friends. When classes are polled on this topic, most or all hands go up both for "who thinks it's wrong to pirate music or movies" and for "who has pirated music or movies?" This is a springboard into a class discussion of how laws have changed, how artists should be supported, and the use of encryption to enforce copyright.</p> 

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
			The eight lab pages are fairly heavy reading and some discussion. You and your students may have preferences about which of these topics to discuss deeply and which only to review. <!--X or X days (X-X minutes).--> Expected times to complete follow:
			  <ul>
				<li>One class period for first three lab pages: 15 minutes  on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/7-copyrights-and-patents/1-copyright.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Copyright or Patent?</a>; 5 minutes on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/7-copyrights-and-patents/2-gray.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Strokes of Genius?</a>; 25 minutes on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/7-copyrights-and-patents/3-inventions.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">How Inventions Happen</a>.</li>
				<li>40-50 minutes (one class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/7-copyrights-and-patents/4-software.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Software Patents.</a></li>
				<li>Two to three class periods for lab pages 5, 6, 7, and 8. These pages are  all reading. Depending on your class, you might create groups, assign each group a page to study and discuss, and then have a second day for reporting to the whole class, or you might do more in depth work on each page. Because you have various options, no times are assigned to these pages. Note: Pages 5 and 6 are background information to inform the deeper discussion on pages 7 and 8.</li>

        <h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>You might ask students to look into news for current articles on copyrights and patents.</li>
                <li>Look up &quot;patent troll&quot; in Wikipedia. The page is too polysyllabic to assign to students, but it'll help you lead a discussion of Page 4 (Software Patents).</li>
                <li>Although students are not directly assigned this reading, you might read <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=213" target="_blank">Chapter 6 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a>. In particular, <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=213" target="_blank">"Automated Crimes-Automated Justice" (pages 195-199)</a> is about the music industry's tactic of filing lawsuits against individuals for piracy. <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=231" target="_blank">"Forbidden Technology" (pages 213-218)</a> addresses the anti-circumvention provision of the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h3>Students will:</h3>
        <!-- <div class="sidenoteBig">
        	<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
        	<ul>
            	<li></li>

        </div> -->
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Come to a better understanding of how inventions come about, and how ideas are protected.</li>
                <li>Students will debate how the protection of ideas might also limit as well as promote creativity.</li>
            </ul>
    </div> 
              
        
        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Be careful about the language you use. Words like &quot;pirate&quot; prejudge the issues; point out to the class that advocates for both sides of controversial issues try to set the terms for the debate. In particular, in BJC we avoid the term &quot;intellectual property,&quot; which makes an analogy to real property and, as explained on page 7 (The Social Bargain), distorts the original purpose of copyrights and patents.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pages 1, 2, 3: Copyright or Patent?, Strokes of Genius?, and How Inventions Happen.</strong> You may want to use some time for brief review of the content. Deeper discussion and more controversy is likely to follow in later labs.
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Page 4: Software Patents.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apple holds a patent on curved corners for smartphone cases, and has aggressively sued iPhone competitors such as Samsung.  Ask the class to discuss whether they think this should be a patentable idea.</li>
                        <li>If the class tends to think that <em>no</em> software patents should be allowed, ask them to consider the RSA patent (now expired) covering the public key encryption algorithm that made online commerce possible. The patent wasn't on the broad idea of public-key encryption, but on a particular non-invertible function using prime numbers whose development required sophisticated mathematical research.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pages 5, 6, 7, and 8: Copyright, Fair Use, The Social Bargain, and Copyrights and Computers</strong>
              		 <ul>
                     <p>Here, too, your students may find some topics particularly compelling.  Depending on the style and interests of your classroom, these might be approached as discussions, formal debates, short written position statement. Deliberately supporting opposing positions can help a class see that the issues are complex.  </p>
                        <li>
                            Discussion or writing prompts:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Do you think everyone who illegally downloads music or movies deserves to be prosecuted?</strong> Students have likely encountered this issue directly in their lives. Students begin to form an argument to support a position. Later in the class, students will receive more information about the issue and engage in a short debate.</li>
                                <li><strong>Do you think that patents help or hurt medical science (or other sciences)?</strong> Developers of medicines will argue that if others can produce the drug they invented, the developer will lose money needed to develop other new drugs. An opposing view says that owning the rights to a drug can drive up prices and hurt people. You might bring in the relatively recent story of Martin Shkreli, a medical patent troll.</li>

        <h3>Hints</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Page 1:	In addition to copyright and patent, US law also protects trademarks, trade secrets, people's likenesses (e.g., photographs), the use of a geographical name to categorize certain products (such as the name &quot;Champagne&quot; for sparkling wine only from that region of France), integrated circuit layout design (which for technical reasons doesn't quite fit in either copyright or patent), plant varieties (e.g., a particular kind of apple created by selective breeding), and many other things.  We focus on copyrights and patents because they're most centrally related to computing.</li>
                <li>
                    Page 3: It's important to understand that patents are generally not issued for broad ideas such as &quot;the telephone&quot; or &quot;the steam engine&quot;; rather, the broad idea may be 100 years old before some engineer solves a detail problem that had stood in the way of widespread use. For example, the incandescent light bulb was first invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphry_Davy" target="_blank">Humphry Davy</a> (yes, that's how it's spelled) in 1802. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Swan" target="_blank">Joseph Swan</a> had a working bulb in 1860 and was issued a British patent in 1880. Edison started work on light bulbs in 1878, and was issued a US patent, for a somewhat different bulb, that year. Patent litigation between Edison and Swan went on for several years, until 1889. Both patents are for carbon filaments, which were used only until the development of brighter and longer-lasting tungsten filaments between 1904 and 1911. Edison's work was vital in making electric lighting widely available, but his specific invention didn't last long.
                    <p>A classic example in which the actual inventor of a technology lost the patent battle to a large corporation is FM radio, invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Howard_Armstrong" target="_blank">Edwin Armstrong</a> but &quot;pirated&quot; (see how disorienting that word is when applied to the winner of a dispute?) by RCA. RCA's interest in the technology, by the way, was not to make money by selling FM radios, but rather to prevent the adoption of FM so as to protect their large AM radio network. Does this make them the first patent troll?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Page 4: We point to two articles, one on each side of the software patent issue, but a web search will present many more.  But note also that &quot;each side&quot; oversimplifies the discussion; there are many people who support the general idea of software patents but also support software-specific reforms of the details.  At this point, virtually everyone, even the big companies, hate patent trolls and support anti-trolling reforms.
                    <p>The issue of software patents is relevant to all students in their role as citizens, but is particularly important for those who will end up developing software themselves, either independently or as an employee of a company. What stance will they take toward the use of their own ideas.  </p>
                </li>
                <li>Page 5: An additional or alternative curriculum resource is <a href="http://teachingcopyright.org" target="_blank">Teaching Copyright</a>, from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
                <p>Don't overlook the comparison at the bottom of the page between copyright and the idea of "cheating" in school; it might make the issues more understandable to students.</p></li>
                <li>Page 6: The EFF curriculum cited above has a lesson on fair use with specific real-life and fictional case studies.  </li>
                <li>Page 7: This discussion of the social bargain is at the heart of understanding the issues regarding copyrights and patents. The text from the US Constitution makes the bargain clear both by explaining the <em>purpose</em> of copyrights and patents (&quot;to promote the progress of science and useful arts&quot;) and the <em>limited term</em> that is crucial to achieving that purpose.  This is the standard by which all issues in this area should be judged.  (The actual text is, of course, US-specific, but the same principle is found in other countries' legal traditions also.) </li> 
                <li>
                    Page 8: This is the first time computer-specific copyright issues appear. The fact that computers can make <em>perfect</em> copies at <em>zero</em> marginal cost has destroyed what were previously important &quot;natural&quot; protections for copyright holders, and has made individual movie and music fans significant threats to them.  The widely-hated Digital Rights Management software can be understood as a response to this threat, not merely as a power grab (although it's that too).  &quot;Marginal cost&quot; is an unfamiliar term to students, but the idea is easy:  It costs a lot of money to produce a movie or a song recording in the first place, but it costs nothing to make one more copy.
                    <p>Note that, at least for sound recordings, the marginal cost has always been low.  It's been estimated that the manufacturing cost for one CD is about three cents.  But that's true only if you own a CD factory; burning a CD on your home computer costs more than that (for the blank CD).  What's new is that <em>anyone</em> can reproduce a recording at no cost, and distribute it over the Internet at zero marginal cost.  (You pay for Internet access, but generally not for each individual transmission.)</p>  
                    <p>The DMCA is specifically mentioned in the CSP Framework. You're supposed to teach that it has been &quot;a benefit and a challenge&quot; (EK 7.3.1P); perhaps you can assign a web search to find its alleged benefits.</p>
