        <h2>Social Implications Lab 7: Copyrights</h2>
        <p>Software patents are controversial. In the US, software was generally not patentable until a 1981 Supreme Court decision. Students explore what it means to invent something, and why software might or might not be considered differently from machinery. The simultaneous invention of the telephone by several people is used as an example to debunk the apple-on-head, flash-of-insight myth.</p>
        <p>The digital storage of information makes the marginal cost of a perfect copy zero. In principle that shouldn't affect the rights of artists, but in practice, many people feel free to copy media both for their own use and to give to friends. When classes are polled on this topic, most or all hands go up both for "who thinks it's wrong to pirate music or movies" and for "who has pirated music or movies?" This is a springboard into a class discussion of how laws have changed, how artists should be supported, and the use of encryption to enforce copyright.</p> 


		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
	        The 4 required lab pages could be split across 2-3 days (<strong>X-X minutes</strong>). Expected times to complete follow:
				  These pages are all reading. Depending on your class, you might create groups, assign each group a page to study and discuss, and then have a second day for reporting to the whole class, or you might do more in depth work on each page. Because you have various options, no times are assigned to these pages. Note: Pages 5 and 6 are background information to inform the deeper discussion on pages 7 and 8.

        <h3>Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>You might ask students to look into news for current articles on copyrights.</li>
                <li>Although students are not directly assigned this reading, you might read <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=213" target="_blank">Chapter 6 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a>. In particular, <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=213" target="_blank">"Automated Crimes-Automated Justice" (pages 195-199)</a> is about the music industry's tactic of filing lawsuits against individuals for piracy. <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=231" target="_blank">"Forbidden Technology" (pages 213-218)</a> addresses the anti-circumvention provision of the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act).</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Students will:</h3>

        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Come to a better understanding of how inventions come about, and how ideas are protected.</li>
                <li>Students will debate how the protection of ideas might also limit as well as promote creativity.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Your students may find some topics particularly compelling.  Depending on the style and interests of your classroom, these might be approached as discussions, formal debates, short written position statement. Deliberately supporting opposing positions can help a class see that the issues are complex.</li>
				<li>Here are some discussion or writing prompts:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Do you think everyone who illegally downloads music or movies deserves to be prosecuted?</strong> Students have likely encountered this issue directly in their lives. Students begin to form an argument to support a position. Later in the class, students will receive more information about the issue and engage in a short debate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Do you think that patents help or hurt medical science (or other sciences)?</strong> Developers of medicines will argue that if others can produce the drug they invented, the developer will lose money needed to develop other new drugs. An opposing view says that owning the rights to a drug can drive up prices and hurt people. You might bring in the relatively recent story of Martin Shkreli, a medical patent troll.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

		<h3>Tips:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Be careful about the language you use. Words like "pirate" prejudge the issues; point out to the class that advocates for both sides of controversial issues try to set the terms for the debate. In particular in BJC, we avoid the term "intellectual property," which makes an analogy to real property and, as explained on page 3 (The Social Bargain), distorts the original purpose of copyrights.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Page 1: Copyright.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An additional or alternative curriculum resource is <a href="http://teachingcopyright.org" target="_blank">Teaching Copyright</a>, from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</li>
                        <li>Don't overlook the comparison at the bottom of the page between copyright and the idea of "cheating" in school; it might make the issues more understandable to students.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The EFF curriculum cited above has a lesson on fair use with specific real-life and fictional case studies.</li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Page 3: The Social Bargain.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This discussion of the social bargain is at the heart of understanding the issues regarding copyrights and patents. The text from the US Constitution makes the bargain clear both by explaining the <em>purpose</em> of copyrights and patents ("to promote the progress of science and useful arts") and the <em>limited term</em> that is crucial to achieving that purpose.  This is the standard by which all issues in this area should be judged.  (The actual text is, of course, US-specific, but the same principle is found in other countries' legal traditions also.)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Page 4: Copyrights and Computers.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is the first time computer-specific copyright issues appear. The fact that computers can make <em>perfect</em> copies at <em>zero</em> marginal cost has destroyed what were previously important "natural" protections for copyright holders, and has made individual movie and music fans significant threats to them.  The widely-hated Digital Rights Management software can be understood as a response to this threat, not merely as a power grab (although it's that too).  "Marginal cost" is an unfamiliar term to students, but the idea is easy:  It costs a lot of money to produce a movie or a song recording in the first place, but it costs nothing to make one more copy.</li>
                        <li>Note that, at least for sound recordings, the marginal cost has always been low.  It's been estimated that the manufacturing cost for one CD is about three cents.  But that's true only if you own a CD factory; burning a CD on your home computer costs more than that (for the blank CD).  What's new is that <em>anyone</em> can reproduce a recording at no cost, and distribute it over the Internet at zero marginal cost.  (You pay for Internet access, but generally not for each individual transmission.)</li>
                        <li>The DMCA is specifically mentioned in the CSP Framework. You're supposed to teach that it has been "a benefit and a challenge" (EK 7.3.1P); perhaps you can assign a web search to find its alleged benefits.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
