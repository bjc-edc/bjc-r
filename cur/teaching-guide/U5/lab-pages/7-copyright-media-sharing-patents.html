        <h2>Social Implications Lab 7: Copyright; Media and Sharing; Patents</h2>
        <p>Software patents are controversial. In the US, software was generally not patentable until a 1981 Supreme Court decision. Students explore what it means to invent something, and why software might or might not be considered differently from machinery. The simultaneous invention of the telephone by several people is used as an example to debunk the apple-on-head, flash-of-insight myth.</p>
        <p>The digital storage of information makes the marginal cost of a perfect copy zero. In principle that shouldn't affect the rights of artists, but in practice, many people feel free to copy media both for their own use and to give to friends. When classes are polled on this topic, most or all hands go up both for "who thinks it's wrong to pirate music or movies" and for "who has pirated music or movies?" This is a springboard into a class discussion of how laws have changed, how artists should be supported, and the use of encryption to enforce copyright.</p>

                    	<li><strong>EK 1.2.5A</strong> The context in which an artifact is used determines the correctness, usability, functionality, and suitability of the artifact.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 1.2.5B</strong> A computational artifact may have weaknesses, mistakes, or errors depending on the type of artifact.</li>

                        <li><strong>EK 3.3.1A</strong> Digital data representations involve trade-offs related to storage, security, and privacy concerns.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 3.3.1B</strong> Security concerns engender trade-offs in storing and transmitting information.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 3.3.1C</strong> There are trade-offs in using lossy and lossless compression techniques for storing and transmitting data.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 3.3.1D</strong> Lossless data compression reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted but allows complete reconstruction of the original data.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 3.3.1E</strong> Lossy data compression can significantly reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted at the cost of being able to reconstruct only an approximation of the original data.</li>

                        <li><strong>EK 6.2.2B</strong> The redundancy of routing (i.e., more than one way to route data) between two points on the Internet increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 6.2.2C</strong> Hierarchy in the DNS helps that system scale.</li>

                        <li><strong>EK 6.2.2F</strong> The Internet is a packet-switched system through which digital data is sent by breaking the data into blocks of bits called packets, which contain both the data being transmitted and control information for routing the data.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 6.2.2G</strong> Standards for packets and routing include transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP).</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 6.2.2H</strong> Standards for sharing information and communicating between browsers and servers on the Web include HTTP and secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS).</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 6.2.2I</strong> The size and speed of systems affect their use.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 6.2.2J</strong> The bandwidth of a system is a measure of bit rate – the amount of data (measured in bits) that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 6.2.2K</strong> The latency of a system is the time elapsed between the transmission and the receipt of a request.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 6.3.1A</strong> The trust model of the Internet involves trade-offs.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 6.3.1B</strong> The DNS was not designed to be completely secure.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 6.3.1C</strong> Implementing cybersecurity has software, hardware, and human components.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 6.3.1D</strong> Cyber warfare and cyber crime have widespread and potentially devastating effects.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 6.3.1E</strong> Distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) compromise a target by flooding it with requests from multiple systems.</li>
                        <li><strong>EK 6.3.1F</strong> Phishing, viruses, and other attacks have human and software components.</li>
