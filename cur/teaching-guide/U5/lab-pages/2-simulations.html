        <h2>Lab 2: Models and Simulations</h2>
        <div class="todo">From Dan: <ul>
		    <li>Given a ton of card decks, have the class figure out the fastest INDIVIDUAL time to start from a shuffled deck to a sorted deck (students can choose what "in order" means for that, but it has to be a unique order, so "reds in front of blacks" isn't enough â€” people always choose to sort by either rank or suit).  Talk about the different algorithms that evolved, and what were fastest.</li><li>Tell the class they can work as a TEAM to sort a shuffled desk the fastest.  The teams can be any size. Let them continue to adjust the algorithms and sizes of teams and personnel on the teams to achieve the fastest scores.  Talk about the different algorithms that evolved, and what were fastest.</li></ul>This is a great introduction to concurrent algorithms, and allows the kids to come up with algorithms on their own, and builds team spirit. It's really fun and useful to plot the fastest times vs the number of players, and talk about amdahl's law. (Added in by MF) Brian suggested the placement in the middle of Lab 2.</div>
		
	
		<p>After a general introduction to the topic, students build a simulation to model the flipping of a coin. This introductory simulation is intended to give them experience in a simple and familiar context. Then the students will model and simulate the spread of a disease in a population. This is a very complex phenomena to study in real life, so the  virtual model and its simulation will require significant simplification. The people in the population will be colored dots (blue for healthy and red for sick). These person sprites will move at a constant speed, and the collisions between a sick and a healthy person will lead to the healthy person becoming also sick. The simulation will run until the entire population is either infected or recovered. The running time of the simulation will depend on various parameters inputted by the user, such as the population size, the percentage of the population initially sick, and the speed at which the sprites are moving. Students will adjust the parameters and formulate, refine, and test hypotheses about the resulting patterns in the spread of the disease. </p>
