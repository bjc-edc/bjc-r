        <h2>Programming Lab 1: Algorithms</h2>
		<p>Students build on their project U2L3-GuessNumber to create two variants on the Number guessing game: one where the <em>computer</em> picks the number and tells the <em>player</em> if their guesses are too high or too low; and one where the <em>player</em> picks the number and tells the <em>computer</em> if its guesses are too high or too low. Students also develop a list searching algorithm that finds a specific number in an ordered list of numbers and reports its position.</p> 
        <div class="todo">
        <div class="todo">This was originally in the student pages, but Brian and I agree that it should be in the TG only. --MF</div>
        <p>
			We're going to step away from the computer for some activities that your teacher will lead.
            <ol>
                <li>You'll use numbered cups to explore different ways to search for a number in a list of numbers.</li>
                <li>You'll think about ways to speed up this process.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
		<p>
            Keep in mind the following questions while you are working on this activity:
            <ul>
                <li>What strategies exist for finding a particular number in the fewest number of location checks?
                </li>
                <li>How many guesses would it take on average to find a number?</li>
                <li>How many guesses would it take to determine that a number didn't exist in the list at all?</li>
                <li>How much additional work will it be to find a number if N, the highest numbered cup, were to increase?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        </div>

        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
		<div><ul><li>As students work on the list searching algorithm, you may wish to discuss: "If the list is unordered, what can you do?"</li></ul></div>


        <h3>Assignments:</h3>
		<div>
        	<ul>
        		<li>
                	Students create a U5L1-GuessNumber project, which includes two new blocks:
                    <ul>
                    	<li><code>Number guessing game - player guesser</code> where the computer picks the number and tells the player if their guesses are too high or too low</li>
                    	<li><code>Number guessing game - computer guesser</code> where the player picks the number and tells the computer if its guesses are too high or too low</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Students also develop a U5L1-ListSearch project, a list searching algorithm that finds a specific number in an ordered list of numbers and reports its position.</li>
        	</ul>
