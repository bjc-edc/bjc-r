        <h2>Programming Lab 1: Algorithms</h2>
		<div class="todo">Perhaps, at some point, the entire U2L3-GuessNumber activity should move here. We're  eager to shorten U2 and the game is not essential there. For now, we're writing as if GuessNumber <em>remains</em> in U2L3.</div>
		<p>In  U2L3-GuessNumber, students built a Number Guessing game in which  the <em>computer</em> picks a number, the player tries to guess that number, and the computer tells the <em>player</em> if the guesses are too high or too low.</p>
		<p> In this lab, U5L1, students  design an algorithm and program the computer so that <em>it</em> can guess the player's secret number, and  the <em>player</em>  tells the <em>computer</em> if its guesses are too high or too low. An efficient algorithm depends on the fact that  numbers have order. Searching an ordered list to find the location of a given object is most efficiently done with essentially the same algorithm. Searching for the location of an object in an <em>unordered</em> list cannot be done the same way. The time that it takes these two algorithms to find their objects hardly matters when the lists are small, but matters a lot when the lists get large. This is students' first experience analyzing computational complexity.</p> 

		<div class="todo"><h3>From Endorsement:</h3>In a reversal of their number guessing game developed in Unit 2, students design an algorithm and program the computer so that the computer can guess the player's secret number, and the player tells the computer if its guesses are too high or too low. They use this as a basis for developing and analyzing list-search algorithms for ordered and unordered lists.</div>

                <p>PG: I also like Dan's card sorting activity. I have not explicitly touched either in the purpose statement, but they fit with that purpose: generating an algorithm and thinking about its efficiency.</p>

        <h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
			The 2 lab pages could be split across 2 to 3 days (90-140 minutes). Expected times to complete follow:
			<ul>
				<li>40-50 minutes (1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/1-sorted-lists.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Searching a Sorted List</a></li>
				<li>50-90 minutes (2 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/2-improving-search.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Analyzing and Improving Searches</a></li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><em><strong>Start with this off-computer game:</strong></em> 
                           <p><strong>Materials for each group:</strong> 15 paper cups numbered 1 through 15, 25 small cards (1/4 of a 3&times;5 card is a perfect size) numbered from 1 through 25.</p>
                           <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Two teams play. 
              				 <ul>
                 			    <li> Students in Team 1 arrange the cups in numerical order. Inside each cup, they place exactly one card. Cards must be placed <em>in numerical order</em>, but cards may be skipped. For example, the cups might contain, in order 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 16, .... Team 2 must not know what numbers have been placed.</li>
                                <li>A student in Team 2 uses <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/pick-random(1)to(25).png" alt="pick-random(1)to(25)"> to select a number at random and tells Team 1. </li>
                             </ul></p>
                           <p><strong>Play: </strong>
             				 <ul>
                 				<li>Then  Team 2 asks Team 1 &quot;is it in cup number __?&quot;</li>
                 				<li>Team 1 must answer &quot;yes&quot; if it is. Otherwise, Team 1 says &quot;the number in this cup is bigger than yours&quot; or  &quot;the number in this cup is bigger than yours.&quot; </li>
                 				<li>Team 2 asks a new question &quot;is it in cup number __?&quot; and the two teams continue until either the number is found or Team 2 concludes that the number isn't in any cup.</li>
              				</ul>
            			  </p>
                          <p><strong>Questions to keep in mind during play:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>What strategies can help you find a particular number with the fewest location checks?</li>
                                <li>On average, how many guesses would it take  to find a number?</li>
                                <li>How many guesses would it take to determine that a number didn't exist in the list at all?</li>
                                <li>How much more work would it be to find a number if the number of cups were doubled?</li>
                            </ul>
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Discussion after game: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Have students share some of their thinking about the four questions above: strategies, number of guesses to find a number, number of guesses to determine if a number <em>isn't</em> in the list, amount of additional work if the list length were doubled.</li>
                               
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Introduce programming activity by saying that the first part of the lab asks you to figure out a strategy for finding a number if the list is <em>not</em> sorted.</li>
                        <li>
                            Discussion: After students work through the lab page, you might ask these questions:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Which takes fewer computer steps? Finding a number in a sorted list or finding a number in an unsorted list?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Discussion: These questions are designed to inspire students to think about... :
                            <ul>
                            	<li></li>

        <h3>Assignments:</h3>
		<div>
        	<ul>
        		<li>
                	Students create a U5L1-GuessNumber project, which includes two new blocks:
                    <ul>
                    	<li><code>Number guessing game - player guesser</code> where the computer picks the number and tells the player if their guesses are too high or too low</li>
                    	<li><code>Number guessing game - computer guesser</code> where the player picks the number and tells the computer if its guesses are too high or too low</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Students also develop a U5L1-ListSearch project, a list searching algorithm that finds a specific number in an ordered list of numbers and reports its position.</li>
        	</ul>
