        <h2>Lab 1: Search Algorithms</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>Perhaps, at some point, the entire U2L3-GuessNumber activity should move here. We're  eager to shorten U2 and the game is not essential there. For now, we're writing as if GuessNumber <em>remains</em> in U2L3.</p>
            <p>PG: I also like Dan's card sorting activity. I have not explicitly touched either in the purpose statement, but they fit with that purpose: generating an algorithm and thinking about its efficiency.</p>
        </div>
        <p>In a reversal of their <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/4-abstraction/old/2-abstraction-developing-a-number-guessing-game.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 2 number guessing game</a>, students design an algorithm that identifies the player's secret number by: guessing, asking the player if the guesses are too high or too low, and guessing again until guessing right. Students use this as a basis for developing and analyzing list searching algorithms for ordered and unordered lists.</p>
		<p> An efficient list searching algorithm depends on the fact that numbers have order. Searching an <em>ordered</em> list to find the location of a given object is most efficiently done with essentially the same algorithm. Searching for the location of an object in an <em>unordered</em> list cannot be done the same way. The time that it takes these two algorithms to find their objects hardly matters when the lists are small, but matters a lot when the lists get large. This is students' first experience analyzing computational complexity.</p>

							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>

								<li>Implement an algorithm for searching <em>unsorted</em> lists.</li>

							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> After students work through the lab page, you might ask: "Which takes fewer computer steps, finding a number in a <em>sorted</em> list or finding a number in an <em>unsorted</em> list?"</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>Introduce programming activity by saying that the first part of the lab asks you to figure out a strategy for finding a number if the list is <em>not</em> sorted.</li>
                                <li>
                                    You might want to connect searching a sorted list with mean, median, midrange. In this list, 50 is the midrange, exactly midway between 1 and 99, but is a poor place to start the search because it doesn't split the list in half. The mean is approximately 34, which is no better. What we are looking for is the <em>median</em>, the number <em>in the middle of the sorted list</em>. Students may find it helpful to define blocks that find the <code>mean</code> and <code>median</code> of lists of numbers.<br />

                            <strong>Discussion:</strong> How is pseudocode useful?
                            <ul>
                                <li>What parallels are there between statements in pseudocode and blocks of Snap<em>!</em> code?</li>
                                <li>What ways can you outline your work before creating code?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								
                                <li>Students may have different impressions of the pseudocode steps as written. Encourage them to rewrite it in their own words. The concept here is to give students a clearer picture of ways they can organize their work somewhere in between a written language and their code.</li>
                                <li>In particular here, if a student misunderstands some of the pseudocode, get another student to help them with an alternate description. Or try to get the student to write something more useful to them. Ideally, don't show them the corresponding code, as this shortcuts the activity.</li>
                                <li>There are multiple ways to make the list of duplicates. Expect most students to build an algorithm similar to the one that determines if the unique list exists. If time permits and you see different algorithms used, highlight their differences. You can also use these algorithms in later labs as your examples for timing tests.</li>

            <h4>Essential Knowledge:</h4>
			<ul>
                <li><strong>EK 1.2.3A</strong> Creating computational artifacts can be done by combining and modifying existing artifacts or by creating new artifacts.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 1.2.3B</strong> Computation facilitates the creation and modification of computational artifacts with enhanced detail and precision.</li>
	            <li><strong>EK 3.2.1D</strong> Search tools are essential for efficiently finding information.</li>
				<li><strong>EK 4.1.2A</strong> Languages for algorithms include natural language, pseudocode, and visual and textual programming languages.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4B</strong> Empirical analysis of an algorithm is done by implementing the algorithm and running it on different inputs.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.1.2B</strong> Natural language and pseudocode describe algorithms so that humans can understand them.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4C</strong> The correctness of an algorithm is determined by reasoning formally or mathematically about the algorithm, not by testing an implementation of the algorithm.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4E</strong> Sometimes, more efficient algorithms are more complex.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4F</strong> Finding an efficient algorithm for a problem can help solve larger instances of the problem.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4H</strong> Linear search can be used when searching for an item in any list; binary search can be used only when the list is sorted.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.2.1A</strong> Algorithms are implemented using program instructions that are processed during program execution.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.2.1B</strong> Program instructions are executed sequentially.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.2.1C</strong> Program instructions may involve variables that are initialized and updated, read, and written.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.2.1D</strong> An understanding of instructions processing and program execution is useful for programming.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.2.1E</strong> Program execution automates processes.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.2.1F</strong> Processes use memory, a central processing unit (CPU), and input and output.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.2.1G</strong> A process may execute by itself or with other processes.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.2.1H</strong> A process may execute on one or several CPUs.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.2.1I</strong> Executable programs increase the scale of problems that can be addressed.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.2.1J</strong> Simple algorithms can solve a large set of problems when automated.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 5.2.1K</strong> Improvements in algorithms, hardware, and software increase the kinds of problems and the size of problems solvable by programming.</li>
