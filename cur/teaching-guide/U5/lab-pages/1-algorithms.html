        <h2>Lab 1: Search Algorithms</h2>
        <p>In a reversal of their <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/1-variables-games/3-debugging-extending.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Debugging and Extending Your Number Guessing Game">Unit 2 number guessing game</a>, students design an algorithm that identifies the player's secret number by: guessing, asking the player if the guesses are too high or too low, and guessing again until guessing right. Students use this as a basis for developing and analyzing list searching algorithms for ordered and unordered lists.</p>
		<p> An efficient list searching algorithm depends on the fact that numbers have order. Searching an <em>ordered</em> list to find the location of a given object is most efficiently done with essentially the same algorithm. Searching for the location of an object in an <em>unordered</em> list cannot be done the same way. The time that it takes these two algorithms to find their objects hardly matters when the lists are small, but matters a lot when the lists get large. This is students' first experience analyzing computational complexity.</p>

							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>

								<li>Implement an algorithm for searching <em>unsorted</em> lists.</li>
                                <li>Consider how the size of the search territory influences the amount of time that the search takes.</li>

                                <li>Implement an algorithm for searching <em>sorted</em> lists.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> After students work through the lab page, you might ask: "Which takes fewer computer steps, finding a number in a <em>sorted</em> list or finding a number in an <em>unsorted</em> list?"</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>Introduce programming activity by saying that the first part of the lab asks you to figure out a strategy for finding a number if the list is <em>not</em> sorted.</li>
                                <li>
                                    You might want to connect searching a sorted list with mean, median, midrange. In this list, 50 is the midrange, exactly midway between 1 and 99, but is a poor place to start the search because it doesn't split the list in half. The mean is approximately 34, which is no better. What we are looking for is the <em>median</em>, the number <em>in the middle of the sorted list</em>. Students may find it helpful to define blocks that find the <code>mean</code> and <code>median</code> of lists of numbers.<br />

                        <li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								
                                <li>Students may have different impressions of the pseudocode steps as written. Encourage them to rewrite it in their own words. The concept here is to give students a clearer picture of ways they can organize their work somewhere in between a written language and their code.</li>
                                <li>In particular here, if a student misunderstands some of the pseudocode, get another student to help them with an alternate description. Or try to get the student to write something more useful to them. Ideally, don't show them the corresponding code, as this shortcuts the activity.</li>
                                <li>There are multiple ways to make the list of duplicates. Expect most students to build an algorithm similar to the one that determines if the unique list exists. If time permits and you see different algorithms used, highlight their differences. You can also use these algorithms in later labs as your examples for timing tests.</li>

			<h4>Enduring Understandings:</h4>
            <p>Students implement and compare in various ways two different search algorithms (<strong>EU 4.1</strong>). This lab builds toward this EU by introducing the idea of analyzing the time requirement of an algorithm by counting operations. Students are required to develop a binary search algorithm in words and then program it.</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><strong>EU 4.1</strong> Algorithms are precise sequences of instructions for processes that can be executed by a computer and are implemented using programming languages.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
			<p>Students modify their Unit 2 number guessing game to make the computer guess the player's number (<strong>LO 1.2.3</strong>).</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>LO 1.2.3</strong> Create a new computational artifact by combining or modifying existing artifacts. [P2]</li>
			</ul>
            <h4>Essential Knowledge:</h4>
			<ul>
                <li><strong>EK 4.1.2A</strong> Languages for algorithms include natural language, pseudocode, and visual and textual programming languages.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.1.2B</strong> Natural language and pseudocode describe algorithms so that humans can understand them.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4E</strong> Sometimes, more efficient algorithms are more complex.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 4.2.4H</strong> Linear search can be used when searching for an item in any list; binary search can be used only when the list is sorted.</li>
