        <h2>Programming Lab 1: Algorithms</h2>
		<div class="todo">Perhaps, at some point, the entire U2L3-GuessNumber activity should move here. We're  eager to shorten U2 and the game is not essential there. For now, we're writing as if GuessNumber <em>remains</em> in U2L3.</div>
		<p>In  U2L3-GuessNumber, students built a Number Guessing game in which  the <em>computer</em> picks a number, the player tries to guess that number, and the computer tells the <em>player</em> if the guesses are too high or too low.</p>
		<p> In this lab, U5L1, students  design an algorithm and program the computer so that <em>it</em> can guess the player's secret number, and  the <em>player</em>  tells the <em>computer</em> if its guesses are too high or too low. An efficient algorithm depends on the fact that  numbers have order. Searching an ordered list to find the location of a given object is most efficiently done with essentially the same algorithm. Searching for the location of an object in an <em>unordered</em> list cannot be done the same way. The time that it takes these two algorithms to find their objects hardly matters when the lists are small, but matters a lot when the lists get large. This is students' first experience analyzing computational complexity.</p> 

		<div class="todo"><h3>From Endorsement:</h3>In a reversal of their number guessing game developed in Unit 2, students design an algorithm and program the computer so that the computer can guess the player's secret number, and the player tells the computer if its guesses are too high or too low. They use this as a basis for developing and analyzing list-search algorithms for ordered and unordered lists.</div>
        
        <div class="todo">
            <p>This was originally in the student pages, but Brian and I agree that it should be in the TG only. --MF</p>
            <p>PG: I also like Dan's card sorting activity. I have not explicitly touched either in the purpose statement, but they fit with that purpose: generating an algorithm and thinking about its efficiency.</p>

        <h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
            The 2 lab pages could be split across about 4 days (<strong>170-190 minutes</strong>). 
			  <ul>
				<li>60-70 minutes (one class period and part of a second) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/1-sorted-lists.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Searching a Sorted List</a></li>
				<li>20-30 minutes for off-computer game activity (<em>start</em> second day with this, then use remainder of period to complete first lab page)</li>
                <li>roughly 90 minutes (2 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/2-improving-search.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F5-algorithms.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Analyzing and Improving Searches</a></li>
			</ul>
</div>        
        
        
        <h3>Prepare:</h3>
		<div>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>For off-computer game (day 2 of lab page 1)</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Decide how to split your class into three groups, each with two teams. </li>
				<li>Prepare materials (15 cups and 25 small cards as described below) for each group. </li>
			</ul>
</div>


        <h3>Students will:</h3>

		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Invent and compare algorithms for searching sorted and unsorted lists.</li>

        <h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Page 1: Searching a Sorted List.</strong>
                    <ul>

                            Students begin directly with a programming lab. As you circulate, ask about students' strategies for guessing and their programming ideas.
                            <ul>
                                <li>If there is time, you may want to ask various students to share strategies.</li>
                                <li>If not, these issues will come up in subsequent periods.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Page 2: Analyzing and Improving Searches.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em><strong>Start with this off-computer game:</strong></em> 
                           <p><strong>Materials for each group:</strong> 15 paper cups numbered 1 through 15, 25 small cards (1/4 of a 3&times;5 card is a perfect size) numbered from 1 through 25.</p>
                           <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Two teams play. 
              				 <ul>
                 			    <li> Students in Team 1 arrange the cups in numerical order. Inside each cup, they place exactly one card, keeping the numbers and placement secret from Team 2. Cards may be skipped, but the ones that are used must be placed <em>in numerical order</em>. For example, the cups might contain, in order 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 16, 17....</li>
                                <li>A student in Team 2 selects a number at random, using <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/pick-random(1)to(25).png" alt="pick-random(1)to(25)">, and tells Team 1. </li>
                             </ul></p>
                           <p><strong>Goal: </strong> Team 2 tries to figure out, using the fewest questions, which cup that number is in, or determine that it has not been used (is not in any cup). Team 2 players may ask <em>only</em> &quot;Is it in cup number ____?&quot; Team 1 may answer <em>only</em> &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;the number in that cup is higher/lower than the number you are looking for.&quot;</p>
             			   <p><strong>Play: </strong>
             				 <ul>
                 				<li>Team 2 asks Team 1 &quot;is it in cup number __?&quot;</li>
                 				<li>Team 1 must answer &quot;yes&quot; if it is. Otherwise, Team 1 says &quot;the number in this cup is higher than the number you are looking for&quot; or  &quot;the number in this cup is lower than the number you are looking for.&quot; </li>
                 				<li>Team 2 asks a new question &quot;is it in cup number __?&quot; and the two teams continue until either the number is found or Team 2 concludes that the number isn't in any cup.</li>
              				</ul>
            			  </p>
                          <p><strong>Questions to keep in mind during play:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>What strategies can help you find a particular number with the fewest location checks?</li>
                                <li>On average, how many guesses would it take  to find a number?</li>
                                <li>How many guesses would it take to determine that a number didn't exist in the list at all?</li>
                                <li>How much more work would it be to find a number if the number of cups were doubled?</li>
                            </ul>
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Discussion after game: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Have students share some of their thinking about the four questions above: strategies, number of guesses to find a number, number of guesses to determine if a number <em>isn't</em> in the list, amount of additional work if the list length were doubled.</li>
                               
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Introduce programming activity by saying that the first part of the lab asks you to figure out a strategy for finding a number if the list is <em>not</em> sorted.</li>
                        <li>
                            Discussion: After students work through the lab page, you might ask these questions:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Which takes fewer computer steps: finding a number in a sorted list or finding a number in an unsorted list?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
</div>

		<div>
        	<ul>
        		<li>
                	Students create a U5L1-GuessNumber project, which includes two new blocks:
                    <ul>
                    	<li><code>Number guessing game - player guesser</code> where the computer picks the number and tells the player if their guesses are too high or too low</li>
                    	<li><code>Number guessing game - computer guesser</code> where the player picks the number and tells the computer if its guesses are too high or too low</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Students also develop a U5L1-ListSearch project, a list searching algorithm that finds a specific number in an ordered list of numbers and reports its position.</li>

In this list, 50 is the midrange, exactly midway between 1 and 99, but is a poor place to start the search because it doesn't split the list in half. The mean is approximately 34, which is no better. What we are looking for is the median, the number <em>in the middle of the sorted list</em>. Some students may want to define blocks that find the mean <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/mean(awful-list)-withResult.png" alt="mean(awful-list)-withResult"> and median <img src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/median(awful-list)-withResult.png" alt="median(awful-list)-withResult"> of lists of numbers.</li>
