		<h2>Hybrid and Remote Teaching Tips</h2>
		<p>BJC is a free, online curriculum, with a free, online programming language, <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/run" title="Snap!" target="_blank">Snap<em>!</em></a>, and it is designed to be used in student pairs with minimal teacher presentation. This makes BJC ideal for the shift to hybrid or remote teaching format.</p> 
		
        <p>
			Nevertheless, the transition to online learning can be a challenge. Below is a collection of suggestions from BJC curriculum designers and experienced BJC teachers to help teachers teaching BJC remotely:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Continue leading BJC as before.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As with in-person teaching of BJC, the bulk of class time should be spent on student-led pair-programming. Instead of walking around the room and looking over studentsâ€™ shoulders, use meeting software screen sharing to drop-in on break-out rooms.</li>
                        <li>BJC always encourages student discussion and collaboration over lecture. Continue this practice online. Any teacher-led explanations belong after students have engaged with the content.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Set virtual class expectations</strong> such as: arriving on time in a quiet location ready to learn, participating, muting while not speaking, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Offer consistent and organized online resources and interaction portals</strong>. Students should always know where to find necessary documents, links, and due dates and where to submit assignments.</li>
                <li><strong>Encourage each new group of students to get to know each other</strong> through meaningful connection activities such as small-group social implications discussions.</li>
                <li><strong>Take advantage of the <a href="https://piazza.com/class/h8yx482idav52y" title="BJC Teacher Community on Piazza" target="_blank">BJC Teacher Community on Piazza</a></strong> (visit <a href="https://teachers.bjc.berkeley.edu" title="teachers.bjc.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">teachers.bjc.berkeley.edu</a> for initial access) where you can solicit support from experienced BJC teachers as well as the designers of BJC and Snap<em>!</em>.</li>
                <li><strong>Join a <a href="https://piazza.com/class/h8yx482idav52y?cid=3355" title="BJC Small Group" target="_blank">BJC Small Group</a></strong> &mdash;a virtual Professional Learning Community of BJC teachers.</li>
                <li><strong>Make use of the online formative assessments in <a href="https://myap.collegeboard.org/login" title="AP Classroom" target="_blank">AP Classroom</a></strong> released in 2020. The BJC Teaching Guide unit overview pages indicate which AP Classroom Topics have been completely covered by end of each unit of BJC.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Identify a minimal set of online tools</strong> that will work best for you and your students. (Test tools on your own or with colleagues; avoid introducing too many tools.)<br />
