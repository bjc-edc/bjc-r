		<h2>Lab 2: Recursion Projects</h2>
		<p>In this lab, students explore more variety in fractal shape generation and practice writing recursive definitions (like <code>tree</code> in Lab 1) right away without first constructing non-recursive versions (e.g. <code>tree 1</code>, <code>tree 2</code>, <code>tree 3</code>, etc.) of their programs. Students explore several common fractal structures,  see how fractal structures occur in the natural world, and then use recursion to <em>model</em> the artwork of Mondrian.</p>

			<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Students work with recursive <em>commands</em> in this unit; they will program recursive <em>reporters</em> in Unit 8.</li>

		<h3>Pacing</h3>
		<div>
			The 3 required lab pages could be split across 3&ndash;5 days (<strong>95&ndash;190 minutes</strong>). Expected times to complete follow:
			<ul>
                <li>25&ndash;50 minutes (&lt;1 day) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/7-recursion/2-projects/1-triangle-fractal.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F7-recursion-trees-fractals.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Triangle Fractal">Triangle Fractal</a></li>
                <li>20&ndash;40 minutes (&lt;1 day) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/7-recursion/2-projects/2-snowflake.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F7-recursion-trees-fractals.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Koch Snowflake">Koch Snowflake</a></li>
                <li>If used, 20&ndash;40 minutes (&lt;1 day) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/7-recursion/2-projects/3-c-curve.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F7-recursion-trees-fractals.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Lévy C-Curve Fractal">Lévy C-Curve Fractal</a>*</li>
                <li>50&ndash;100 minutes (1&ndash;2 days) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/7-recursion/2-projects/4-mondrian.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F7-recursion-trees-fractals.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Recursive Mondrian">Recursive Mondrian</a></li>

		<h3>Prepare</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>You may find it helpful to try a few of the lab pages yourself before presenting them to students&mdash;perhaps one of the fractals (Triangle Fractal, Koch Snowflake, or Lévy C-Curve) and the Recursive Mondrian page.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

					<strong>Page 1: Triangle Fractal.</strong>

                        	<ul>
                            	<li>This optional debugging activity is similar to one that students saw in Unit 1 with a pentagon. The purpose is to highlight the difference between the interior angle of a polygon and the turning angle that a sprite must move through in order to create each angle of the shape. Use as needed with your students. Additional details on clarifying this idea are included in the "Tips" section below.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
						<li><strong>Tip:</strong> You may need to remind students of the difference between an interior angle (like the angles they learn about in math class) and an angle of sprite rotation (exterior angle). Students associate the angles of a equilateral triangle are 60&deg; but, to draw a triangle with a sprite, they need to think how the sprite turns. After drawing each side, note the direction the sprite  is facing; it must turn 120&deg; in order to draw the next side. Demonstrating this to students by using a physical object (e.g., a pencil) to represent the sprite as it moves may help.</li>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Learning Goal:</strong> Practice recursion by developing several fractal-drawing programs.</li>
						<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Discuss the last "For You To Do" question as a class: Why does the size in each recursive call have to be one third the size of the previous level? There are four copies; why not one fourth the size?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Page 3: Lévy C-Curve Fractal.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Learning Goal:</strong> Apply mathematics (including Pythagorean formula, coordinate positioning, and angles) to computer graphics.</li>
						<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> After students have had time to explore them on their own, you may want the class to discuss the first two questions (about the <var>size</var> input for the recursive calls and about how the turning angles combine to create a 180&deg; angle).</li>
                        <li>
                        	<strong>Tip:</strong> Students may require some support around the use of the Pythagorean formula on this page, but it is not beyond an introductory algebra student. Since <var>size</var> is the length of the long side of an isosceles right triangle, the size of the smaller sides can be found in this way:<br />
                        	<span class="katex-block">smaller^2 + smaller^2 = size^2</span>
                        	<span class="katex-block">2 \times smaller^2 = size^2</span>
                            <span class="katex-block">smaller^2 = \frac{size^2}{2}</span>
                            <span class="katex-block">smaller = \sqrt{\frac{size^2}{2}}</span>
                            <span class="katex-block">smaller = \frac{size}{\sqrt{2}}</span>
                        </li>

                            	<li>The script presented asks students to take a careful look at a bug with coordinate positioning and state transparency. Instead of undoing the moves done by <code>rectangle</code>, the buggy script attempts to return the sprite by placing it at <span class="katex">(\frac{width}{2},\frac{height}{2})</span>. This <em>would</em> work for the base case as it is centered around the origin. However, the rectangles in <code>Mondrian</code> are generally <em>not</em> centered around the origin, and so the script does not produce the intended image.</li>

                                <li>This page is quite a bit harder than most previous work, in part because we deliberately refrained from extensive scaffolding.  It may take your class longer than most pages and they may leave the first class session with their code still not working.</li>
