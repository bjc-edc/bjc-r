		<h2>Lab 2: Recursion Projects</h2>
		<p>In this lab, students explore more variety in fractal shape generation and practice writing recursive definitions (like <code>tree</code> in Lab 1) right away without first constructing non-recursive versions (e.g. <code>tree 1</code>, <code>tree 2</code>, <code>tree 3</code>, etc.) of their programs. Students explore several common fractal structures,  see how fractal structures occur in the natural world, and then use recursion to <em>model</em> the artwork of Mondrian.</p>

		<h3>Prepare:</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>You may find it helpful to try a few of the lab pages yourself before presenting them to students&mdash;perhaps one of the fractals (Triangle Fractal, Koch Snowflake, or Lévy C-Curve) and the Recursive Mondrian page.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<h3>Students will:</h3>
		<div class="sidenoteBig">
			<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Students work with recursive <em>commands</em> in this unit; they will program recursive <em>reporters</em> in Unit 8.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Practice recursion by developing several fractal-drawing programs.</li>
                <li>Apply mathematics (including Pythagorean formula, coordinate positioning, and angles) to computer graphics.</li>
				<li>Explore fractals in nature and perhaps also attempt to create a fractal that mimics nature in some way.</li>
				<li>Use recursion to create Mondrian-style pictures.</li>
			</ul>

                        	<ul>
                            	<li>This optional debugging activity is  similar to one that students saw in Unit 1 with a pentagon. The purpose is to highlight the difference between the interior angle of a polygon and the turning angle that a sprite must move through in order to create each angle of the shape. Use as needed with your students. Additional details on clarifying this idea are included in the "Tips" section below.</li>
                            </ul>

					<ul>
						<li>Discuss the last "For You To Do" question as a class: Why does the size in each recursive call have to be one third the size of the previous level? There are four copies; why not one fourth the size?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Page 3: Lévy C-Curve Fractal.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Discussion: After students have had time to explore them on their own, you may want the class to discuss the first two questions (about the <var>size</var> input for the recursive calls and about how the turning angles combine to create a 180&deg; angle).</li>
					</ul>

					<strong>Page 4: Fractals in Nature.</strong>
					<ul>  <div class="comment">PG: had said "can create." In fact, creating clouds and coastlines is really not an immediately obvious task, even for students who are moving quickly.</div>
						<li>This lab page is just a web search for images of fractals in nature. Students who are moving more quickly through the lab can think about how to create a fractal structure of their own based on nature.</li>

                        	Debugging: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OWQFlia-OpksfGih-cgXfvDRiub4JUT2QZ4xs5djWvQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Mondrian Base Case</a>
                        	<ul>
                            	<li>The script presented asks students to take a careful look at a bug with coordinate positioning and state transparency. Instead of undoing the moves done by <code>rectangle</code>, the buggy script attempts to return the sprite by placing it at <span class="katex">(\frac{width}{2},\frac{height}{2})</span>. This <em>would</em> work for the base case as it is centered around the origin. However, the rectangles in <code>Mondrian</code> are generally <em>not</em> centered around the origin, and so the script does not produce the intended image.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
						<li>
                        	Sorting out the correct inputs for all of the missing slots in the recursive script requires thought. You may want to talk some things through as a class after students have had a chance to try it on their own for a bit.<br />
                    		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/mondrian-block-definition-with-blanks.png" alt="Mondrian block definition with blanks" title="Mondrian block definition with blanks" />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Encourage students to work on the empty blocks in <code>Mondrian</code> one at a time. For example, students can completely ignore what happens when <var>height</var> &gt; <var>width</var> by setting the input <var>level</var> for the initial call to <code>Mondrian</code> to 2 and just focusing on getting level 2 to work first. In fact, they can even focus just on the very first recursive call within <code>Mondrian</code> and getting the right-most level 2 rectangle working first, like this image below: <br />

                            After getting level 2 to work correctly, they can follow a similar block-by-block process with level 3: getting the upper-right-most level 3 rectangle working with the first recursive call to <code>Mondrian</code> within the <code>else</code> case of the <code>if-else block</code>:<br />

		<h3>Tips:</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Page 1: Triangle Fractal.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>You may need to remind students of the difference between an interior angle (like the angles they learn about in math class) and an angle of sprite rotation (exterior angle). Students associate the angles of a equilateral triangle are 60&deg; but, to draw a triangle with a sprite, they need to think how the sprite turns. After drawing each side, note the direction the sprite  is facing; it must turn 120&deg; in order to draw the next side. Demonstrating this to students by using a physical object (e.g., a pencil) to represent the sprite as it moves may help.</li>

						<li>
                        	Students may require some support around the use of the Pythagorean formula on this page, but it is not beyond an introductory algebra student. Since <var>size</var> is the length of the long side of an isosceles right triangle, the size of the smaller sides can be found in this way:<br />
                        	<span class="katex-block">smaller^2 + smaller^2 = size^2</span>
                        	<span class="katex-block">2 \times smaller^2 = size^2</span>
                            <span class="katex-block">smaller^2 = \frac{size^2}{2}</span>
                            <span class="katex-block">smaller = \sqrt{\frac{size^2}{2}}</span>
                            <span class="katex-block">smaller = \frac{size}{\sqrt{2}}</span>
                            
                        </li>

						<li>We opted to provide much of the structure of this program, but it's still a complex project to consider. If possible, encourage students to at least <em>read</em> the list of considerations for the recursive <code>Mondrian</code> block before the end of the first class period on this lab. You may also want to read the list as a class at the beginning of the second day on this lab and have students indicate where these ideas appear in the script and share their thoughts or observations with the class.</li>
