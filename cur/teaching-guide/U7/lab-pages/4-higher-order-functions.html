		<h2>Programming Lab 4: Higher-Order Functions</h2>
		<p>We end the unit by what will seem like a step backwards, to relatively simple linear recursions. But this important lab has a hidden agenda: The simple examples can be generalized into the higher order functions of Unit 3. For students who've made it through the rest of Unit 7, this lab won't seem hard at all, but implementing higher order functions is a big idea that students can accomplish. The visual metaphors of Snap<em>!</em> enable this simple treatment.</p>

		<h3>Tips:</h3>
		<div>
            <ul>
            	<li>
                	<strong>Page 1: Plurals and Other Recursions.</strong>
                    <ul>
						<li>Students may have a hard time playing along with the concept, so emphasize that you're focusing on a pattern of code.</li>
						<li>If time permits, work with some more examples like <code>squares</code> as a full-class discussion. Try one or more of these examples, then ask the students for their ideas:
						<ul>
						<li>subtract 1 from each element of a list</li>
						<li>round each element of a list to the nearest integer</li>
						<li>converting Unicode numbers to letters</li>
                    </ul>
					Doing this may help students realize that the <code>plurals</code> code pattern is the same one that <code>map</code> uses.
					<li>The <code>exaggerate</code> block has a wide berth of options for students. Start by having students code the number-replacement piece, then let them work on whatever they want. If discussing this, the key is that the exaggerate helper function is called on each word, and the pattern recursively moves across the list of words. Note that since this pattern works on <em>lists</em>, the entire sentence must be converted to a list at the start, then converted <em>back</em> to a sentence at the end.</li>
					</ul>
                </li>
            	<li>
                	<strong>Page 2: Generalizing the Map Pattern.</strong>
                    <ul>
						<li>Emphasize the similarity between the three pieces of code on the page, and what a generalization of that pattern might look like. At that point, students understand what <code>map</code> does, it is just a flexible version of the code pattern used by <code>plurals</code>.</li>
						<li>The details of marking the input as a function and using the <code>call</code> block are worth going through, but ultimately the activity is about how <code>map</code> isn't very complicated. It's a generalization of the pattern used by a simple recursive reporter. If students get bogged by those details they may miss this important point.</li>
						<li>Consider building <code>pairup</code> two ways; one way using <code>map</code>, and one way in the style of <code>plurals</code> with a helper function. Students may see through this work that the helper function is one input to <code>map</code>.</li>
						<li>Interested groups may want to dig into the code of the internal <code>map</code> block, which is not much different than what is built here. Most of the additional code for the internal <code>map</code> block handles multiple lists as input to a single call, in order to process functions with multiple inputs. The <strong>mapone</strong> area of the block is the place to focus.</li>
                    </ul>
                <//li>
            	<li>
                	<strong>Page 3: Even Numbers and Filtering.</strong>
                    <ul>
						<li>The page begins with recursive code for the <code>evens</code> block. If there is time, start by asking students to build this block, rather than reading the code written here.</li>
						<li>Emphasize the similarity between <code>evens</code>, <code>ends-e</code>, and <code>numbers</code>, and what a generalization of that pattern might look like. At that point, students understand what <code>keep</code> does, it is just a flexible version of the code pattern used by <code>evens</code>.</li>
						<li>Students may have difficulty constructing <code>keep</code>, since the details of building its inputs are unusual. Similar to <code>map</code>, an input type must be declared, but this time it is a <strong>predicate</strong> and not a reporter.</li>
						<li>The work on <code>combine</code> and <code>sort</code> also allow for further opportunities to use the process that built <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code>. Emphasize to students the types involved, to help them decide when the gray-box input should be a reporter and when it should be a predicate.</li>
						<li>If there is time, definitely dig into the code of the internal <code>keep</code> block. Its code is almost identical to the generalization of <code>evens</code>. Expect students' code for <code>combine</code> to also be very similar to the code of the internal block.</li>
