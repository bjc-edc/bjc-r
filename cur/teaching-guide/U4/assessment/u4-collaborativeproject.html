		<title>Unit 4 Assessment: Collaborative Class Project</title>
	</head>

<body>
<p>The Internet is vast and ever-evolving, so it is not an easy task to cover it in a single unit.  A possible approach is a divide-and-conquer class project. Each student, perhaps with a partner, will prepare a 5-minute presentation on a particular topic of interest, drawn from the AP CSP standards.  Students are expected to research the topic thoroughly and use creative means (posters, Snap! animations, video clips etc.) to bring the topic to life.  Collaboration and sharing of resources are encouraged. All students must be prepared with all of the material, so the culmination of the project is a class presentation of all the topics and some more permanent product (a website, pamphlet, video gallery) that gives everyone access to the classâ€™s collective knowledge, supporting their preparation for the AP CSP test.</p>

<p>In classes with few students, each student might take on multiple related topics, with more time allocated to the development and presentation.   In classes with many students, partnerships and group work can help.  As the students may not know ahead of time which topics are important and also interesting for them, you may want everyone to do some basic research on all of the topics first (such as reviewing the BJC Internet materials online) and submit some topic choices in order of interest.  You can then assign topics making sure that the span covers most of the AP CSP requirements.</p>
