                <li>Exercise 1: With 2 bits there are only 2<sup>2</sup> = 2 &times; 2 = 4 possibilities {00,01,10,11}.</li>
                <li>Exercise 2: With 3 bits there are only 2<sup>3</sup> = 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 = 8 possibilities {000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111}.</li>
                <li>Exercise 3: With 4 bits there are only 2<sup>4</sup> = 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 = 16 possibilities {0000, 0001, ...., 1111}.</li>
                <li>Exercise 4: 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024 to be exact.</li>
                <li>Exercise 5: There are 7 days of the week and the closest power of 2 past 7 is 8 which is 2<sup>3</sup>.  Thus, 3 bits are enough.</li>
                <li>Exercise 6: There are 10 decimal digits {0, 1, 2, ...,9} and the closest power of 2 past 10 is 16 which is 2<sup>4</sup>.  Thus, 4 bits are enough.</li>
                <li>Exercise 7: If we use a calculator like Wolfram Alpha we get 2<sup>64</sup> = 18446744073709551616 = 1.8446744073709551616 &times; 10<sup>19</sup> many values.  The approximation trick can be used 2<sup>10</sup> &asymp; 1000. So 2<sup>64</sup> = 2<sup>4</sup> &times; 2<sup>60</sup> = 16 &times; (2<sup>10</sup>)<sup>6</sup> &asymp; 16 &times; (1000)<sup>6</sup> = 1.6 &times; 10<sup>19</sup> which is close to the actual number given above.</li>
                <li>Exercise 8: There are 26 letters {A, B, C, ..., Z} and 10 digits {0, 1, ..., 9} so 26 + 10 = 36 in total.  The closest power of 2 past 36 is 64 which is 2<sup>6</sup>.  Thus, 6 bits are enough.</li>
                <li>Exercise 9:  Unicode has 136,755 characters, so 18 bits are needed as the closest power of 2 past this number is 2<sup>18</sup> = 266,144 &gt; 136,755 but 2<sup>17</sup> = 131,072 &lt; 136,755.</li>

            <strong>Take It Further:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Exercise A: "One significant digit" means that, for example, 200 is representable, but 210 isn't. Here are <em>all</em> the representable values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>0</li>
                            <li>0.01, 0.02, ... 0.09</li>
                            <li>0.1, 0.2, ... 0.9</li>
                            <li>1, 2, ... 9</li>
                            <li>10, 20, ... 90</li>
                            <li>100, 200, ... 900</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So there are exactly 46 representable values. Here they are, on the number line:<br />
                        <img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/floats.png" width="1200" alt="number line with floating point values plotted" title="number line with floating point values plotted"><br />
                        It's easy to see the multiples of 10 and of 100, but all the smaller values are a blur.  If you could zoom in on the range from 0 to 10, it would look the same, with the multiples of 0.1 and 1 visible, and the multiples of 0.01 just a blur.</p>
                    <p>What are the pros and cons of this representation?  Only 28 integer values can be represented, so 972 integers less than 1000 <em>can't</em> be.  This seems like a severe weakness, but remember, the rules of this game say that you only have enough room in your representation for 46 values altogether. You could choose multiples of 20, to get all your values evenly spaced, but then you get no fractions at all.  This system gives you a few really small values, a few medium-sized values, and a few really big values.  So physicists can measure the size of an electron, astronomers can measure the size of the galaxy, and the rest of us can budget our money.</p>
                    <p>By the way, if you want to make this picture in Snap<em>!</em>, you need a widescreen monitor, and then you can click on the gear (settings) menu, choose "stage size," and set the horizontal size to 1200 so there's some margin around your number line.</p>

                <li>Exercise 6: The hex RGB codes requires less space. The color names are easier to understand. The two are easy to use in different ways: the RGB code is precise and doesn't depend on human interpretation, but the color names may be more familiar.</li>
                <li>Exercise 7: Human beings use decimal because we have ten fingers, and computers use decimal when they are interacting with human beings. When they're <em>not</em> interacting with people, computers use binary because transistors have two stable states. Neither people nor computers really speak hex, but when people are forced to deal with binary, we use hex as an abbreviation (one fourth the length of the binary numeral), and so computers use hex to convey binary to humans. RGB color codes are just one instance of that.</li>
                <li>Exercise 8: In all of these contexts, abstraction is used to hide complexity and to simplify things.  Hexadecimal representation abbreviates binary representation and makes it more readable, just as custom blocks and ADTs simplify complex code and make the code more readable.</li>
