		<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/current-temp-34.png" alt="current temperature in (New York) reporting 34" title="current temperature in (New York) reporting 34" />
				<p>In this lab, students build a weather app, starting from their work <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-web-data/4-scraping.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">scraping data from web pages in Lab 1</a>. They will scrape a weather website for information, importing HTML to Snap<em>!</em>. They will produce a multi-city weather report, and use IP address information to determine information about current local conditions.</p>

		<h3>Tips:</h3>

        	<ul>
        		<li>
                	<strong>Page 1: Reading Data Using URL Tags.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is more than one correct way to complete the URL tag for Google. Many students will find <code>http://www.google.com/search?q=snap</code> instead of the version listed on the page. Both are acceptable and either can be used to complete the task here.</li>
						<li>Be sure to discuss the use of pluses in multi-word searches such as <strong>new+york</strong>. This will be useful throughout the lab. It may also be useful to point out that this notation isn't universal, and that the use and notation for URL tags may change for other sites.</li>
						<li>Students shouldn't have much trouble finding the Snap<em>!</em> blocks to build the URL for this task. They may need a reminder about what directories to look in, and may need a reminder about the proper use of the <code>proxied http</code> block.</li>
                    </ul>
            	</li>
        		<li>
                	<strong>Page 2: Pulling Weather Data.</strong>
                    <ul>
							<li>Up front, check to see that the <code>substring</code> blocks are available in students' working projects. If they continue from the project started on the previous page, these blocks will already be loaded. The <code>substring</code> blocks are necessary for the work of extracting the current temperature and conditions from longer lines of text. Students may need some help and reminders about how these blocks behave, notably that there are two different blocks for the beginning and end of strings.</li>
                        <li>Watch for students making errors in building the URL tags for Weatherstreet. Specifically, state names must be listed, and without a space: <strong>Boston,MA</strong> and not <strong>Boston, MA</strong> or <strong>Boston</strong>. Multi-word city names must use a plus, not a space, between names: <strong>New+York,NY</strong> not <strong>New York,NY</strong>. In general, if this remains a difficult issue, you can ask students to enter ZIP codes instead of city names. This simplification applies throughout the rest of this lab.</li>
						<li>Students may have a difficult time figuring out how to extract the useful lines from Weatherstreet. Let them know that the relevant lines have unique identifiers in the HTML source. If students still have trouble, show them the lines: the current temperature line has the identifier <code>currenttemp</code>, and the current condition has the identifier <code>currentwx2</code>.</li>
						<li>There is more than one way, but in order to uniquely find these lines within the HTML source, consider having students return only the body of HTML and ignore the head; this was done previously in Lab 1. Alternately, they can choose the specific useful line after a <code>keep</code> operation.</li>
                    </ul>
            	</li>

                	<strong>Page 3: Building A Weather Report.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If students choose to allow "cleaner" city entries like <strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong> they will need to process this using either <code>substring</code> or the blocks that convert between words and lists. This step may prove to be very difficult for some. If time is tight, consider dropping this option and have students use formatted entries like <strong>Los+Angeles,CA</strong> or ZIP codes.</li>
						<li>Watch for students avoiding list operations in both the gathering and communicating of information. A single <code>map</code> operation can be used to do each. In particular, students often forget they can include the original information as part of the result of <code>map</code>, then have trouble linking their data to the original.</li>
						<li>Students working on the Take It Further will need to find ways in the HTML source to extract the additional information. If doing so, encourage them to create blocks, so they can continue this work during the follow-up activity.</li>
                    </ul>
            	</li>
        		<li>
                	<strong>Page 4: Need An Umbrella?</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students should already have familiarity building the <code>my IP address</code> block from Lab 4. They may need to import this block to their weather app project. If that block was not built in Lab 4, they can use <code>ipinfo.io</code> to determine their IP.</li>
						<li>It may be unclear to students how to quickly get the city and state from the IP address. While it is possible to use the HTML source from the main page of <code>ipinfo.io</code>, it is much more efficient to use the direct page links to city and state.</li>
						<li>Students may have difficulty here compiling the city and state information into the formatted text required by Weatherstreet, particularly for multi-word city names. Give students an opportunity to try it, but if it proves too difficult, have them use the <code>ipinfo.io/xx.xx.xx.xx/postal</code> option to retrieve the ZIP code for their current location, then use the ZIP code as the URL tag for Weatherstreet.</li>
						<li>Remind students there are multiple possible weather conditions that might cause the <code>umbrella</code> block to report true, including <strong>drizzle</strong> and <strong>heavy rain</strong>. This is a spot for some creativity, especially if students want to build a reporter instead of a predicate.</li>
