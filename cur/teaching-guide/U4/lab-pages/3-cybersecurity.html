			<ul>
				<li>As you do <a href="http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" target="_blank">Computing in the News </a> with your students this week, look for news stories relating to issues of encryption. Highlight stories that might give students ideas for their research task at the end of the lab about innovations that need to transmit data securely.</li>
<li>Students will read parts of <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=179" target="_blank">Chapter 5 of Blown to Bits</a>. Reading through the entire chapter will be helpful, especially to get a better understanding of the evolution of encryption methods and some details of public key encryption.</li>

            <p>About one year ago, a bug of incredible magnitude was uncovered.  It was an incredibly serious security hole (aka vulnerability) in OpenSSL, which provides security and privacy for the Internet (web, email, IM, VPNs, etc).  </p>

                                <li>Catch a glimpse into what public key encryption is and how it differs from private key encryption. (It is not necessary for students to understand the mathematics involved.)</li>

                        <strong>Tips:</strong>
                        	<ul>
                            <li>Most students will greatly enjoy encoding and decoding secret messages.  Make sure that there is enough time planned in the lesson for this hands-on activity.</li>
                            <li>It may be a good idea to suggest that for starters students try to encode/decode very short messages.</li>
                            <li>Some students may get frustrated in the decoding process, not being able to crack their partners code, even for short messages.  Tell them that the challenging nature of decoding is to be expected and is actually one of the main take aways of this activity.</li>

                        <li>Understand how Caesar and substitution ciphers work.</li>
                        <li>Understand the difference between a Caesar Cipher and a substitution cipher. </li>

                        <strong>Tips:</strong>
                        	<ul>
                            <li>Some students may find the ciphers discussed here too abstract.  Let them encode/decode a simple message using the example ciphers given to gain some hands-on experience.</li>
                            <li>Take some time to discuss the weaknesses of these ciphers and how they may be broken.  Invite suggestions on how to improve on the security of such systems of cryptography.</li>

                        <strong>Tips:</strong>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Some students may have difficulty understanding the Unicode system.  Encourage them to study the chart given which shows how each character have an associated Unicode number.</li>
                        <li>From the earlier page on symmetric cryptography, some students will be expecting that the Caesar cipher will wrap letters around the alphabet when shifting.  Explain to them that the mathematics of emulating such wrapping is non-trivial and we will be implementing a simpler version of the Caesar cipher that does not involve any wrapping.
