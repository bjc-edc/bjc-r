		<h3>Prepare:</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>As you do <a href="http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" target="_blank">Computing in the News </a> with your students this week, look for news stories relating to issues of encryption. Highlight stories that might give students ideas for their research task at the end of the lab about innovations that need to transmit data securely.</li>
<li>Students will read parts of <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=179" target="_blank">Chapter 5 of Blown to Bits</a>. Reading through the entire chapter will be helpful, especially to get a better understanding of the evolution of encryption methods and some details of public key encryption.</li>

            <h3>Heartbleed Bug!</h3>
            <p>About one year ago, a bug of incredible magnitude was uncovered.  It was an incredibly serious security hole (aka vulnerability) in OpenSSL, which provides security and privacy for the Internet (web, email, IM, VPNs, etc).  </p>
