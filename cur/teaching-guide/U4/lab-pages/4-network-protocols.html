		<h2>Programming Lab 4: Network Protocols</h2>
		<p>This lab is central to students' understanding of the abstractions that make the Internet work (especially TCP/IP). </p>
		<p>The first three pages cover the Internet protocol suite including IP Address Hierarchy, IPv4 vs. IPv6, packets and packet switching, reliable data transmission, open standards, and the Internet abstraction hierarchy. Students identify the IP address of the computer they are using by using Snap<em>!</em> to scrape the results of a "my ip address" query to a Server engine to make a <code>my IP address</code> block.</p>
		<p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)&mdash;and the Internet Society that oversees the IETF&mdash;oversee the Internet protocols, and the US Department of Commerce controls the DNS hierarchy (the domain namespace and the allocation of IP addresses). On the last page of this lab, Who's In Charge of the Internet?, students learn about the history and impact of these organizations controlling the communication standards and addressing systems for the Internet.</p>

        <div class="todo">Again, I question the idea of putting particular CitN topics here.  Especially it's risky saying "recently" about events that will be long past when people are still using this curriculum in the year 2287.--bh</div>

	<h3>Tips:</h3>
		<div>
            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Page 1: The Network of Networks: IP.</strong>
            	  <ul>
            	    <li>This page just skims the surface of IP. An end-user computer typically has just three cases to consider:
            	      <ul>
            	        <li>Is this <em>my own</em> IP address? If so, don't use the network at all; send the message by software to another process on this same computer.</li>
            	        <li>If not, is this another computer on my local net? If so, use the appropriate link layer protocol to tell my network hardware to send the message directly to that other computer.</li>
            	        <li>Otherwise, send the message to my router, which is typically computer number 1 on my local net.</li>
           	          </ul>
           	        But routers at ISPs have a hugely complicated job.  Because of redundant hardware connections, they can't just look up &quot;the&quot; route to the desired computer.  They have to consider alternate routes, check on how long it's taken to get messages across the net using each route recently, and pick the best one.  Also, it used to be that routers could be pretty confident about heuristics such as &quot;if the address starts with 128 it's in the USA,&quot; but the advent of <em>virtual private networks</em> means that my laptop can pretend to be on the Berkekey campus when it's actually physically in Korea. Luckily none of this is on the AP syllabus, and we have judged that trying to give students a deeper understanding of TCP (page 3) is more important than diving deeper into IP.</li>
           	      </ul>
            	</li>
            	<li>
                	<strong>Page 2: Reliable Transmission on Unreliable Networks: TCP.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The project included in this page simulates unreliable packet transmission using IP for students to consider how they might address the unreliability. More advanced students can attempt to develop their own version of TCP in the Take It Further section at the bottom of the page. That's a very challenging programming project, perhaps the hardest in the course. But even students who are not completely successful at it will gain a deeper appreciation of the importance of TCP.</li>
                        <li>In the TCP project, students are asked to solve two problems:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Packets may arrive out of order. (Solution: serial numbers in the packet headers.)</li>
                            <li>Some packets may not arrive at all. (Solution: a protocol by which the sender knows that a packet needs to be resent if not acknowledged.)</li>
                          </ul>
                        They are <em>not</em> asked to solve other problems that the real TCP confronts:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Packets may arrive, but with incorrect contents. (Solution: Redundant data in the header computed from the correct contents, so that if the data are corrupted the receiver will recompute the header information and detect a mismatch.)</li>
                          <li>A naive implementation of TCP is likely to cause network congestion as packets fly back and forth between the two computers involved. The real TCP includes congestion control algorithms to mitigate this problem.</li>
                          <li>IP knows how to send a packet to another computer, but that isn't generally good enough; that remote computer will typically have several programs waiting for communication over the net, and so TCP implements the idea of a <em>socket</em> that belongs to a specific program running on the remote computer.</li>
                          </ul>
                        Consider discussing those issues with interested students.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            	</li>
            	<li><strong>Page 3: Open Protocols and Internet Abstraction Hierarchy.</strong>
            	  <ul>
            	    <li>The Internet is really the greatest example of how important <em>abstraction</em> is in permitting such a complicated social artifact to work. That's the best reason for students to be exposed to this material. Any programmer can write an Internet-based application because that app is supported by the solid framework of the three lower levels. Otherwise the app writer would need expertise in dozens of arcane problems.</li>
            	    <li>We mention briefly that the Internet is also a great example of the importance of <em>cooperation.</em> In a social era that glorifies competition as the source of all progress, the Internet is an amazing counterexample. Please don't let students skip over that text box without engaging with it.</li>
            	    <li>We equate the link layer with hardware, but that's a simplification. Virtual networks, built entirely out of software, are an example of a non-hardware link layer protocol.</li>
            	    <li>We don't talk about any protocols at the Internet layer other than IP itself, but there are several more, including experimental proposed IP replacements that run in parallel with IP over the same physical infrastructure.</li>
            	    <li>Similarly, at the Transport layer we emphasize TCP and its reliability role, mentioning UDP in passing, and ignoring such esoterica as the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP), designed for efficient transmissions to and from computers in outer space.</li>
            	    <li>And of course there are many, many specialized application protocols, some of which are used by routers to learn information about network connectivity, while others are for specific commercial organizations.</li>
          	      </ul>

			<h4>Essential Knowledge:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>EK 6.1.1B</strong> An end-to-end architectures facilitates connecting new devices and networks on the Internet.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.1.1C</strong> Devices and networks that make up the Internet are connected and communicate using addresses and protocols.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.1.1D</strong> The Internet and the systems built on it facilitate collaboration.</li>
				<li><strong>EK 6.1.1E</strong> Connecting new devices to the Internet is enabled by assignment of an Internet protocol (IP) address.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.1.1F</strong> The Internet is built on evolving standards, including those for addresses and names.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.1.1G</strong> The domain name system (DNS) translates names to IP addresses.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.1.1H</strong> The number of devices that could use an IP address has grown so fast that a new protocol (IPv6) has been established to handle routing of many more devices.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.1.1I</strong> Standards such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), IP, and simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) are developed and overseen by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.1A</strong> The Internet and the systems built on it are hierarchical and redundant.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.1C</strong> IP addresses are hierarchical.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.1D</strong> Routing on the Internet is fault tolerant and redundant.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2A</strong> Hierarchy and redundancy help systems scale.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2B</strong> The redundancy of routing (i.e., more than one way to route data) between two points on the Internet increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2D</strong> Interfaces and protocols enable widespread use of the Internet.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2E</strong> Open standards fuel the growth of the Internet.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2F</strong> The Internet is a packet-switched system through which digital data is sent by breaking the data into blocks of bits called packets, which contain both the data being transmitted and control information for routing the data.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2G</strong> Standards for packets and routing include transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP).</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2H</strong> Standards for sharing information and communicating between browsers and servers on the Web include HTTP and secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS).</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2I</strong> The size and speed of systems affect their use.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2J</strong> The bandwidth of a system is a measure of bit rate – the amount of data (measured in bits) that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2K</strong> The latency of a system is the time elapsed between the transmission and the receipt of a request.</li>
