		<h2>Lab 4: Cybersecurity</h2>
		<p>Students learn about various cybersecurity risks on the Internet (including the fundamental lack of DNS security and common security attacks) and review the basic concepts of cryptography.</p> 

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
			The 2 required lab pages could be split across 1-3 days (<strong>45-90 minutes</strong>). Expected times to complete follow:
			  <ul>
                <li>25-50 minutes (&lt; 1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-cybersecurity/1-cybersecurity.html">Cybersecurity</a></li>
                <li>20-40 minutes (&lt;1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-cybersecurity/2-cryptosecurity.html">Cryptosecurity</a></li>
                <li>If used, 90-120 minutes (2-3 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-cybersecurity/3-caesar-cipher.html">Caesar Cipher Project</a> (Teacher's Choice)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
        <div class="time">
        	<ul>
                <li>Lab 4 page 3: Caesar Cipher Project (Teacher's Choice)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

		<h3>Prepare:</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>As you do <a href="http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html">Computing in the News </a> with your students this week, look for news stories relating to issues of encryption. Highlight stories that might give students ideas for their research task at the end of the lab about innovations that need to transmit data securely.</li>
				<li>Students will read parts of <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=179" target="_blank">Chapter 5 of Blown to Bits</a>. Reading through the entire chapter will be helpful, especially to get a better understanding of the evolution of encryption methods and some details of public key encryption.</li>
