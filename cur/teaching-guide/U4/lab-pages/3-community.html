		<h2>Lab 3: Community and Online Interactions</h2>
		<div class="todo">This purpose statement needs a topic sentence. --MF, 12/21/17</div>
		<p>Students examine communications technology and discuss ways in which computing affects our ability to build community. This is a frequent topic in the media. There have been many examples of massive communities organizing almost instantly through Twitter, both for political purposes and in response to natural disasters. There have also been many examples of lonely teens whose social problems are said to be the result of online gaming taking over their lives. There have been <em>undesirable</em> online communities, with neo-Nazis heading the list. The Internet is said to be democratizing, giving a voice and a following to previously unknown leaders, and to be anti-democratizing, with repressive governments using it for propaganda and censoring opposing views, and super-rich technology companies such as Google and Facebook building up detailed, secret dossiers on each of us. Although &quot;community&quot; isn't an obviously focused social issue the way privacy and copyright are, it's of central importance to life in the 21st Century.</p>
		<p>Students learn about cyberbullying: why people bully, how computing affects the nature and seriousness of bullying, and how social decisions about technology (such as sites devoted to anonymous posting) affect the issue. This is a community issue of direct relevance to teenagers. Discussing cyberbullying also gets students to think about how the Internet can bring out the worst in people. This is a serious discussion about a potentially personal and sensitive topic, and is an opportunity to reinforce your classroom as a safe space to pursue these topics.</p>
        <p>Students then consider some issues of free speech and are confronted with the fact that a global Internet leads to issues when different countries have different standards for what should be censored. Students consider what rules (if any) ought to exist on the Internet and then learn of some of the practical difficulties of regulating Internet content. This is an opportunity for students to think further about their own role as digital citizens.</p>
        <p> Next, students learn about how search engines work. Students may be surprised to learn what is included and, sometimes more importantly, excluded from the results. Students will also think about the information that search engines can collect about your searches, and the implications of how the search engines might use that data.</p>
        <p>The international <em>digital divide</em> is the next topic to be considered.  This is an obvious social justice issue. The widespread availability of smartphones has changed the parameters of the problem, although there are still many villages in which one phone is shared by the entire population. Be sensitive to the possibility that some of your students may themselves be on the disadvantaged side of the divide.</p>
        <p>Finally, we have two pages on social benefits of computing and the Internet. As those pages explain, we don't give this topic equal time because the benefits take care of themselves, and it's the harms that need intervention by society, including our students. But some benefits aren't obvious, and we don't neglect them completely.</p>
        <p>
            Be aware that many potentially sensitive topics are addressed in this lab. Here are two examples:
            <ul>
                <li>Chapter 7 in <em>Blown to Bits</em> examines censorship primarily in terms of how pornographic materials are treated online. (Pornography is often the leading wedge of censorship efforts.) The students are not assigned reading from most of these sections, but students may read these sections and have questions or raise issues. Depending on your school and your students, it might be a good idea to bring this up yourself to try preemptively to set a serious tone for discussion.</li>
                <li>In materials about Internet censorship, specific countries are identified as having particularly harsh censorship policies. The United States is not immune from this, but be aware of statements that are made that appear to judge people of other nationalities. Part of the point of thinking through the social implications of these issues is to realize that these issues are not simple, and that different policies reflect different ways that societies have grappled with difficult and complex issues.</li>
            </ul>

							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Find out how some communications technologies work.</li>
								<li>Think about how computing affects our sense of community.</li>
                                <li>Understand that social media continue to evolve and foster new ways to communicate.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>Problem 2 asks students to conduct online research. As students work, make sure they visit more than one site to get their information.</li>
                                <li>The Take It Further video is not meant to be elaborate, but is a way to help students process what they learned in their online research. By having to explain it, they may come to understand what they read more clearly.</li>
                                <li>Problem 3 introduces two new topics. The statements "Computers are isolating" and "Computers are democratizing" will likely need to be explained to students. This <a href="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/isolating-democratizing.pptx" target="_blank" title="Computers and Community">PowerPoint about community</a> is a resource for you (you may share it with students if you wish) that gives examples of why/why not computers are isolating and why/why not computers are democratizing. Student discussions will be much better if you present at least some of these examples before they take positions.</li>
                                <li>This <a href="http://www.bostondebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Four-Corners-Narrative.pdf" target="_blank" title="Four Corners: Activity Narrative">Four Corners activity description</a> is taken from the Boston Debate League. As with any Four Corners activity, remember that this is a starting point for discussion, not an ending point; also, as always, remember that the best question to ask is not &quot;is X good or bad&quot; but rather &quot;in what ways is X good and bad for different groups of people, and how can we make it better?&quot;</li>
                                <li>Ask students to teach <em>you</em> about how they use the Internet to form and support communities. Some current media are quite recent, e.g., TikTok.</li>
                                <li>Remember that some aspects of adolescent community-building are timeless. Taylor Swift fandom happens to be built around the Internet, but it's not fundamentally different from Beatles fandom (except of course that the Beatles are forever) even though that didn't have the Internet. Look for ways in which the Internet truly changes things.</li>

					<strong>Page 2: Cyberbullying.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
                            <strong>Learning Goal:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Understand what cyberbullying is.</li>

                        </li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>There's only one socially acceptable position on bullying, but clearly not everyone agrees with it, or there wouldn't be any bullies. So this is a discussion in which you'll have to be especially careful to protect students' right to disagree. You're unlikely to hear a blanket defense of bullying, but, for example, some students may feel that retaliatory bullying (bullying the bully) is okay. Others may feel that if the First Amendment protects Nazi and KKK rallies, it should also protect cyberbullying. Bend over backward to make room for these opinions in the discussion.</li>
								<li>People use the name &quot;cyberbullying&quot; exclusively for actions of children and young adults, but keep in mind that older people engage in harassment of women in gamer contexts, in &quot;revenge porn,&quot; and a range of other, similar activities.</li>
								<li>Avoid leaving students with the feeling that it's their job to eliminate bullying. Students can help, but it's the obligation of adults to protect students, including protecting them from other students.</li>
                                <li>Have students work in small groups for 10-15 minutes researching the issue of cyberbullying online.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Students will engage in a 25-30 minute discussion. There are three parts to this discussion:
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>
                                            Share some of the findings from the online research on the question: <em>What are some different forms that cyberbullying can take?</em> Students can share stories they found or different definitions of cyberbullying.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Next, discuss: <em>What are some possible ways to effectively address this issue?</em> Students may choose to focus on what they can do individually, what they should think should happen in schools, or what should be done at a societal level.</li>
                                        <li>Finally, discuss: <em>What are the challenges to addressing cyberbullying?</em> For example, students may raise First Amendment rights, privacy issues regarding their communication, or the ability to assume other identities or operate anonymously online.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>

					<strong>Page 3: Censorship.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Consider their own views on censorship and learn about Internet censorship around the world.</li>
								<li>Understand the impacts of bullying and the impacts of restricting speech.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>Students have now thought about these issues a bit more. In this Four Corners activity, have students go to their Four Corners according to their views, but also ask students whether anyone has changed their minds about these issues over the last few days.</li>
                                <li>As part of the Four Corners activity, you can also give the opportunity for certain viewpoints to try to persuade people in the other groups to come to their corners.</li>
                                <li>The writing activity is an opportunity for students to construct a well-organized paragraph stating their view and evidence to support this view.</li>
                                <li>The second set of questions starts with a <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading about policies in different countries and how these policies interact with people and businesses in the U.S. The main point of this section is in question 5 which asks students to discuss or write about why they should care about what happens in other countries.</li>
                                <li>In the "Take It Further" problems, students can explore world maps at opennet.net, and read about the Arab Spring, which was famously associated with the power of social media.</li>

						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Page 4: Search Engines.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goal:</strong> Understand a search engine as a piece of software that provides results according to a unique algorithm, but ultimately controlled by human beings at search companies.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong> There are several ways students can engage with this page:
                            <ul>
                                <li>By comparing different search engines, students might think of not only the order in which results appear, but the aesthetics of how the information is displayed.</li>
                                <li>Students can also try to "fool" the search engine. They can try to type in phrases that can have multiple meanings to see what shows up. Students might consider how search engines can reflect cultural biases.</li>
                                <li>The information about filter bubbles at <a href="http://dontbubble.us/" target="_blank" title="DuckDuckGo Privacy">dontbubble.us (by DuckDuckGo)</a> gives one hint that search engines are not an objective representation of information on the Internet. This is one opportunity to talk about how the filtering of results has the potentially positive effect of tailoring your search results to reflect what you appear to care most about, but also has potentially negative effects of limiting the scope of information and opinions you think are out in the world, especially if you don't realize your search results are filtered.</li>
                                <li>Having students share their initial ideas of how search engines might work is meant to surface preconceptions and potential misconceptions students have about searching on the Internet. Students will likely also realize they've never really thought about how a search engine is able to access so much information on the Internet so quickly.</li>
                                <li>European law affects search results for privacy reasons; people have a &quot;right to be forgotten.&quot; (Look up &quot;dog poop girl&quot; for an example of why such a right might be important.) There is no such right in the US. Discuss whether students think there should be.</li>
                                <li>Depending on the class discussion, students may not have any ideas of why searching has social implications. The quotes point to the idea that controlling information is powerful. This might be one idea that students might consider.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Be aware that some of your students may themselves suffer from limited access to computing at home.</li>
                                <li>Students will look at some country level statistics about Internet usage.</li>
                                <li>Discuss as a class what the different column headings measure, and why each column is useful in getting a more complete picture of who in the world has access to the Internet.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Spend some time with problem 1(c), with students coming up with questions they have about Internet usage. You might even consider have students do some extra online research into some of their questions. Look for a variety of questions, such as:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>When was the Internet first introduced into these countries?</li>
                                        <li>What percent of people have a computer?</li>
                                        <li>Just because people have access to the Internet, does that mean they use it?</li>
                                        <li>How did these countries get to where they are? Are there different government policies? What are the differences in infrastructure?</li>
                                        <li>How much do people in different countries pay for Internet? Does the price vary a lot from country to country?</li>
                                        <li>and so on.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Students can have a discussion or write about the digital divide. Be aware that some students do not have a computer or Internet access at home. The digital divide can create an unfair society, but there are ways of addressing this divide, such as providing free Internet and advocating for more access to technology in schools. Also consider how more technology is not strictly positive. What are ways that our society might be affected negatively by the prevalence of technology?</li>
                                <li>The "Take It Further" prompts offer some other perspectives about computing in the U.S. and around the world. In TIF A, be aware that there are reasons to mistrust Facebook's motives in seeking to provide free Internet in poor areas.</li>

                                <li>But don't let students forget the critical stance (in the sense of &quot;investigative,&quot; not in the sense of &quot;oppositional&quot;) we want them to take about any digital innovation. Is anyone hurt by digital media? By crowdsourcing? The answers might be &quot;no,&quot; but make them ask the questions seriously.</li>

                                <li>There's a lot of text on this page, and it's about an issue that students really haven't experienced first-hand. Consider simulating a large-team project with a scavenger hunt, with clues divided among teams of three. For example, if a clue is &quot;Find an orange Sharpie with a narrow tip,&quot; clue card number 4 might say &quot;Sharpie with a&quot;: team members 2 and 15. Card 4 might share a different clue with cards 9 and 21. It's not a competition: the entire class wins when all the desired objects are accumulated. The point of the activity is for students to notice how hard it is to communicate with everyone yelling across the room.</li>
                                <li>But maybe some students <em>have </em>experienced culturally insensitive design. Ask whether anyone has used an app that seemed not to be designed with them in mind. (&quot;Youth&quot; is a cultural category they all share.)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
