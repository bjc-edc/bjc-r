		<h2>Programming Lab 4: Internet Security</h2>
		<p>On the first page, students learn about various cybersecurity risks on the Internet including the fundamental lack of DNS security, common security attacks (bug exploitation, viruses, phishing, etc.) and DoS and DDoS attacks. On the second page, students learn the basic concepts of cryptography and develop a simple encryption script.</p> 
		

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
			The 2 lab pages could be split across 1 or 2 days (50-80 minutes). Expected times to complete follow:
		  <ul>
				<li>10-20 minutes (&lt;1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-internet-security/1-cybersecurity.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Cybersecurity</a></li>
				<li>40-60 minutes (about 1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-internet-security/2-cryptography.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Cryptography

            <h3>Heartbleed Bug!</h3>
            <p>About one year ago, a bug of incredible magnitude was uncovered.  It was an incredibly serious security hole (aka vulnerability) in OpenSSL, which provides security and privacy for the Internet (web, email, IM, VPNs, etc).  </p>
