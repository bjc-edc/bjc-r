                    	I wasn't a huge fan of these questions, so I asked Jane, and here is what she suggested:<br />
                    	after reading stuff in BtB, they can generate a list of key ideas of the Internet – key features that would need to be there (or questions to be addressed) in any sort of re-design of the internet. So things like<br />
                        “where does content on the internet live?” or <br />
                        “what happens if information gets corrupted as it travels?” (to address ideas of redundancy) or <br />
                        “how can you make sure that new technology can be developed and added to the Internet” (like the hourglass idea and the internet being like an electrical plug) or <br />
                        “how can you make sure that huge files of the future are able to travel through the internet” (to get at the packet idea)… The idea being that a future version of the Internet might include some improvements (like maybe different ways of thinking about security), but it should at least work as well as our current internet does, which means that a lot of these desirable features would need to stay, and for good reason…

                <li><strong>EK6.1.1A</strong> The Internet connects devices and networks all over the world.</li>             	
                <li><strong>EK6.1.1D</strong> The Internet and the systems built on it facilitate collaboration.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.1.1C</strong> Devices and networks that make up the Internet are connected and communicate using addresses and protocols.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.2.2E</strong> Open standards fuel the growth of the Internet.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.2.2D</strong> Interfaces and protocols enable widespread use of the Internet.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.2.2G</strong> Standards for packets and routing include transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP).</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.1.1E</strong> Connecting new devices to the Internet is enabled by assignment of an Internet protocol (IP) address.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.1.1F</strong> The Internet is built on evolving standards, including those for addresses and names.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.1.1H</strong> The number of devices that could use an IP address has grown so fast that a new protocol (IPv6) has been established to handle routing of many more devices.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.1.1I</strong> Standards such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), IP, and simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) are developed and overseen by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.2.1A</strong> The Internet and the systems built on it are hierarchical and redundant.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.2.1C</strong> IP addresses are hierarchical.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.2.1D</strong> Routing on the Internet is fault tolerant and redundant.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.2.2A</strong> Hierarchy and redundancy help systems scale.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.2.2B</strong> The redundancy of routing (i.e., more than one way to route data) between two points on the Internet increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.2.2F</strong> The Internet is a packet-switched system through which digital data is sent by breaking the data into blocks of bits called packets, which contain both the data being transmitted and control information for routing the data.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.2.2H</strong> Standards for sharing information and communicating between browsers and servers on the Web include HTTP and secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS).</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.2.2I</strong> The size and speed of systems affect their use.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.2.2J</strong> The bandwidth of a system is a measure of bit rate – the amount of data (measured in bits) that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.2.2K</strong> The latency of a system is the time elapsed between the transmission and the receipt of a request.</li>
                <li><strong>EK6.3.1A</strong> The trust model of the Internet involves trade-offs.</li>
