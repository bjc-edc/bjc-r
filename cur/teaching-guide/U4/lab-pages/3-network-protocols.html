		<h3>As a Class:</h3>
		<div class="todo">from internet-garcia.html for TG as DQs:
            These questions may raise feelings of inequity in students. Consider anonimizing the collection of this data, e.g. by having students fill out an anonymous poll online or writing their response on a folded paper and dropping it in a fishbowl:<ul>
                <li>Take a moment and count: How many Internet-connected devices does your household own?</li>
                <li>How many Internet-connected devices are just for you?</li>
            </ul>
            Share the aggregated results with students, and ask:
            <ul>
                <li>What factors contribute to these numbers for different households and individuals?</li>
                <li>Under what curcumstances might people have fewer Internet-connected devices?</li>
                <li>Under what curcumstances might people have more Internet-connected devices?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="todo"> KEEP?? Discuss: Will people ever be able to build a computer inside a single atom?

How does DuckDuckGo know your IP address?  Why do web sites <em>need</em> to know your IP address?</p>
			<p>How would a student answer these questions? Should this be in the TG with some support? I don't know how to answer these questions... --MF</p>

                    	I wasn't a huge fan of these questions, so I asked Jane, and here is what she suggested:<br />
                    	after reading stuff in BtB, they can generate a list of key ideas of the Internet – key features that would need to be there (or questions to be addressed) in any sort of re-design of the internet. So things like<br />
                        “where does content on the internet live?” or <br />
                        “what happens if information gets corrupted as it travels?” (to address ideas of redundancy) or <br />
                        “how can you make sure that new technology can be developed and added to the Internet” (like the hourglass idea and the internet being like an electrical plug) or <br />
                        “how can you make sure that huge files of the future are able to travel through the internet” (to get at the packet idea)… The idea being that a future version of the Internet might include some improvements (like maybe different ways of thinking about security), but it should at least work as well as our current internet does, which means that a lot of these desirable features would need to stay, and for good reason…

                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2B</strong> The redundancy of routing (i.e., more than one way to route data) between two points on the Internet increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.</li>

                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2E</strong> Open standards fuel the growth of the Internet.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2F</strong> The Internet is a packet-switched system through which digital data is sent by breaking the data into blocks of bits called packets, which contain both the data being transmitted and control information for routing the data.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2G</strong> Standards for packets and routing include transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP).</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2H</strong> Standards for sharing information and communicating between browsers and servers on the Web include HTTP and secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS).</li>
