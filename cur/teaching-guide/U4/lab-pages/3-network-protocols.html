		<h2>Programming Lab 3: Network Protocols</h2>
		<p>This lab covers hexadecimal representation and the abstractions in the Internet (especially TCP/IP). The first page addresses hex (base 16) building on students' understanding of binary from <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 1</a> to support understanding of RGB colors used in HTML/CSS and IPv6 addresses. The remaining pages cover the Internet protocol suite, including IP Address Hierarchy, IPv4 vs. IPv6, packets and packet switching, reliable data transmission, open standards, and the internet abstraction hierarchy. Students identify the IP address of the computer they are using and use Snap<em>!</em> to scrape the results of a "my ip address" query to a Server engine to make a <code>my IP address</code> block.</p> 
		

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
			The 4 lab pages could be split across 3 or 4 days (135-173 minutes). Expected times to complete follow:
		  <ul>
				<li>45-55 minutes (1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-protocols/1-hexadecimal.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Hexadecimal Representation
</a></li>
				<li>30-40 minutes (&lt;1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-protocols/2-ip-routing.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">The Network of Networks: IP</a></li>
				<li>45-55 minutes (1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-protocols/3-tcp.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Reliable Transmission on Unreliable Networks: TCP</a></li>
				<li>15-25 minutes (&lt;1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-protocols/4-internet-abstraction-hierarchy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Open Protocols and Internet Abstraction Hierarchy</a></li>

		<h3>Prepare:</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/openers.html#computingnews" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> stories during this lab might address Net Neutrality. The FCC recently set new rules that (1) regulate broadband Internet providers like a public utility, and (2) prevent ISPs from charging certain companies (like YouTube) from priority delivery, and (3) will be challenged in courts. For example, consider this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/13/technology/fcc-releases-net-neutrality-rules.html" target="_blank">this article in the NY Times</a>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
        

		<h3>Students will:</h3>
		<div class="sidenoteBig">
			<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
            <ul>
				<li>In Lab 5, students will look at the vulnerabilities of the Internet and the security measures designed to address them. </li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	<div>
			<ul>

		<h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div>
        	<ul>
            	<li>
                	<strong>Page 1: Hexadecimal Representation.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Encourage students to take turns reading on this page.</li>
                        <li>Binary and hexadecimal representation can be a difficult topic for students, but mastery is not required here. The goal is for students to become <em>familiar with the basics</em> of hex. Consider translating between the representations for several numbers together at the board.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
				<li>
                	<strong>Page 2: The Network of Networks: IP.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        	Discussion: These discussion questions address the reading from <em>Blown to Bits</em> listed on the lab page and described in the "Assignments" section later on this page:
                            <ul>
                            	<li>What is a circuit-switched network? What is a packet-switched network? (This is addressed on page 302 of <em>Blown to Bits</em>.)</li>
                                <li>What is an ISP? Who is your ISP? (Some students may know their Internet Service Provider, and those who do not may recognize the name of theirs upon hearing responses from others. For example, here are <a href="https://www.nycbbmap.com/#/?modal=participating-isps" target="_blank">some ISPs in NYC</a>. This topic is addressed on page 303 of <em>Blown to Bits</em>.)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        	Discussion: Generate a list of key ideas of the Internet&mdash;that is, key features that would need to be there (or questions to be addressed) in any sort of re-design of the internet. Use these prompts to stimulate the discussion:
                            <ul>
                            	<li>Where does content on the internet live?</li>
                                <li>What happens if information gets corrupted as it travels?</li>
                                <li>How can you make sure that new technology can be developed and added to the Internet even if older systems are still in place?</li>
                                <li>How can you make sure that the huge files of the future are able to travel through the Internet built today?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        	Discussion: These discussion questions address the reading from <em>Blown to Bits</em> listed on the lab page and described in the "Assignments" section later on this page:
                            <ul>
                            	<li>What is a protocol? What does it do for the Internet? What are some examples?</li>
                                <li>What is redundancy? How does it make the Internet more reliable?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        	Discussion: These discussion questions address the code.org video "The Internet: Packets, Routing, and Reliability" included on the lab page:
                            <ul>
                            	<li>What does a packet contain? How does a packet-switched system work? (This is also addressed on page 302 of <em>Blown to Bits</em>.)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Discussion: This lab page includes a simulation of unreliable data transmission by Internet Protocol, and the last "For You To Do" item asks students to "Brainstorm what you could do to get around network unreliability." After students have had a chance to explore the simulation and consider this question, ask them to share their ideas. TCP sends meta-data along with each packet so that the receiving computer can reorder the packets and identify if there are any missing. How might this be accomplished in Snap<em>!</em> ?</li>
