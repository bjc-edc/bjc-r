		<title>Teaching Guide for Unit 4: The Internet and Global Impact</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h2>Programming Lab 1: Website Data</h2>
		<p>The lab begins with an introduction to the Internet that covers the difference between the World Wide Web and the Internet, URLs, the physical structure and history of Internet, network redundancy, and domain name hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Later in Unit 4, students will work with the <code>http</code> block as they scrape and process data from web pages. The last two pages of this lab prepare students for these projects by introducing the basics of HTML, the concept of HTTP, and the Snap<em>!</em> <code>http</code> block. The goal is for students to gain very basic familiarity with HTML and web page scraping.</p> 
        <p>
        	This lab also introduces a new lab page design element: "Do If There Is Time." This section is included to provide greater support for differentiation:
            <ul>
                <li>"For You to Do" problems should be <strong>completed by all</strong> students</li>
                <li>"Do If There Is Time" should be <strong>attempted by most</strong> students</li>
                <li>"Take It Further" is offered for those students who are moving most quickly.</li>
            </ul>
			The goal of this three-tiered approach is to help teachers keep all students moving through the lab pages at the same pace regardless of the pace of individual pairs.
        </p>

                            These questions may raise feelings of inequity in students. Consider anonimizing the collection of this data, e.g. by having students fill out an anonymous poll online or writing their response on a folded paper and dropping it in a fishbowl:<ul>
                                <li>Take a moment and count: How many Internet-connected devices does your household own?</li>
                                <li>How many Internet-connected devices are just for you?</li>
                            </ul>
                            Share the aggregated results with students, and ask:
                            <ul>
                                <li>What factors contribute to these numbers for different households and individuals?</li>
                                <li>Under what curcumstances might people have fewer Internet-connected devices?</li>
                                <li>Under what curcumstances might people have more Internet-connected devices?</li>
