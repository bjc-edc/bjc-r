		<h2>Programming Lab 1: Website Data</h2>
		<p>Later in Unit 4, students will work with the <code>http</code> block as they scrape and process data from web pages. These first two pages prepare students for these projects by introducing the basics of HTML, the concept of HTTP, and the Snap<em>!</em> <code>http</code> block. The goal is for students to gain very basic familiarity with HTML and web page scraping.</p> 
        <p>This lab also introduces a new lab page design element: "Do If There Is Time," which appears between the "For You to Do" and "Take It Further" sections. This section is included to provide greater support for differentiation. "For You to Do" problems should be completed by all students; "Do If There Is Time" should be attempted by most students; and "Take It Further" is offered for those students who are moving most quickly. The goal of this three-tiered approach is to help teachers keep all students moving through the lab pages at the same pace regardless of the pace of individual pairs.</p>
		

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
			The 2 lab pages could be split across X or X days (X-X minutes). Expected times to complete follow:
			<ul>
				<li>1-2 class periods on Writing for the Web with HTML</li>
				<li>X-X class periods on Reading the Web with Snap<em>!</em></li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<h3>Prepare:</h3>

                        <li>Discussion: After students work through the lab page, you might ask these questions:
                            <ul>
                                <li>What is HTTP? What does HTTP stand for and what does it do?</li>

		<h3>Assignments:</h3>
		<div>
        	<ul>
            	<li>
                	On Page 1: Writing for the Web with HTML, students are asked to prepare a written assignment that includes:
                	  <ul>
                    	<li>Descriptions of HTTP and HTML in their own words.</li>
                    	<li>Descriptions of what HTML and CSS can be used to do.</li>
                        <li>A list of several HTML formatting commands and what they do.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Students who work on the "Take It Further" activities may also write:
                    <ul>
                    	<li>A description of what JavaScript can be used to do.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

Although the "Do If There Is Time" and "Take It Further" sections suggest deeper inquiry with HTML (in class and out of school, respectively), please note that HTML is not included in the AP CSP Frameworks and no mastery is required.</li>
