		<h2>Programming Lab 1: Website Data</h2>
		<p>The lab begins with an introduction to the Internet that covers the difference between the World Wide Web and the Internet, URLs, the physical structure and history of the Internet, network redundancy, and the domain name hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Later in Unit 4, students will work with the <code>http</code> block as they scrape and process data from web pages. The last three pages of this lab prepare students for those projects by introducing the basics of HTML, the Snap<em>!</em> <code>http</code> block, and the process of importing web data into Snap<em>!</em> (either from a data file or by scraping  a web page). The goal is for students to gain very basic familiarity with HTML in order to support web page scraping.</p>
        <div class="comment">Aren't we going to retrofit "If There's Time" into all the units?  Also, I vote for changing "There Is" to "There's."--bh</div> 
        <p>
        	This lab also introduces a new lab page design element: "If There Is Time." This section is included to provide greater support for differentiation:
			<ul>
                <li>"For You to Do" problems should be <strong>completed by all</strong> students</li>
                <li>"If There Is Time" should be <strong>attempted by most</strong> students</li>
                <li>"Take It Further" is offered <strong>for those students who are moving most quickly</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
			The goal of this three-tiered approach is to help teachers keep all students moving through the lab pages at the same pace regardless of the pace of individual pairs.
        </p>
		<div class="todo">We should discuss next meeting, and then put in the TG Intro, a policy about whether teachers should try to match students by ability/experience within each pair, and if not, how to handle this pacing business.  And, speaking of pacing, we need to discuss and somehow fix the mythological pacing estimates throughout the course.--bh</div>

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>

		<h3>As a Class:</h3>
        <div>
        	<ul>
            	<li>
                	<strong>Page 1: The Basics of the Internet.</strong>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>
                        	Discussion: These discussion questions begin to cover the first and second essential questions for Big Idea 6: The Internet in the <a href="https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-curriculum-framework.pdf">AP CS Frameworks</a>.
                            <ul>
                                <li>What is the Internet? How is the Internet built? How does the Internet function?</li>
                                <li>What aspects of the Internet's design and development have helped it scale and flourish?</li>
                            </ul>
                            These questions are revisited in more detail in Lab 3.
                      </li>
                        <li>
                        	Discussion: These questions help students revisit the meaning and function of URLs:
                            <ul>
                                <li>What is a URL? What are the different parts of a URL?</li>
                                <li>What are the different parts of a domain name?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                	<strong>Page 2: Writing for the Web with HTML.</strong>
	                    <ul>
                        <li>Discussion: After students work through the lab page, you might ask these questions:
                            <ul>
                                <li>What is HTTP? How is it used?</li>
                                <li>What is HTML? How is it used?</li>
                                <li>What have you learned about HTML code?</li>
                                <li>How is HTML code different from coding with Snap<em>!</em>?</li>
                                <li>What is CSS? What have you learned about CSS code?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            	</li>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 4: Scraping Data from Web Pages.</strong>
                    <ul>
						<li>Discussion: These questions are designed to inspire students to think about what the world would be like without the Internet:
                        	<ul>
                                <li>In the last 3 years, what was the longest time stretch you have ever been without Internet? Responses may range from several hours to several weeks or more.</li>
                                <li>What other times have you not had Internet access when you needed it?</li>
                                <li>What was the impact of not having the Internet? How did you work around the issue?</li>
                                <li>What if there were no Internet at all? Identify a task you use the Internet for and suggest how people might accomplish the same thing without Internet access?</li>
                            </ul>
						</li>
                    </ul>

        </div>


		<h3>Assignments:</h3>
		<div>
        	<ul>
            	<li>
                	On Page 2: Writing for the Web with HTML, students are asked to prepare a written assignment that includes:
                	  <ul>
                    	<li>Descriptions of what HTML and CSS can be used to do.</li>
                        <li>A list of several HTML formatting commands and what they do.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Students who work on the "Take It Further" activities may also write:
                    <ul>
                    	<li>A description of what JavaScript can be used to do.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="todo">The more I think about it, the less comfortable I am with these "what X can do" assignments, because they are based on a really small, toy sample of each language.  Javascript, in particular, is a general purpose, Turing-equivalent language; it can do anything a computer can do!  I think this could be improved by systematically replacing that wording, here and in the student page, with something like "what you used X to do."  And maybe a compare-and-contrast (someday someone should explain to me why that isn't redundant...) asking students to discuss why they think there isn't just one language for web pages -- although the answer to that is partly historical accident. --bh</div>
                </li>
                <li>On Page 4: Scraping Data from Web Pages, students develop two Snap<em>!</em> project files (U4L2-GPSData and U4L5-WeatherApp) for use in later Unit 4 Labs.</li>
            </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>There is a lot of reading on this page. Mix it up to keep students engaged. Encourage students to take turns reading, read some sections together as a class, or consider assigning different teams to the various sections of the page and have each team present the basic ideas from their section to the class. Choose a strategy that will work for your group of students.</li>
                    </ul>
            	</li>
            	<li>
                	<strong>Page 2: Writing for the Web with HTML.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep in mind that this page is designed as a very basic introduction to HTML and only to support use of the <code>http</code> block. You may suggest deeper inquiry with HTML (on students' own time) to the more engaged and advanced students, but please note that HTML is not included in the AP CSP Frameworks and no mastery is required. The purpose of introducing it is so that students will recognize it when they see it and have a very basic understanding of its syntax and structure.</li>
                        <li>There's a lot of history behind the current Web standards. The original theory was that web servers provide information, and it's the job of the <em>browser</em> to decide how to format that information for presentation to the user. In principle this is still true; for example, there is an HTML tag &lt;i&gt; for Italics, but you're not supposed to use it; you're supposed to say &lt;em&gt; for emphasis, and in principle a browser might choose to use boldface, or red letters, or speaking in a louder voice, to convey the emphasis to the user. But since the early days, the profession of &quot;Web designer&quot; has arisen as a blight upon the land, and now servers generally attempt to control the formatting and presentation as well as providing information. This is especially a problem for visually impaired users, who configure their browsers to try to optimize the presentation for their needs. If students show interest in understanding Web design, consider assigning as homework that for this week they should set their browser's minimum font size to 20, a common accommodation for the farsighted, and keep a log of which of the web sites they visit still work and which are broken because they make assumptions about the screen size of a block of text.
                          <ul>
                            <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was introduced in part to try to tame server-side formatting by allowing CSS code in a browser to override CSS elements in served Web pages. Originally everything done by CSS was done directly in HTML. (CSS serves other purposes, too; in effect it introduced abstraction to HTML by supporting named subprocedures, much as Snap<em>!</em> introduced subprocedures into Scratch scripts.)</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            	</li>

                	<strong>Page 3: Reading the Web with Snap<em>!</em></strong>
                	<ul>
						<li>The HTML students will encounter on this page and in later labs where they acquire data from websites directly through Snap<em>!</em> is complicated-looking and would take an experienced HTML developer significant time to decode. While it can be valuable for students to skim the code that they see for elements that they recognize, watch that students don't get too caught up in the HTML. The goal here is accessing specific data within the code.</li>

						<li>Students will use the two project files that they develop in this lab (U4L2-GPSData and U4L5-WeatherApp) again later in this unit. Take care to ensure that each pair programming team completes and saves the two files on this page to ensure that students are well-prepared for Labs 2 and 5.</li>
                        <li>Students may need support with the <code>split</code> block or with lists of lists. There are several ways to develop the code for the list of lists, but using <code>map</code> is recommended.</li>
