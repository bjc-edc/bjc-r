		<h2>Programming Lab 1: Website Data</h2>
		<p>In Labs 2 and 4, students will work with the <code>http</code> block as they scrape and process data from web pages. These first two pages prepare students for these projects by introducing the basics of HTML, the concept of HTTP, and the Snap<em>!</em> <code>http</code> block. The goal is for students to gain very basic familiarity with HTML and web page scaping.</p> 
        <p>This lab also introduces a new lab page design element: "If There Is Time," which appears between the "For You to Do" and "Take It Further" sections. This section is included to provide greater support for differentiation. "For You to Do" problems should be completed by all students; "If There is Time" should be attempted by most students; and "Take It Further" is offered for those students who are moving most quickly. The goal of this three-tiered approach is to help teachers keep all students moving through the lab pages at the same pace regardless of the pace of individual pairs.</p>
