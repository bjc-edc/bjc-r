		<h2>Lab 4: Community and Online Interactions</h2>
		<div class="todo">This purpose statement needs a topic sentence. Also, the assignment link needs attention. --MF, 12/21/17</div>
		<p>Students then examine communications technology and discuss ways in which computing affects our ability to build community. They then learn about cyberbullying: why people bully, how computing affects the nature and seriousness of bullying, and how social decisions about technology (such as sites devoted to anonymous posting) affect the issue. Discussing cyberbullying also gets students to think about how the Internet can bring out the worst in people. This is a serious discussion about a potentially personal and sensitive topic, and is an opportunity to reinforce your classroom as a safe space to pursue these topics.</p>
        <p>Students then consider some issues of free speech and are confronted with the fact that a global Internet leads to issues when different countries have different standards for what should be censored. Students consider what rules (if any) ought to exist on the Internet and then learn of some of the practical difficulties of regulating Internet content. This is an opportunity for students to think further about their own role as digital citizens. Students then consider some issues of free speech and are confronted with the fact that a global Internet leads to issues when different countries have different standards for what should be censored.</p>
        <p> Finally, students learn about how search engines work. Students may be surprised to learn what is included and, sometimes more importantly, excluded from the results. Students will also think about the information that search engines can collect about your searches, and the implications of how the search engines might use that data.</p>
        <p>
            Beware that many potential sensitive topics are addressed on these pages:
            <ul>
                <li>Chapter 7 in <em>Blown to Bits</em> examines censorship primarily in terms of how pornographic materials are treated online. The students are not assigned reading from most of these sections, but students may read these sections and have questions or raise issues.</li>
                <li>In materials about Internet censorship, specific countries are identified as having particularly harsh censorship policies. The United States is not immune from this, but be aware of statements that are made that appear to judge people of other nationalities. Part of the point of thinking through the social implications of these issues is to realize that these issues are not simple, and that different policies reflect different ways that societies have grappled with difficult and complex issues.</li>
            </ul>

                                <li>Problem 2 asks students to conduct online research. As students work, make sure they visit more than one site to get their information.</li>
                                <li>The Take It Further video is not meant to be elaborate, but is a way to help students process what they learned in their online research. By having to explain it, they may come to understand what they read more clearly.</li>
                                <li>Problem 3 introduces two new topics. The statements "Computers are isolating" and "Computers are democratizing" will likely need to be explained to students. This <a href="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/isolating-democratizing.pptx" target="_blank" title="Computers and Community">PowerPoint about community</a> is a resource for you (you may share it with students if you wish) that gives examples of why/why not computers are isolating and why/why not computers are democratizing. Student discussions will be much better if you present at least some of these examples before they take positions.</li>

						<li>
                            <strong>Learning Goal:</strong> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Understand what cyberbullying is.</li>
                                <li>Understand how to identify cyberbullying and how to help prevent it.</li>

                        </li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>There's only one socially acceptable position on bullying, but clearly not everyone agrees with it, or there wouldn't be any bullies. So this is a discussion in which you'll have to be especially careful to protect students' right to disagree. You're unlikely to hear a blanket defense of bullying, but, for example, some students may feel that retaliatory bullying (bullying the bully) is okay. Others may feel that if the First Amendment protects Nazi and KKK rallies, it should also protect cyberbullying. Bend over backward to make room for these opinions in the discussion.</li>
                                <li>Have students work in small groups for 10-15 minutes researching the issue of cyberbullying online.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Students will engage in a 25-30 minute discussion. There are three parts to this discussion:
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>
                                            Share some of the findings from the online research on the question: <em>What are some different forms that cyberbullying can take?</em> Students can share stories they found or different definitions of cyberbullying.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Next, discuss: <em>What are some possible ways to effectively address this issue?</em> Students may choose to focus on what they can do individually, what they should think should happen in schools, or what should be done at a societal level.</li>
                                        <li>Finally, discuss: <em>What are the challenges to addressing cyberbullying?</em> For example, students may raise First Amendment rights, privacy issues regarding their communication, or the ability to assume other identities or operate anonymously online.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Page 3: Censorship.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Consider their own views on censorship and learn about Internet censorship around the world.</li>
								<li>Understand the impacts of bullying and the impacts of restricting speech.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
                                <li>Students have now thought about these issues a bit more. In this Four Corners activity, have students go to their Four Corners according to their views, but also ask students whether anyone has changed their minds about these issues over the last few days.</li>
                                <li>As part of the Four Corners activity, you can also give the opportunity for certain viewpoints to try to persuade people in the other groups to come to their corners.</li>
                                <li>The writing activity is an opportunity for students to construct a well-organized paragraph stating their view and evidence to support this view.</li>
                                <li>The second set of questions starts with a <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading about policies in different countries and how these policies interact with people and businesses in the U.S. The main point of this section is in question 5 which asks students to discuss or write about why they should care about what happens in other countries.</li>
                                <li>In the "Take It Further" problems, students can explore world maps at opennet.net, and read about the Arab Spring, which was famously associated with the power of social media.</li>
                            </ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Page 4: Search Engines.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Learning Goal:</strong> Understand a search engine as a piece of software that provides results according to a unique algorithm.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong> There are several ways students can engage with this page:
                            <ul>
                                <li>By comparing different search engines, students might think of not only the order in which results appear, but the aesthetics of how the information is displayed.</li>
                                <li>Students can also try to "fool" the search engine. They can try to type in phrases that can have multiple meanings to see what shows up. Students might consider how search engines can reflect cultural biases.</li>
                                <li>The information about filter bubbles at <a href="http://dontbubble.us/" target="_blank" title="DuckDuckGo Privacy">dontbubble.us (by DuckDuckGo)</a> gives one hint that search engines are not an objective representation of information on the Internet. This is one opportunity to talk about how the filtering of results has the potentially positive effect of tailoring your search results to reflect what you appear to care most about, but also has potentially negative effects of limiting the scope of information and opinions you think are out in the world, especially if you don't realize your search results are filtered.</li>
                                <li>Having students share their initial ideas of how search engines might work is meant to surface preconceptions and potential misconceptions students have about searching on the Internet. Students will likely also realize they've never really thought about how a search engine is able to access so much information on the Internet so quickly. Students will read about search engines on the next page, so there's no need to correct all the misconceptions now; it is enough to have students realize there's a dissonance between what they thought they knew and what must actually be happening.</li>
                                <li>Depending on the class discussion, students may not have any ideas of why searching has social implications. The quotes point to the idea that controlling information is powerful. This might be one idea that students might consider. If students don't have many ideas, it is okay to move on to other pages of the lab without fully diving into this question.</li>
