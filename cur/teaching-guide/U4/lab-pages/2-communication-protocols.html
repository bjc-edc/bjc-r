		<h2>Lab 2: Communication Protocols</h2>
		<p>This lab is central to students' understanding of the abstractions that make the Internet work (especially TCP/IP). </p>
		<p>The first three pages cover the Internet protocol suite including IP Address Hierarchy, IPv4 vs. IPv6, packets and packet switching, reliable data transmission, open standards, and the Internet abstraction hierarchy. On the last page, Who's In Charge of the Internet?, students learn about the organizations controlling the communication standards and addressing systems for the Internet.</p>
        <p>Encourage students to take turns reading.</p>

								<li>
                                    This page just skims the surface of IP. An end-user's computer typically has just three cases to consider:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Is this <em>my own</em> IP address? If so, don't use the network at all; send the message by software to another process on this same computer.</li>
                                        <li>If not, is this another computer on my local net? If so, use the appropriate link layer protocol to tell my network hardware to send the message directly to that other computer.</li>
                                        <li>Otherwise, send the message to my router, which is typically computer number 1 on my local net.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    But routers at ISPs have a hugely complicated job.  Because of redundant hardware connections, they can't just look up "the" route to the desired computer.  They have to consider alternate routes, check on how long it's taken to get messages across the net using each route recently, and pick the best one.  Also, it used to be that routers could be pretty confident about heuristics such as "if the address starts with 128 it's in the USA," but the advent of <em>virtual private networks</em> means that my laptop can pretend to be on the Berkeley campus when it's actually physically in Korea. None of this is on the AP syllabus.

					<strong>Page 2: Reliable Transmission on Unreliable Networks: TCP.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Learning Goal:</strong> Understand that TCP provides reliability of communication through counting, labeling, and ordering packets and implementing verification. </li>
                        <!--<li>(+) Understand that HTTP works on top of TCP.</li>-->
						<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> This lab page includes a simulation of unreliable data transmission by Internet Protocol. After students have had a chance to explore the simulation, ask them to share their ideas for how to change the project to transmit data reliably. TCP sends header data along with each packet so that the receiving computer can reorder the packets and identify if there are any missing. How might this be accomplished in Snap<em>!</em>? Students can try this for themselves in the "Take It Further" section.</li>

                        <li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>The project included in this page simulates unreliable packet transmission using IP for students to consider how they might address the unreliability. More advanced students can attempt to develop their own version of TCP in the Take It Further section at the bottom of the page. That's a challenging programming project, but even students who are not completely successful at it will gain a deeper appreciation of the importance of TCP.</li>
                                <li>
                                    In the TCP project, students are asked to solve two problems:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Packets may arrive out of order. (Solution: serial numbers in the packet headers.)</li>
                                        <li>Some packets may not arrive at all. (Solution: a protocol by which the sender knows that a packet needs to be resent if not acknowledged.)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    They are <em>not</em> asked to solve other problems that the real TCP confronts:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Packets may arrive, but with incorrect contents. (Solution: redundant data in the header is computed from the correct contents so that if the data are corrupted, the receiver will recompute the header information and detect a mismatch.)</li>
                                        <li>A naive implementation of TCP is likely to cause network congestion as packets fly back and forth between the two computers involved. The real TCP includes congestion control algorithms to mitigate this problem.</li>
                                        <li>IP knows how to send a packet to another computer, but that isn't generally good enough; the remote computer will typically have several programs waiting for communication over the net, and so TCP implements the idea of a <em>socket</em> that belongs to a specific program running on the remote computer.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Consider discussing those issues with interested students.

                                <li>What is the Internet? How is the Internet built? How does the Internet function? (These are essential questions for Big Idea 6: The Internet in the <a href="https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-curriculum-framework.pdf#page=39" target="_blank" title="AP CSP Big Idea 6: The Internet">AP CS Frameworks</a>.)</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>The Internet is a great example of how important <em>abstraction</em> is in permitting such a complicated social artifact to work. Any programmer can write an Internet-based application because that app is supported by the solid framework of the three lower levels. Otherwise the app writer would need expertise in dozens of arcane problems.</li>
                                <li>The student pages mentions briefly that the Internet is also a great example of the importance of <em>cooperation.</em> In a social era that glorifies competition, the Internet is an amazing counterexample.</li>
                                <li>
                                    This student page simplifies the Internet Abstraction Hierarchy:
                                      <ul>
                                        <li>The student pages equates the Link Layer with hardware, but that's a simplification. Virtual networks, built entirely out of software, are an example of a non-hardware Link Layer protocol.</li>
                                        <li>The student pages don't address any protocols at the Internet layer other than IP itself, but there are several more, including experimental proposed IP replacements that run in parallel with IP over the same physical infrastructure.</li>
                                        <li>Similarly, at the Transport layer we emphasize TCP and its reliability role, mentioning UDP in passing and ignoring such esoterica as the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP), designed for efficient transmissions to and from computers in outer space.</li>
                                        <li>And of course there are many, many specialized Application protocols, some of which are used by routers to learn information about network connectivity, while others are for specific commercial organizations.</li>

			<h4>Enduring Understandings:</h4>
			<p>Students consider how the characteristics (e.g., technical limitations and open standards) of the Internet influence the autonomous systems on the network (<strong>EU 6.1</strong>, <strong>EU 6.2</strong>). This lab builds toward these EUs by focusing on the TCP/IP protocols. The lab presents text and video on IP address hierarchy, IPv4 and IPv6, TCP, and open standards, it and requires students to explore a simulation demonstrating the need for TCP and review and discuss the basic abstractions of the Internet.</p>
			<ul>
            	<li><strong>EU 6.1</strong> The Internet is a network of autonomous systems.</li>
                <li><strong>EU 6.2</strong> Characteristics of the Internet influence the systems built on it.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
			<div class="todo">Brian, this LO paragraph is new. Let's remove this comment once you have reviewed it. --MF, 2/21/18</div>

			<h4>Essential Knowledge:</h4>
			<ul>
            	<li><strong>EK 2.2.3D</strong> In an abstraction hierarchy, higher levels of abstraction (the most general concepts) would be placed toward the top and lower level abstractions (the more specific concepts) toward the bottom.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.1.1B</strong> An end to end architecture facilitates connecting new devices and networks on the Internet.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.1.1C</strong> Devices and networks that make up the Internet are connected and communicate using addresses and protocols.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.1.1D</strong> The Internet and the systems built on it facilitate collaboration.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.1.1E</strong> Connecting new devices to the Internet is enabled by assignment of an Internet protocol (IP) address.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.1.1F</strong> The Internet is built on evolving standards, including those for addresses and names.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.1.1H</strong> The number of devices that could use an IP address has grown so fast that a new protocol (IPv6) has been established to handle routing of many more devices.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.1.1I</strong> Standards such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), IP, and simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) are developed and overseen by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.1A</strong> The Internet and the systems built on it are hierarchical and redundant.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.1D</strong> Routing on the Internet is fault tolerant and redundant.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2B</strong> The redundancy of routing (i.e., more than one way to route data) between two points on the Internet increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2D</strong> Interfaces and protocols enable widespread use of the Internet.</li>
