		<h2>Programming Lab 2: GPS Data</h2>
		<p>In this lab, students use Snap<em>!</em> to model and process a batch of GPS coordinates representing the locations of potential clients for a new restaurant in New York City. Building on the work on reading data from Lab 1, students create an appropriately scaled model of the data and analyze it to determine the optimal location for the new business.</p>

		<h3>Assignments:</h3>
		<div>
            <ul>
				<li>Students will develop two pieces of work in this lab: a project to visualize the GPS data at a scale where the shape of the data can be seen, and a project to identify and extract subsets (clusters) of the full data.</li>
                <li>
                    Assessment Idea: 
                    <ul>
                    	<li>
                        	<strong>Treasure Hunt!</strong> The set of GPS coordinates in this <a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/4-internet/U4L2Q-Treasure-Hunt.xml" target="_blank">XML Snap<em>!</em> project file</a> has been translated (a shift has been performed, but no dilation) so that they are distributed around the origin (0,0). The first point is actually the coordinates of the Boston Public Library in Boston, MA. Translate the points back so that they are distributed correctly. Then find the average latitude and longitude of the points. The corresponding location is the location of the treasure. What is the street address of the treasure?
                            <ul>

                	<strong>Page 1: GPS Coordinates.</strong>
                    <ul>
						<li>Do not address the details of latitude and longitude on this page; this topic is addressed on the following page.</li>
                        <li>It may help to discuss smartphones, which have GPS tracking, and briefly mention the network of satellites that provide the information.</li>
						<li>GPS signals are not part of any cellular phone network, and there are many devices with GPS that are not connected to the Internet.</li>
                    </ul>
            	</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>When discussing longitude and latitude, be especially mindful of students reversing the order. Matching the words "longitude" and "long" can help, especially if you emphasize with your hands the left-right direction when saying "long".</li>
						<li>Watch for students making errors when asked to subtract or add from each latitude and longitude, both in reversing the order and in reversing the operation. Correct plots here will center at (0,0) on the stage. If students ask why this step is needed, note that the centering to (0,0) allows the next step (scaling the data) to be done more simply.</li>
						<li>Some students may need a reminder about the <code>clear</code> block to reset the stage.</li>
						<li>There is more than one possible answer for the scale factor of data, typically any number between 200 and 1000 is good. Watch for students testing a series of very low values for the scale factor (2, 3, 4...), perhaps suggesting they jump to 10 or 100. At 100, some data separation starts to appear, and they should be fine from then. Less often, students may use an excessively large scale factor that pushes all the data off the stage completely; encourage them to find a value that makes the data visible, and they should be fine from then.</li>
                    </ul>
            	</li>
        		<li>
                	<strong>Page 3: Analyzing GPS Data.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Watch for students calculating the average GPS coordinates, then just plotting the average on the stage, instead of performing the data transformations. It may be helpful to have students use list operations to "add" the average as new coordinates in the original GPS data set temporarily, since the transformation code has already been written. If doing this, have students remove this before doing the clustering work.</li>
						<li>If students are having trouble understanding the result of the averaging calculation, have them plot the location using a mapping service, then compare the location to the data presented in the map on this page. This should offer a more realized visualization than the one available in Snap<em>!</em>.</li>
						<li>The description for the <code>zone</code> block is deliberately vague about how students declare the output. Most will probably choose numerical output (1, 2, 3). Look for students choosing text output ("Brooklyn" or "bottom") and highlight this option to the rest of the class.</li>
						<li>You could ask students how they might use <code>map</code> to create a single list containing latitude, longitude, and zone. This task is not necessary to complete the work in this lab, but is an interesting application of list operations.</li>
                    </ul>
