		<p>Later in Unit 4, students will work with the <code>http</code> block as they scrape and process data from web pages. The last three pages of this lab prepare students for those projects by introducing the basics of HTML, the Snap<em>!</em> <code>http</code> block, and the process of importing web data into Snap<em>!</em> (either from a data file or by scraping  a web page). The goal is for students to gain very basic familiarity with HTML in order to support web page scraping.</p>
        <p>In this lab, students build a weather app, starting from their work <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-web-data/3a-scraping.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">scraping data from web pages in Lab 1</a>. They will scrape a weather website for information, importing HTML to Snap<em>!</em>. They will produce a multi-city weather report, and use IP address information to determine information about current local conditions.</p>

                	<strong>Page 2: Writing for the Web with HTML.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep in mind that this page is designed as a very basic introduction to HTML and only to support use of the <code>http</code> block. You may suggest deeper inquiry with HTML (on students' own time) to the more engaged and advanced students, but please note that HTML is not included in the AP CSP Frameworks and no mastery is required. The purpose of introducing it is so that students will recognize it when they see it and have a very basic understanding of its syntax and structure.</li>
                        <li>There's a lot of history behind the current Web standards. The original theory was that web servers provide information, and it's the job of the <em>browser</em> to decide how to format that information for presentation to the user. In principle this is still true; for example, there is an HTML tag &lt;i&gt; for Italics, but you're not supposed to use it; you're supposed to say &lt;em&gt; for emphasis, and in principle a browser might choose to use boldface, or red letters, or speaking in a louder voice, to convey the emphasis to the user. But since the early days, the profession of &quot;Web designer&quot; has arisen as a blight upon the land, and now servers generally attempt to control the formatting and presentation as well as providing information. This is especially a problem for visually impaired users, who configure their browsers to try to optimize the presentation for their needs. If students show interest in understanding Web design, consider assigning as homework that for this week they should set their browser's minimum font size to 20, a common accommodation for the farsighted, and keep a log of which of the web sites they visit still work and which are broken because they make assumptions about the screen size of a block of text.
                          <ul>
                            <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was introduced in part to try to tame server-side formatting by allowing CSS code in a browser to override CSS elements in served Web pages. Originally everything done by CSS was done directly in HTML. (CSS serves other purposes, too; in effect it introduced abstraction to HTML by supporting named subprocedures, much as Snap<em>!</em> introduced subprocedures into Scratch scripts.)</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                	<strong>Page 3: Reading the Web with Snap<em>!</em></strong>
                	<ul>
						<li>The HTML students will encounter on this page and in later labs where they acquire data from websites directly through Snap<em>!</em> is complicated-looking and would take an experienced HTML developer significant time to decode. While it can be valuable for students to skim the code that they see for elements that they recognize, watch that students don't get too caught up in the HTML. The goal here is accessing specific data within the code.</li>

						<li>Students will use the two project files that they develop in this lab (U4L2-GPSData and U4L5-WeatherApp) again later in this unit. Take care to ensure that each pair programming team completes and saves the two files on this page to ensure that students are well-prepared for Labs 2 and 5.</li>
                        <li>Students may need support with the <code>split</code> block or with lists of lists. There are several ways to develop the code for the list of lists, but using <code>map</code> is recommended.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>There is more than one correct way to complete the URL tag for Google. Many students will find <code>http://www.google.com/search?q=snap</code> instead of the version listed on the page. Both are acceptable and either can be used to complete the task here.</li>
						<li>Be sure to discuss the use of pluses in multi-word searches such as <strong>new+york</strong>. This will be useful throughout the lab. It may also be useful to point out that this notation isn't universal, and that the use and notation for URL tags may change for other sites.</li>
						<li>Students shouldn't have much trouble finding the Snap<em>!</em> blocks to build the URL for this task. They may need a reminder about what directories to look in, and may need a reminder about the proper use of the <code>proxied http</code> block.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
							<li>Up front, check to see that the <code>substring</code> blocks are available in students' working projects. If they continue from the project started on the previous page, these blocks will already be loaded. The <code>substring</code> blocks are necessary for the work of extracting the current temperature and conditions from longer lines of text. Students may need some help and reminders about how these blocks behave, notably that there are two different blocks for the beginning and end of strings.</li>
                        <li>Watch for students making errors in building the URL tags for Weatherstreet. Specifically, state names must be listed, and without a space: <strong>Boston,MA</strong> and not <strong>Boston, MA</strong> or <strong>Boston</strong>. Multi-word city names must use a plus, not a space, between names: <strong>New+York,NY</strong> not <strong>New York,NY</strong>. In general, if this remains a difficult issue, you can ask students to enter ZIP codes instead of city names. This simplification applies throughout the rest of this lab.</li>
						<li>Students may have a difficult time figuring out how to extract the useful lines from Weatherstreet. Let them know that the relevant lines have unique identifiers in the HTML source. If students still have trouble, show them the lines: the current temperature line has the identifier <code>currenttemp</code>, and the current condition has the identifier <code>currentwx2</code>.</li>
						<li>There is more than one way, but in order to uniquely find these lines within the HTML source, consider having students return only the body of HTML and ignore the head; this was done previously in Lab 1. Alternately, they can choose the specific useful line after a <code>keep</code> operation.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If students choose to allow "cleaner" city entries like <strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong> they will need to process this using either <code>substring</code> or the blocks that convert between words and lists. This step may prove to be very difficult for some. If time is tight, consider dropping this option and have students use formatted entries like <strong>Los+Angeles,CA</strong> or ZIP codes.</li>
						<li>Watch for students avoiding list operations in both the gathering and communicating of information. A single <code>map</code> operation can be used to do each. In particular, students often forget they can include the original information as part of the result of <code>map</code>, then have trouble linking their data to the original.</li>
						<li>Students working on the Take It Further will need to find ways in the HTML source to extract the additional information. If doing so, encourage them to create blocks, so they can continue this work during the follow-up activity.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Students should already have familiarity building the <code>my IP address</code> block from Lab 4. They may need to import this block to their weather app project. If that block was not built in Lab 4, they can use <code>ipinfo.io</code> to determine their IP.</li>
						<li>It may be unclear to students how to quickly get the city and state from the IP address. While it is possible to use the HTML source from the main page of <code>ipinfo.io</code>, it is much more efficient to use the direct page links to city and state.</li>
						<li>Students may have difficulty here compiling the city and state information into the formatted text required by Weatherstreet, particularly for multi-word city names. Give students an opportunity to try it, but if it proves too difficult, have them use the <code>ipinfo.io/xx.xx.xx.xx/postal</code> option to retrieve the ZIP code for their current location, then use the ZIP code as the URL tag for Weatherstreet.</li>
						<li>Remind students there are multiple possible weather conditions that might cause the <code>umbrella</code> block to report true, including <strong>drizzle</strong> and <strong>heavy rain</strong>. This is a spot for some creativity, especially if students want to build a reporter instead of a predicate.</li>
