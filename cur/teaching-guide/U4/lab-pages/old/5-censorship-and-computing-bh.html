<h2>Lab 5: Censorship and Computing around the World</h2>
<p>This lab takes the broad structure and content of <em>Blown to Bits</em> Chapter 7. Students first consider what rules (if any) ought to exist on the Internet and then learn of some of the practical difficulties of regulating Internet content. This is also an opportunity for students to think further about their own role as digital citizens. Students then consider some issues of free speech and are confronted with the fact that a global Internet leads to issues when different countries have different standards for what should be censored. Finally, students take this opportunity to examine some statistics for Internet use around the world.</p> 
<p>
Be aware that many potential sensitive topics are addressed on these pages.  The general topic of censorship can't be understood by looking only at easy cases.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first page of the lab has a case study about a KKK leader arrested in 1964 for advocating violence against "n_____."</li>
  <li>The first story in the <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading is about a romantic connection online. While dramatic, this particular story did not have a devastating end, but it is possible that students may have experienced stalking or worse online.</li>
  <li>Chapter 7 in <em>Blown to Bits</em> examines censorship largely in terms of how pornographic materials are treated online. Students may read these sections and have questions or raise issues. Page 4 of the lab, which is about pornography, is marked Teacher's Choice.</li>
  <li>In materials about Internet censorship, specific countries are identified as having particularly harsh censorship policies. The United States is not immune from this, but be aware of statements that are made that appear to judge people of other nationalities. Part of the point of thinking through the social implications of these issues is to realize that these issues are not simple, and that different policies reflect different ways that societies have grappled with difficult and complex issues.</li>
  <li>Finally, students will discuss the "digital divide" at the end of this Lab. Be aware of students who themselves do not have a computer at home, and may be embarrassed by this topic.		</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pacing:</h3>
<div>
  There are five pages in this lab. The lab pages could be split across 4 or 5 days (<strong>200-250 minutes</strong>). Expected times to complete follow:
  <ul>
    <li>30-40 minutes on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/5-censorship/1-harmful-speech.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Harmful Speech</a></li>
    <li>30-40 minutes on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/5-censorship/2-worldwide-censorship.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Worldwide Censorship</a></li>
    <li>35-45 minutes on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/5-censorship/3-regulating-the-internet.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Regulating the Internet</a></li>

  </ul>
</div>


<h3>Prepare:</h3>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/openers.html#computingnews" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> stories this week might focus on stories about computing from different parts of the world.</li>
    <li>Students will read parts of <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=247" target="_blank">Chapter 7 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a>. The chapter goes in depth into the challenges of regulating the Internet. It explores different metaphors for the Internet and the ways that the government and courts have tried to use these metaphors in their decisions. These metaphors may provide interesting ways for you to get your students to think about the Internet. The chapter itself, as mentioned above, focuses much of its discussion on the regulation of pornographic content. This is because of our country's specific history and how it has dealt with First Amendment rights. Even without this focus, however, students can still consider issues of censorship, especially in ways that, for example, they might experience limits on what they are able to access in schools.</li>
  </ul>
</div>


<h3>Students will:</h3>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Think deeply about whether speech can be so harmful that it should be regulated.</li>
    <li>Consider the challenges of regulating Internet content.</li>
    <li>Consider their own views on censorship and learn about Internet censorship around the world.</li>
    <li>Think of why they should care about Internet censorship.</li>
    <li>Look into some information about how much of the world has access to the Internet and think about consequences of and ways to eliminate the digital divide.</li>
  </ul>

</div>


<h3>As a Class:</h3>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Page 1: Harmful speech.</strong>
      <ul>
	<li>Have students do the first two problems individually, and the third problem in groups of four.</li>
	<li>As a class, ask the groups of four to report suggestions that led to disagreement within the group. Write them down without discussion, then pick one or two for brief whole-class discussion.
	</li>
	<li>If you don't get enough controversial ones from the class, here are some you might suggest:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Insulting other students in social media as a joke. (If you call it &quot;cyber-bullying&quot; everyone will know they're supposed to be against it.)
	    </li>
	    <li>Advocating violence: &quot;What this country needs is an armed revolution.&quot;
	    </li>
	    <li>Edward Snowden revealing secret NSA spying on people's phone calls.
	    </li>
	    <li>&quot;Hot or not,&quot; a Web site where men could look at pictures of women and rate them as &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;not.&quot;
	    </li>
	    <li>Burning a US flag as a protest against the government.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Read out loud (or have a student read) the First Amendment, and make sure students get past the archaic language and understand what it's saying: the government can't stop you saying anything.
	</li>
	<li>If the remaining activities (about 15 minutes) won't fit into the remaining time in the class period, now is the time to break off the activity and come back to it in the next class meeting.
	</li>
	<li>Now have students read &quot;A Case Study,&quot; warning them that it contains language they probably won't like. If necessary, review the classroom expectations about calm discussion. Problem 4 asks them to discuss the case in small groups.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Important:</strong> The page deliberately doesn't include the resolution of the case, so as not to influence the students' discussion. But after the small group discussion, you should tell them that Brandenburg was convicted in Ohio, but his conviction was reversed by the US Supreme Court in 1969. The court's opinion said laws could prohibit &ldquo;advocacy ... directed to inciting or producing <u>imminent lawless action</u> and ... likely to incite or produce such action.&rdquo; The key word is &quot;imminent&quot;; you can say &quot;____ should be killed,&quot; but you can't say &quot;let's go kill some ____.&quot; Make sure students understand that the court wasn't <em>agreeing</em> with Brandenburg! Speech can be evil, and harmful, and still protected, because the founders felt that government control over speech was even more harmful. Mention the often-cited example of falsely shouting &quot;Fire&quot; in a crowded theater as an example of speech that fails the imminent harm test and is therefore not protected.
	</li>
	<li>Tell the students: &quot;You don't believe in freedom of speech unless you believe in freedom for speech that you hate.&quot;
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Page 2: Worldwide Censorship.</strong>
      <ul>
	<li>All of the discussions on this page are meant to be done in groups of four. This has two advantages; the obvious one is that everyone gets to talk, and the other is that small discussions are less likely to turn into shouting matches than large ones. But if time permits, when the class seems particularly interested in one of the questions, you can ask groups to report to the whole class what they decided.</li>
	<li>The page begins with the censorship of Nazi symbols and ideas in Germany, to pose the question of whether there's ever a good reason to censor political ideas.  (Germany is the most favorable example for such place-specific censorship we know about.)  The first two paragraphs set the context by explaining the Holocaust.  This will be tough reading.</li>                  
	<li>In particular, the second paragraph makes the point that <em>one</em> reason the Nazis were able to win a fair election (by plurality, not majority) was that many non-extremist Germans of the time shared the Nazis' antisemitism. The purpose of this point is not to suggest that modern Germans are bad people; it's an important reason why Germans themselves, after the war, felt (and still feel!) the need to censor Nazi ideas and symbols.</li>
	<li>The other major example on this page is China. That's the example everyone holds up as an obviously bad law.  Therefore, in the spirit of thinking deeply and critically, we look for reasons to support the Chinese government's positions:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Problem 5 is mainly about pornography, although the wording of the law is vague and it has been used against groups we would regard as political. But the point here is that pornography is (sometimes) illegal in the US, too.</li>
	    <li>Problem 6 is about cyberbullying.  Make sure kids realize that before moving on.</li>                                        
	    <li>Problem 7 is about hate speech, a category that has emerged fairly recently in the US as a <em>de facto</em> exception to the First Amendment.  That's still quite controversial in this country, but if you accept the idea of censorship at all, it seems progressive that China is against hate speech.</li>                    
	    <li>Problem 8 asks whether it's legal in the US to advocate the overthrow of the government.  The answer is yes, it is legal, most of the time. But in the McCarthy era it was <em>effectively</em> illegal; documents like the Constitution are effective only if the politicians follow it.</li>
	    <li>In problem 9, Cisco Systems, the largest manufacturer of routers, is a major supplier to China.  And of course the answer is yes, that's perfectly legal.</li>
	  </ul>
	  &nbsp;
	</li></ul></li>

	<li><strong>Page 3: Regulating the Internet.</strong>
          <ul>
	    <li>This is a fairly short page; it's marked Teacher's Choice not because of the timing but because it depends heavily on in-class reading of <em>Blown to Bits</em> (or a prior homework assignment), and that may be difficult in some classes.</li>
	    <li>The <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading is about a case that led to DOPA, which never actually became law. Students will probably relate to this law because they likely have experienced being blocked from certain web content in schools. Students are likely familiar with the idea that blocking content necessarily blocks not just harmful material, but also harmless and potentially useful information as well. Students also know that just because they cannot access certain content in schools does not mean that they are protected from this content completely.</li>
	    <li>The questions in problem 2 are meant to be guiding questions that students can use to make sure they understand what they are reading. A short whole-class discussion about these questions can be used to check that people understand the role of ISPs as described in the reading, and the complexities in assigning responsibility and regulating content.</li>
	    <li>The "Take It Further" reading is a short, interesting read that highlights that harm can come to completely innocent victims. Does this change how students think about whether people should be held responsible for their actions in spreading misinformation?</li>
	  </ul>
	  &nbsp;
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Page 4: Pornography.</strong>
          <ul>
	    <li>This is obviously a delicate topic, and that's why it's marked Teacher's Choice. But don't reject it out of hand; the problems given for discussion are meant to promote <em>calm</em> discussion. You might start by letting students know that you're relying on them to be mature, and also that the discussion is not going to examine pornographic materials.</li>
	    <li>The beginning of the page makes reference to the &quot;imminent action&quot; standard for government regulation of speech. The class should have learned about this from page 2, but it's not on the page itself; it's in this Teacher Guide page, as something you should read to the class as part of debriefing that page.</li>
	  </ul>
	  &nbsp;
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Page 5: Computing Around the World.</strong>
          <ul>
	    <li>Students will look at some country level statistics about Internet usage.</li>
	    <li>Discuss as a class what the different column headings measure, and why each column is useful in getting a more complete picture of who in the world has access to the Internet.</li>
	    <li>Spend some time with the third bullet point of problem 1, with students coming up with questions they have about Internet usage. You might even consider have students do some extra online research into some of their questions. Look for a variety of questions, such as:
	      <ul>
		<li>When was the Internet first introduced into these countries?</li>
		<li>What percent of people have a computer?</li>
		<li>Just because people have access to the Internet, does that mean they use it?</li>
		<li>How did these countries get to where they are? Are there different government policies? What are the differences in infrastructure?</li>
		<li>How much do people in different countries pay for Internet? Does the price vary a lot from country to country?</li>
		<li>and so on.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>Students can have a discussion or write about the digital divide. Be aware that some students do not have a computer or Internet access at home. The digital divide can create an unfair society, but there are ways of addressing this divide, such as providing free Internet and advocating for more access to technology in schools. Also consider how more technology is not strictly positive. What are ways that our society might be affected negatively by the prevalence of technology?</li>
	    <li>The "Take It Further" prompts offer some other perspectives about computing in the U.S. and around the world.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
  </ul>
    </li>
