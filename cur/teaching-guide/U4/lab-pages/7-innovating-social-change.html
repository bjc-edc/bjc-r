		<h2>Social Implications Lab 7: Innovating for Social Change</h2>
		<p>Students will soon be completing their AP Explore Task. Part of the purpose of this lab is to help them prepare for the task by exposing them to the range of prompts they will encounter. But the lab also has a larger purpose of giving students the meaningful experience of finding out how technology might address a social issue they care about. For the AP Explore Task, students may choose any technological innovation they wish, but for this lab, they will first identify personally relevant social issues to learn of ways technology has been used to make a difference.</p> 
		

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
			The 3 lab pages could be split across 3 to 5 days (150-250 minutes), depending on how long you wish to spend with students workshopping their writing. Expected times to complete follow:
			<ul>
				<li>30 minutes on Identifying Issues</li>
                <li>75-120 minutes on Address the Issue</li>
                <li>45-100 minutes on Unintended Consequences</li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<h3>Prepare:</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>You might consider having a student share a <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/openers.html#computingnews" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> story that is relevant to their topic. They might give a short presentation about their innovation using a current news story. News stories that show an unintended harmful consequence of an innovation can also spur discussion and give students ideas for exploring potential harmful effects of their chosen innovations.</li>
                <li>Many of the prompts come directly from the <a href="http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-performance-assessment.pdf" target="_blank">AP Explore Task</a>. Make sure you and your students are familiar with the requirements.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<h3>Students will:</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Choose a social issue to which they feel some personal connection.</li>
                <li>Research and write about an innovation related to this issue.</li>
                <li>Practice citing sources and answering prompts according to the AP Explore Task guidelines.</li>
			</ul>
		</div> 
			  
		
		<h3>As a Class:</h3>
		<div class="classIndent">
        
        <h4>Identifying Issues</h4>
        
        <ul>
        	<li>Students will use sentence starters to think about issues that they care about. Encourage students to think of issues which which they feel a personal connection. It doesn't have to be an issue that changes the world, but it should be an issue where they can see room for a technological innovation to produce a change.</li>
            <li>You might have students share their ideas in a whole-class discussion. Or you might choose just a few ideas from students and have the class together answer questions 2 and 3 about ways technology can and cannot address these issues.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Address the Issue</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>Students will choose one issue and one currently existing innovation they can research.</li>
            <li>Four prompts from the AP Explore Task are on this page. There are a variety of ways to have students develop their writing on these prompts:
            <ul>
            	<li>Have students practice outlining their responses to these prompts before they write the paragraphs. Have students pay special attention to whether they have responded to the prompt completely.</li>
                <li>Have students write their response, and then read their response verbatim to the class. There will likely be awkward sentences or phrases that don't make sense. Let students know that the point is not to make fun of their writing, but reading their response out loud can help them to improve the flow of their writing. Reading their work "out loud to themselves" is also a helpful tool as they proofread their writing.</li>
                <li>Have students share paragraphs in small groups of students who can give them feedback. The feedback can focus on making sure their response is complete and answers the prompt that is asked.</li>
                <li>Share students' work (anonymous or not, depending on the class) at the front of the room. Have people talk about what is strong about the response already and what could make the response even stronger. Model this process for students as well.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Unintended Consequences</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li>Problem 4 is another AP Explore Task prompt that asks about beneficial and harmful effects of the innovation. This page in the lab is designed to help students think about potential harmful effects of an innovation before they write their response.</li>
            <li>Consider using the strategies listed above to improve students' responses to the prompt in problem 4.</li>
            <li>The first "Take It Further" prompt is an official part of the AP Explore Task. You should talk about this part of the task with your students, even if you don't have time to do practice this before the official task. Note that this visual artifact is specifically about one beneficial or harmful effect of the innovation.</li>
            <li>Problem B in the "Take It Further" is a chance for students to be creative. They will have other opportunities to do this later in the year, but, after researching someone else's innovation, this is a good opportunity to get students to think of their own ideas. Have them think not only about the benefits of their innovation but also the potential harmful effects.</li>
        </ul>
