                                <li>Most students will greatly enjoy encoding and decoding secret messages.  Make sure that there is enough time planned in the lesson for this hands-on activity.</li>
                                <li>It may be a good idea to suggest that for starters students try to encode/decode very short messages.</li>
                                <li>Some students may get frustrated in the decoding process, not being able to crack their partner's code, even for short messages.  Tell them that the challenging nature of decoding is to be expected and is actually one of the main take aways of this activity.</li>
                                <li>Some students may find the ciphers discussed here too abstract.  Let them encode/decode a simple message using the example ciphers given to gain some hands-on experience.</li>
                                <li>Take some time to discuss the weaknesses of these ciphers and how they may be broken.  Invite suggestions on how to improve on the security of such systems of cryptography.</li>

                            <strong>Tips:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Students may find it hard to wrap their heads around the use of modular arithmetic in public key cryptography. But that part of the algorithm is important only because the numbers involved get to be very large, and remainders (modular arithmetic) are used just so that the numbers fit in a computer word. The essential idea isn't that hard: <em>If you find two very large prime numbers and multiply them together, you get an even larger product, and it takes a long time to figure out the two primes if all you know is their product. The product is the public key; the two primes are the private key.</em> But students don't have to understand even that much; <em>if students understand the metaphor of mixing colors described in the video, that's  good enough</em>.</li>
                                <li>It may seem nonintuitive that open standards <em>help</em> with Internet security. If you want to keep something a secret, shouldn't the method of keeping it secret be kept secret too? The answer is no, but this takes some thinking out. The reason is that complicated algorithms may have hidden bugs, so by <em>publishing</em> the algorithm openly, you invite everyone in the world to look for bugs.</li>
                                <li>Why do we need Certificate Authorities? If you want to send a secure message to a personal friend, you can physically meet your friend or talk on the phone to exchange public keys. But if you want to send a secure message to a big institution (like your bank, Amazon, or Google), how do you know their public key? You can look on their web site, but until you've exchanged public keys, you can't be sure that what your browser shows you really <em>is</em> their web site. This is why we need Certificate Authorities. The public keys from Certificate Authorities are hardwired into your browser. Nevertheless, CAs have been compromised or spoofed; this is one of the weak links in Internet security. (The Wikipedia article on CA attacks is fairly readable if a student wants to study this question further.)</li>
