		<h2>Programming Lab 5: Internet Security</h2>
		<p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)&mdash;and the Internet Society that oversees the IETF&mdash;oversee the Internet protocols, and the US Department of Commerce controls the DNS hierarchy (the domain namespace and the allocation of IP addresses). Students learn about the history and impact of these organizations controlling the communication standards and addressing systems for the Internet.</p> 
		

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
			The 3 lab pages could be split across X or X days (X-X minutes). Expected times to complete follow:
			<ul>
				<li>20-30 minutes (&lt;1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/5-internet-security/1-ietf.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Who's In Charge of the Internet?
</a></li>
				<li>X-X minutes (X class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/5-internet-security/2-security.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Cybersecurity</a></li>

            <h3>Heartbleed Bug!</h3>
            <p>About one year ago, a bug of incredible magnitude was uncovered.  It was an incredibly serious security hole (aka vulnerability) in OpenSSL, which provides security and privacy for the Internet (web, email, IM, VPNs, etc).  </p>
