		<h2>Lab 5: Secure Communication</h2>
		<p>Students learn about various cybersecurity risks on the Internet (including the fundamental lack of DNS security and common security attacks) and the basic concepts of cryptography.</p> 

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
			The 2 lab pages could be split across 1 or 2 days (<strong>50-80 minutes</strong>). Expected times to complete follow:
		  <ul>
				<li>10-20 minutes (&lt;1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/5-secure-communication/8-cybersecurity.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Cybersecurity</a></li>
				<li>40-60 minutes (about 1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/5-secure-communication/7-cryptography.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Cryptography

            <h3>Heartbleed Bug!</h3>
            <p>About one year ago, a bug of incredible magnitude was uncovered.  It was an incredibly serious security hole (aka vulnerability) in OpenSSL, which provides security and privacy for the Internet (web, email, IM, VPNs, etc).  </p>
