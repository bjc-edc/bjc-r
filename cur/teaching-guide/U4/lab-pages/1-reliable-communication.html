		<h2>Lab 1: Reliable Communication</h2>
		<p>This lab offers an introduction to the Internet that covers the difference between the World Wide Web and the Internet, URLs, network redundancy, and domain name hierarchy. Optional pages include information on the history of the Internet and a very brief introduction to HTML.</p>

                                    After students have worked through the questions on the lab page, you could use these questions for a group discussion:
									<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/redundant-2.jpg" alt="network redundancy" title="network redundancy" />
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Are there any other two nodes whose failure would stop the message from going through? Either the two neighbor nodes of the receiver could fail or the right neighbor node of the receiver and the node <em>above</em> the left neighbor node of the receiver could fail.</li>
                                        <li>What is the minimum number of extra connections you'd have to add so that <em>any</em> two nodes could fail without preventing messages between any two other nodes? The answer is two. There are four vertices with only two neighbors; use one edge to connect any two of those, and another to connect the other two. (This will require "crossing" connections on the graph as it is drawn here, but this is OK and could offer an opportunity to remind students of what the elements of the graph represent.)</li>
                                        <li>What is the <em>minimum</em> number of nodes that can stop working before the sender and the receiver can't communicate? One way to answer this question is to note that the receiver has only two neighbors, so if those two nodes go down, it can't get any messages no matter where the sender is in the network. (The same argument applies to the sender, but since the sender has three neighbors and 3&gt;2, it's the receiver that provides the answer to this question.)</li>
                                        <li>What is the <em>maximum</em> number of nodes that can fail and still let Sender and Receiver communicate? To answer this question, you can find the shortest path between the desired endpoints (which is the one through the two highly-connected central nodes) and then let all the other nodes fail.</li>
                                    </ul>
