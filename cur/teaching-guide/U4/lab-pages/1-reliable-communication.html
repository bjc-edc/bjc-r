		<h2>Lab 1: Computer Networks</h2>
        <p>This lab offers a very brief overview of what could be (and often is, in college-level CS) a full course in itself: how the Internet works. It emphasizes a few key ideas:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>The Internet is a huge artifact, built and maintained by thousands of people around the world, based on a level of cooperation that's remarkable, considering that it connects enemy countries and competing corporations.</li>
        	<li>The design of the network has to be very different from the kind of programming students have done in this course, because in such a large system you have to assume that some network software or (more likely) equipment will fail in the middle of a transaction. So the network needs a lot of redundancy, and software (mostly running in routers) has to manage the redundant parts.</li>
        	<li>The complexity of the network is such that abstraction is an absolute requirement, not just a good idea in general. The multiple levels of abstraction are provided by <em>protocols:</em> design specifications for software in terms of the services it can expect from lower levels of abstraction and the services it must provide to higher levels. There are four main levels of abstraction:
            <ul>
            	<li>Application layer: User-visible software such as browsers and email. Assumes a reliable Internet.</li>
            	<li>Transport layer: Provides the abstraction of a reliable Internet. The main protocol at this level is TCP: Transmission Control Protocol. Assumes a world-wide addressable Internet.</li>
            	<li>Internet layer: Provides the abstraction of a world-wide Internet. The main protocol at this level is IP: Internet Protocol.  This runs mainly in routers, not in users' computers. Assumes connection to a local network and one or more larger networks.</li>
            	<li>Link layer: Provides hardware connection to a network. Ethernet, WiFi, and cellular data are the main examples.</li>
           	  </ul>
       	  </li>
        	<li>The running of the Internet takes a lot of work, and involves a lot of international politics. &quot;Who's in charge?&quot; is not a simple question.</li>
        </ul>
     <p>In addition to these main points, there's a lot of vocabulary the College Board expects students to learn.  We try to present the vocabulary a little at a time, in contexts in which each term makes sense.

                                    After students have worked through the questions on the lab page, you could use these questions for a group discussion:
									<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/redundant-2.jpg" alt="A network with the sender connected to the receiver via a multitude of nodes and routes demonstrating network redundancy" title="A network with the sender connected to the receiver via a multitude of nodes and routes demonstrating network redundancy" />
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Are there any other two nodes whose failure would stop the message from going through? Either the two neighbor nodes of the receiver could fail or the right neighbor node of the receiver and the node <em>above</em> the left neighbor node of the receiver could fail.</li>
                                        <li>What is the minimum number of extra connections you'd have to add so that <em>any</em> two nodes could fail without preventing messages between any two other nodes? The answer is two. There are four vertices with only two neighbors; use one edge to connect any two of those, and another to connect the other two. (This will require "crossing" connections on the graph as it is drawn here, but this is OK and could offer an opportunity to remind students of what the elements of the graph represent.)</li>
                                        <li>What is the <em>minimum</em> number of nodes that can stop working before the sender and the receiver can't communicate? One way to answer this question is to note that the receiver has only two neighbors, so if those two nodes go down, it can't get any messages no matter where the sender is in the network. (The same argument applies to the sender, but since the sender has three neighbors and 3 &gt; 2, it's the receiver that provides the answer to this question.)</li>
                                        <li>What is the <em>maximum</em> number of nodes that can fail and still let Sender and Receiver communicate? To answer this question, you can find the shortest path between the desired endpoints (which is the one through the two highly-connected central nodes) and then let all the other nodes fail.</li>
                                    </ul>

						<li><strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
						  <ul>
						    <li>Understand the four layers of abstraction in the Internet protocols.</li>
						    <li>Understand how TCP/IP together provide the main abstractions for the net.</li>
						    <li>Understand how your home router can send a message to any IP address.</li>
					      </ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Tips:</strong>
						  <ul>
						    <li> The Wikipedia article &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite" target="_blank">Internet Protocol Suite</a>&quot; has a chart showing just a few of the 300-odd protocols that run the Internet. You might let interested kids read up on some obscure protocol and explain to the class what it does and why it's important.</li>
						    <li>The specific implementation of  TCP/IP most commonly used around the world was developed at UC Berkeley. :-)</li>
						    <li>It's easy to give a one-sentence description of a protocol, but, for example, early implementations of TCP worked in theory but could easily become swamped with backed up traffic; the current protocol description includes complicated timing mechanisms that are essential to keeping the net flowing smoothly.</li>
