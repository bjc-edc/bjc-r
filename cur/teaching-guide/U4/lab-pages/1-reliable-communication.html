  <h2>Lab 1: Computer Networks</h2>
  <div class="todo">KEEP SUCH THAT needs to be fixed. --MF, 6/22/20</div>
  <p>This lab offers a very brief overview of what could be (and often is, in college-level CS) a full course in
    itself: how the Internet works. It emphasizes a few key ideas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Internet is a huge artifact, built and maintained by thousands of people around the world, based on a
      level of cooperation that's remarkable, considering that it connects enemy countries and competing
      corporations.</li>
    <li>The design of the network has to be very different from the kind of programming students have done in this
      course, because in such a large system you have to assume that some network software or (more likely)
      equipment will fail in the middle of a transaction. So the network needs a lot of redundancy, and software
      (mostly running in routers) has to manage the redundant parts.</li>
    <li>
      The complexity of the network is such that abstraction is an absolute requirement, not just a good idea in
      general. The multiple levels of abstraction are provided by <em>protocols:</em> design specifications for
      software in terms of the services it can expect from lower levels of abstraction and the services it must
      provide to higher levels. There are four main levels of abstraction:
      <ul>
        <li>Application layer: User-visible software such as browsers and email. Assumes a reliable Internet.
        </li>
        <li>Transport layer: Provides the abstraction of a reliable Internet. The main protocol at this level is
          TCP: Transmission Control Protocol. Assumes a world-wide addressable Internet.</li>
        <li>Internet layer: Provides the abstraction of a world-wide Internet. The main protocol at this level
          is IP: Internet Protocol. This runs mainly in routers, not in users' computers. Assumes connection
          to a local network and one or more larger networks.</li>
        <li>Link layer: Provides hardware connection to a network. Ethernet, WiFi, and cellular data are the
          main examples.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The running of the Internet takes a lot of work, and involves a lot of international politics. &quot;Who's
      in charge?&quot; is not a simple question.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to these main points, there's a lot of vocabulary the College Board expects students to learn. We try
    to present the vocabulary a little at a time, in contexts in which each term makes sense.</p>

              <li>
                After students have worked through the questions on the lab page, you could use these
                questions for a group discussion:
                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/redundant-2.jpg"
                  alt="A network with the sender connected to the receiver via a multitude of nodes and routes demonstrating network redundancy"
                  title="A network with the sender connected to the receiver via a multitude of nodes and routes demonstrating network redundancy" />
                <ul>
                  <li>Are there any other two nodes whose failure would stop the message from going
                    through? Either the two neighbor nodes of the receiver could fail or the right
                    neighbor node of the receiver and the node <em>above</em> the left neighbor node
                    of the receiver could fail.</li>
                  <li>What is the minimum number of extra connections you'd have to add so that
                    <em>any</em> two nodes could fail without preventing messages between any two
                    other nodes? The answer is two. There are four vertices with only two neighbors;
                    use one edge to connect any two of those, and another to connect the other two.
                    (This will require "crossing" connections on the graph as it is drawn here, but
                    this is OK and could offer an opportunity to remind students of what the
                    elements of the graph represent.)</li>
                  <li>What is the <em>minimum</em> number of nodes that can stop working before the
                    sender and the receiver can't communicate? One way to answer this question is to
                    note that the receiver has only two neighbors, so if those two nodes go down, it
                    can't get any messages no matter where the sender is in the network. (The same
                    argument applies to the sender, but since the sender has three neighbors and 3
                    &gt; 2, it's the receiver that provides the answer to this question.)</li>
                  <li>What is the <em>maximum</em> number of nodes that can fail and still let Sender
                    and Receiver communicate? To answer this question, you can find the shortest
                    path between the desired endpoints (which is the one through the two
                    highly-connected central nodes) and then let all the other nodes fail.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="comment">This is new. I pulled it off the bottom of the student page and
                  dumped it here. --MF, 11/18/19</div>
              </li>
              <li>The last question on this student page poses several questions. Here are some possible
                correct responses:
                <ul>
                  <li>The benefit of fault tolerance is that if some piece of the system fails, the
                    whole system doesn't fail.</li>
                  <li>The Internet is fault tolerance because is has redundant connections.</li>
                  <li>The vulnerabilities to failure include damage to a cable, power failure,
                    military intervention, hardware malfunction, etc.</li>
                </ul>

              <li>The Wikipedia article &quot;<a

                  target="_blank">Internet Protocol Suite</a>&quot; has a chart showing just a few of
                the 300-odd protocols that run the Internet. You might let interested kids read up on
                some obscure protocol and explain to the class what it does and why it's important.</li>
              <li>The specific implementation of TCP/IP most commonly used around the world was developed
                at UC Berkeley. :-)</li>
              <li>It's easy to give a one-sentence description of a protocol, but, for example, early
                implementations of TCP worked in theory but could easily become swamped with backed up
                traffic; the current protocol description includes complicated timing mechanisms that
                are essential to keeping the net flowing smoothly.</li>

        capable of sending or receiving data.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.A.4:</strong> A computer network is a type of a computing system.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.A.5:</strong> A <em>path</em> between two computing devices on a computer network (a
        sender and a receiver) is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender
        and ends at the receiver.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.A.6:</strong> <em>Routing</em> is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver.
      </li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.A.7:</strong> The <em>bandwidth</em> of a computer network is the maximum amount of data
        that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.A.8:</strong> Bandwidth is usually measured in bits per second.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.B.1:</strong> The Internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks
        that use standardized, open (nonproprietary) communication protocols.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.B.2:</strong> Access to the Internet depends on the ability to connect a computing device
        to an Internet-connected device.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.B.3:</strong> A <em>protocol</em> is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior
        of a system.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.B.4:</strong> The protocols used in the Internet are <em>open</em>, which allows users to
        easily connect additional computing devices to the Internet.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.B.5:</strong> Routing on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance.
      </li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.B.6:</strong> The <em>scalability</em> of a system is the capacity for the system to
        change in size and scale to meet new demands.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.B.7:</strong> The Internet was designed to be scalable.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.C.1:</strong> Information is passed through the Internet as a <em>data stream</em>. Data
        streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in <em>packets</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.C.2:</strong> Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet
        between the origin and the destination on the Internet, as well as for data reassembly.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.C.3:</strong> Packets may arrive at the destination in order, out of order, or not at all.
      </li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.C-4:</strong> IP, TCP, and UDP are common protocols used on the Internet.</li>

      <li><strong>CSN-1.E.1:</strong> The Internet has been engineered to be fault-tolerant, with abstractions for
        routing and transmitting data.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.E.2:</strong> <em>Redundancy</em> is the inclusion of extra components that can be used to
        mitigate failure of a system if other components fail.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.E.3:</strong> One way to accomplish network redundancy is by having more than one path
        between any two connected devices.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.E.4:</strong> If a particular device or connection on the Internet fails, subsequent data
        will be sent via a different route, if possible.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.E.5:</strong> When a system can support failures and still continue to function, it is
        called <em>fault-tolerant</em>. This is important because elements of complex systems fail at unexpected
        times, often in groups, and fault tolerance allows users to continue to use the network.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.E.6:</strong> Redundancy within a system often requires additional resources but can
        provide the benefit of fault tolerance.</li>
      <li><strong>CSN-1.E.7:</strong> The redundancy of routing options between two points increases the
        reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>IOC-1.B.1:</strong> Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not
        originally intended:
        <ul>
          <li>The World Wide Web was originally intended only for rapid and easy exchange of information
            within the scientific community.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
