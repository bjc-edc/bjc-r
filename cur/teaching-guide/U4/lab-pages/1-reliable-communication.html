		<h2>Lab 1: Reliable Communication</h2>
		<p>This lab offers an introduction to the Internet that covers the difference between the World Wide Web and the Internet, URLs, network redundancy, and domain name hierarchy. Optional pages include information on the history of the Internet and a very brief introduction to HTML.</p>

                                    After students have worked through the questions on the lab page, you could use these questions for a group discussion:
									<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/redundant-2.jpg" alt="A network with the sender connected to the receiver via a multitude of nodes and routes demonstrating network redundancy" title="A network with the sender connected to the receiver via a multitude of nodes and routes demonstrating network redundancy" />
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Are there any other two nodes whose failure would stop the message from going through? Either the two neighbor nodes of the receiver could fail or the right neighbor node of the receiver and the node <em>above</em> the left neighbor node of the receiver could fail.</li>
                                        <li>What is the minimum number of extra connections you'd have to add so that <em>any</em> two nodes could fail without preventing messages between any two other nodes? The answer is two. There are four vertices with only two neighbors; use one edge to connect any two of those, and another to connect the other two. (This will require "crossing" connections on the graph as it is drawn here, but this is OK and could offer an opportunity to remind students of what the elements of the graph represent.)</li>
                                        <li>What is the <em>minimum</em> number of nodes that can stop working before the sender and the receiver can't communicate? One way to answer this question is to note that the receiver has only two neighbors, so if those two nodes go down, it can't get any messages no matter where the sender is in the network. (The same argument applies to the sender, but since the sender has three neighbors and 3 &gt; 2, it's the receiver that provides the answer to this question.)</li>
                                        <li>What is the <em>maximum</em> number of nodes that can fail and still let Sender and Receiver communicate? To answer this question, you can find the shortest path between the desired endpoints (which is the one through the two highly-connected central nodes) and then let all the other nodes fail.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

							<strong>Tips:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>In exercise 2, there are two student-chosen alternatives to support different learning styles. Exercise (a) is broad, so a wide range of levels of detail can be considered correct. But for the same reason, some students may not know where to start. Exercise (b) has a very specific answer: <em>when you specify an IP address, you are not specifying the exact path that's taken; you are only specifying the endpoint. That's an abstraction because the Internet can't get your message to the endpoint without building a path from sender to receiver.</em> Students who have trouble with abstraction may find it a harder question.</li>

			<h4>Enduring Understandings:</h4>
            <p>Students learn about the structures and abstractions of the Internet and the systems built on it (<strong>EU 6.1</strong> and <strong>EU 6.2</strong>).

                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2B</strong> The redundancy of routing (i.e., more than one way to route data) between two points on the Internet increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.</li>

                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2F</strong> The Internet is a packet-switched system through which digital data is sent by breaking the data into blocks of bits called packets, which contain both the data being transmitted and control information for routing the data.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2G</strong> Standards for packets and routing include transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP).</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2I</strong> The size and speed of systems affect their use.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2J</strong> The bandwidth of a system is a measure of bit rate&mdash;the amount of data (measured in bits) that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.</li>
                <li><strong>EK 6.2.2K</strong> The latency of a system is the time elapsed between the transmission and the receipt of a request.</li>
