		<h2>Programming Lab 3: Number Representation</h2>
		<p>This lab is meant to address the requirements of AP CSP LO 2.1.2, "Explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data." (But it does not cover <em>hardware</em> abstraction levels.)</p>
		<p>The first page introduces binary representation as a place value system just like decimal representation, but with base 2 instead of 10.</p>
		<p>The second page explains that a sequence of bits can represent things other than binary integers, and in particular explains floating point notation for real numbers.</p> 
		<p>The last page addresses hexadecimal (base 16), building on students' understanding of binary to support IPv6 addresses and RGB colors used in HTML/CSS. </p>

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
			The 3 lab pages could be split across 2 or 3 days (105-130 minutes). Expected times to complete follow:
			<ul>
                <li>
                	15-20 minutes (&lt;1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-number-representation/1-binary.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Binary Representation</a>
                	<ul><li>This lab page was originally included in Unit 1. If your students covered it there, you can skip it here.</li></ul>
                </li>
				<li>45-55 minutes (1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-number-representation/2-binary-sequences.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Binary Sequences</a></li>
                <li>45-55 minutes (1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-number-representation/3-hexadecimal.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Hexadecimal Representation</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<h3>Prepare:</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>There's no such thing as a "binary <em>number</em>" or a "hexadecimal <em>number</em>." </strong>Numbers are the underlying idea of counts of things. If I hold 17 pencils in my hand and I then decide to think in hexadecimal and say I have 11<sub>16</sub> pencils, that doesn't make some pencils magically disappear from my hand. I still have 17 of them. Instead, we speak of "binary <em>numerals</em>" or "binary <em>representation</em>." Many curriculum materials get this wrong. It's not just pedantry; students will really understand the conversions better if they don't have the misunderstanding that the <em>number</em> changes. The analogy with Roman numerals may be helpful; students are likely to understand and be able extend from the idea that MCMLXII and 1962 are the same number written in different representations.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<h3>Students will:</h3>
		<div class="sidenoteBig">
			<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
			<ul>
            	<li>Students will create decimal-to-binary and binary-to-decimal converter blocks in <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/7-recursive-reporters.topic" target="_blank">Unit 6, Recursive Reporters</a>.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<ul>
                <li>Extend their understanding of different number bases to include binary and hexadecimal.</li>
                <li>Develop a beginning understanding of floating point.</li>
                <li>Explore hexadecimal representation and its use in RGB color and IP addresses.</li></ul></div> 
			  
		
		<h3>As a Class:</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
                <li>
                	<strong>Page 2: Binary Sequences.</strong>
                    <ul>
						<li>Encourage students to take turns reading on this page.</li>
                    </ul>
				</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Page 3: Hexadecimal Representation.</strong>
                    <ul>
						<li>Don't try to teach students to do hexadecimal <em>arithmetic</em>.  The goal is for students to become <em>familiar with the notation</em> of hex. Consider translating between representations for a few numbers together at the board.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
            </ul>

                    Students do not need to become proficient in conversion between representations, but some students may like to play one or more of the following number representation games. Offer them at your discretion, but watch that they do not become a distraction  from the essential content of the unit.

		<h3>Tips:</h3>
		<div>
        	<ul>
            	<li><strong>Page 1: Binary Representation.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>In addition to making the comparison between powers of two and powers of ten for the place values, this page pushes on the fact that there is a <em>unique</em> way to represent any positive integer as a sum of powers of two.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Page 2: Binary Sequences.</strong>
					<ul>
                        <!--<li>We want to make range limitations in computer arithmetic something that students can explore experimentally, so we start by having them write a factorial procedure, because that's a function that grows very quickly, so even for small inputs they can see the results of range limitations.</li>
                        <li>But we also want to emphasize that allowing human beings to see hardware limitations is a gross failure of abstraction, and that a good programming language doesn't allow that to happen. As the page explains, <em>people have died</em> because of integer overflow. Thus, for pedagogic purposes, Snap<em>!</em> can simulate both bad and good languages.</li>-->
                        <li>We explain that other data types, including lists, are represented as binary sequences, but we do <em>not</em> introduce the idea of pointers to memory addresses.</li>
					</ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Page 3: Hexadecimal Representation.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don't overemphasize number representations.  This is a popular topic because it's easy, but it doesn't call for deep understanding; hex is just a notation that people find convenient in a few computing contexts.  (<em>Very</em> few, actually; RGB and IPv6 pretty much exhaust them.)</li>
                        <li>Although base 16 is a base in its own right, it's <em>important</em> only as an abbreviation for the underlying binary. You don't necessarily have to say that to students, but don't allow a mystique to develop around hex.</li>
                        <li> Remind students that the purpose of computer science is to <em>abstract away</em> the details. That's why "orange" (which browsers <em>also</em> understand) is a much better representation for that color than "FF7F00."</li>
