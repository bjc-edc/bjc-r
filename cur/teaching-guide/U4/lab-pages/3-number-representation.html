		<h2>Programming Lab 3: Number Representation</h2>
		<p>binary numerals, </p> 
		<p>The last page addresses hexadecimal (base 16), building on students' understanding of binary from <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 1</a> to support IPv6 addresses and RGB colors used in HTML/CSS. </p>

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
			The 3 lab pages could be split across X or X days (X-X minutes). Expected times to complete follow:
			<ul>
                <li>15-20 minutes (&lt;1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-number-representation/1-binary.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Binary Representation</a></li>
				<li>X-X minutes () on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-number-representation/2-binary-sequences.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Binary Sequences</a></li>
                <li>45-55 minutes (1 class period) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-number-representation/3-hexadecimal.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Hexadecimal Representation</a></li>

			<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
			<ul>
            	<li>Students will create decimal-to-binary and binary-to-decimal converter blocks in <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/7-recursive-reporters.topic" target="_blank">Unit 6, Recursive Reporters</a>.</li>
                <li></li>
				<li>Extend their understanding of different number bases to include hexadecimal.</li>
                <li>Explore hexadecimal representation and its use in RGB color and IP addresses.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<ul>
                <li>Broaden and refine their understanding of the mathematics of computer science including binary and hexadecimal number representation.</li>

		<h3>As a Class:</h3>
		<div>
            <ul>
				<li>
                	<strong>Page 3: Hexadecimal Representation.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Encourage students to take turns reading on this page.</li>
                        <li>Don't try to teach kids to do hexadecimal arithmetic.  The goal is for students to become <em>familiar with the notation</em> of hex. Consider translating between  representations for a few numbers together at the board.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    For page 3, Hexadecimal Representation, you may wish to offer one or more of the following number representation games. At your discretion, use them as homework, for a shorter class period, or for a day before vacation. In the classroom, watch that these do not distract students from the essential content of the unit.

                        <li><a href="http://forums.cisco.com/CertCom/game/binary_game_page.htm" target="_blank">Cisco Binary Game</a>: a base 10 to base 2 board-clearing game. This game could help to review base 2 (from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-number-representation/1-binary.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 1</a>), though it does have an element of time pressure and might take few minutes to figure out. The instructions are not perfect but helpful.</li>

This game has no time pressure, so it might be the most accessible of the three. Also, the first ten matches (<span class="katex">0_{16}-9_{16}</span>) are easier because they are like converting between base 10 and base 2.</li>
						<li><a href="http://flippybitandtheattackofthehexadecimalsfrombase16.com/" target="_blank">Flippy Bit And The Attack Of The Hexadecimals From Base 16</a>: a base 2 to base 16 arcade-style shooter.

		<h3>Tips:</h3>
		<div>
        	<ul>
            	<li>
                	<strong>Page 3: Hexadecimal Representation.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don't overemphasize number representations.  This is a popular topic because it's easy, but it doesn't call for deep understanding; hex is just a notation that people find convenient in a few computing contexts.  (<em>Very</em> few, actually; RGB and IPv6 pretty much exhaust them.)</li>
                        <li>Although base 16 is a base in its own right, like base 7 or base 10, it's <em>important</em> only as an abbreviation for the underlying binary. You don't necessarily have to say that to students, but don't allow a mystique to develop around hex; it's bad enough that everyone is so fascinated with binary.</li>
                        <li> Remind students, if necessary, that the purpose of computer science is to abstract away the grubby details. That's why &quot;orange&quot; (which browsers also understand) is a much better representation for that color than &quot;FF7F00.&quot;</li>
