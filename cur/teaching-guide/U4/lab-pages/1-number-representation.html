		<h2>Lab 1: Number Representation</h2>
		<div class="sidenote">In the 2017-2018 version of BJC, this lab will likely be moved to a unit focused on how computers work (covering AP CSP Learning Objectives 1.3.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.2.3, 3.3.1, 4.1.2, 5.2.1, 5.5.1, 7.2.1). This lab has been included in the 2016-2017 update to Unit 4 to maintain consistency of standards coverage with the rest of the 2016-2017 version of the curriculum.</div>
        <p>This lab addreses the requirements of AP CSP Enduring Understanding 2.1.2, "Explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data." (It does not cover <em>hardware</em> abstraction levels.)</p>
		<p>The first page introduces binary representation as a place value system just like decimal representation, but with only two digits (0 and 1) instead of ten (0 through 9).</p>
        <p>The second page explains how a sequence of bits can represent information other than  integers, and in particular explains <strong>floating point</strong> as an approximation for real numbers.</p> 
		<p>The third page addresses hexadecimal representation, which uses sixteen digits (0-9 and A-F), building on students' understanding of binary. Students also learn to translate between hex and binary and about the ue of hex in RGB colors.</p>

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
			The 4 lab pages could be split across X or X days (<strong>X-X minutes</strong>). Expected times to complete follow:
			<ul>
                <li>
                	30-60 minutes (1-2 class periods) on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-number-representation/1-binary.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc_2015-2016.html&novideo&noassignment">Binary Representation</a>

		<h3>Prepare:</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>There's no such thing as a "binary <em>number</em>" or a "hexadecimal <em>number</em>." </strong> The way we represent a number—as XXXI<sub>Roman</sub> or 31<sub>10</sub> or 11111<sub>2</sub> or 1F<sub>16</sub> or "thirty-one" or "treinta y uno"—is language or notation. The <em>number</em>, itself, is the same, regardless of what language we express it in. It helps the distinction to say "binary <em>numerals</em>" or "binary <em>representation</em>" instead of "binary numbers." Some curriculum materials are less careful. It's not just pedantry; students  understand the conversions better when they remain clearly aware that only the notation, not the <em>number,</em> changes. Explicitly making the analogy with Roman numerals may help; students are likely to understand and be able to extend from the idea XXXI and 31 are the same number written different ways.</li>
				<li>&quot;Hexadecimal&quot; is often abbreviated just to &quot;hex.&quot; Either is fine to use generally, but students should recognize both.</li>
			</ul>
        </div>


		<h3>Students will:</h3>

            	<li>Students will create decimal-to-binary and binary-to-decimal converter blocks in <a href="/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=nyc_bjc/7-recursive-reporters.topic" target="_blank">Unit 6, Recursive Reporters</a>.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
                <li>Extend their understanding of number representations to include binary and hexadecimal.</li>

                    Students do not need to become proficient at converting among representations—not for the AP, not for careers in programming, not for anything—but some students find these notational changes interesting and may <em>like</em>  to play one or more of the following number representation games <em>on their own time</em>.

			<h4>Enduring Understandings:</h4>
            <ul>
            	<li><strong>2.1</strong> A variety of abstractions built upon binary sequences can be used to represent all digital data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
            <ul>
            	<li><strong>2.1.1</strong> Describe the variety of abstractions used to represent data. [P3]</li>
                <li><strong>2.1.2</strong> Explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data. [P5]</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Essential Knowledge:</h4>
			<ul>
            	<li><strong>2.1.1A</strong> Digital data is represented by abstractions at different levels.</li>
                <li><strong>2.1.1B</strong> At the lowest level, all digital data are represented by bits.</li>
                <li><strong>2.1.1C</strong> At a higher level, bits are grouped to represent abstractions, including but not limited to numbers, characters, and color.</li>
                <li><strong>2.1.1D</strong> Number bases, including binary, decimal, and hexadecimal, are used to represent and investigate digital data.</li>
                <li><strong>2.1.1E</strong> At one of the lowest levels of abstraction, digital data is represented in binary (base 2) using only combinations of the digits zero and one.</li>
                <li><strong>2.1.1F</strong> Hexadecimal (base 16) is used to represent digital data because hexadecimal representation uses fewer digits than binary.</li>
                <li><strong>2.1.1G</strong> Numbers can be converted from any base to any other base.</li>
                <li><strong>2.1.2A</strong> A finite representation is used to model the infinite mathematical concept of a number. </li>
                <li><strong>2.1.2B</strong> In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent characters or integers limits the range of integer values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in overflow or other errors. Exclusion Statement (2.1.2B): Range limitations of any one language, compiler, or architecture are beyond the scope of this course and the AP Exam.</li>
                <li><strong>2.1.2C</strong> In many programming languages, the fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers (as floating point numbers) limits the range of floating point values and mathematical operations; this limitation can result in round</li>
                <li><strong>2.1.2D</strong> The interpretation of a binary sequence depends on how it is used.</li>
                <li><strong>2.1.2E</strong> A sequence of bits may represent instructions or data.</li>
                <li><strong>2.1.2F</strong> A sequence of bits may represent different types of data in different contexts.</li>
                <li><strong>6.2.2J</strong> The bandwidth of a system is a measure of bit rate —the amount of data (measured in bits) that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.</li>
                <li><strong>6.2.2K</strong> The latency of a system is the time elapsed between the transmission and the receipt of a request.</li>
