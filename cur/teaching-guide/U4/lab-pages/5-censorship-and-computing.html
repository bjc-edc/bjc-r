		<h2>Social Implications Lab 5: Censorship and Computing around the World</h2>
		<p>This lab takes the broad structure and content of <em>Blown to Bits</em> Chapter 7. Students first consider what rules (if any) ought to exist on the Internet and then learn of some of the practical difficulties of regulating Internet content. This is also an opportunity for students to think further about their own role as digital citizens. Students then consider some issues of free speech and are confronted with the fact that a global Internet leads to issues when different countries have different standards for what should be censored. Finally, students take this opportunity to examine some statistics for Internet use around the world.</p> 
        <p>Beware that many potential sensitive topics are addressed on these pages.
        <ul>
        	<li>The first story in the <em>Blown to Bits</em> reading is about a romantic connection online. While dramatic, this particular story did not have a devastating end, but it is possible that students may have experienced stalking or worse online.</li>
            <li>Chapter 7 in <em>Blown to Bits</em> examines censorship primarily in terms of how pornographic materials are treated online. The students are not assigned reading from most of these sections, but students may read these sections and have questions or raise issues.</li>
            <li>In materials about Internet censorship, specific countries are identified as having particularly harsh censorship policies. The United States is not immune from this, but be aware of statements that are made that appear to judge people of other nationalities. Part of the point of thinking through the social implications of these issues is to realize that these issues are not simple, and that different policies reflect different ways that societies have grappled with difficult and complex issues.</li>
            <li>Finally, students will discuss the "digital divide" at the end of this Lab. Be aware of students who themselves do not have a computer at home. There are policies and innovations that are being developed to eliminate this digital divide, and it is an issue that all students can work to address.</li>
            </ul></p>
        		

		<h3>Pacing:</h3>
		<div>
			There are four pages in this lab. The 4 lab pages could be split across 3 or 4 days (150-200 minutes). Expected times to complete follow:
			<ul>
				<li>30-40 minutes on Rules of the Internet</li>
                <li>35-45 minutes on Regulating the Internet</li>
                <li>40-50 minutes on Censorship</li>
                <li>35-45 minutes on Computing Around the World</li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<h3>Prepare:</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/openers.html#computingnews" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> stories this week might focus on stories about computing from different parts of the world.</li>
                <li>Students will read parts of <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=247" target="_blank">Chapter 7 of <em>Blown to Bits</em></a>. The chapter goes in depth into the challenges of regulating the Internet. It explores different metaphors for the Internet and the ways that the government and courts have tried to use these metaphors in their decisions. These metaphors may provide interesting ways for you to get your students to think about the Internet. The chapter itself, as mentioned above, focuses much of its discussion on the regulation of pornographic content. This is because of our country's specific history and how it has dealt with First Amendment rights. Even without this focus, however, students can still consider issues of censorship, especially in ways that, for example, they might experience limits on what they are able to access in schools.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>


		<h3>Students will:</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Think of rules they would want (if any) regarding Internet content.</li>
                <li>Consider the challenges of regulating Internet content.</li>
                <li>Consider their own views on censorship and learn about Internet censorship around the world.</li>
                <li>Think of why they should care about Internet censorship.</li>
                <li>Look into some information about how much of the world has access to the Internet and think about consequences of and ways to eliminate the digital divide.</li>
			</ul>
		</div> 
			  
		
		<h3>As a Class:</h3>
        
        <div class="classIndent">
        
        <h4>Rules of the Internet</h4>
		<ul>
        	<li>Have students brainstorm, in partners first, and then with a class if you wish, ways that people can be harmed by what is put on the Internet. Examples could include cyberbullying messages, defamation (libel), personal data that gets revealed, incorrect medical advice, or lies meant to trick someone, to name a few.</li>
            <li>The questions under problem 2 are meant to inspire some debate. There are several ways to do this.
            <ul>
            	<li>You could have a whole class discussion.</li>
                <li>You could have 3 posters up in the room (or these can be 3 sections of a whiteboard, for example). Each poster addresses one of the questions. The first poster has two halves: "Yes, people should be allowed to say anything online" or "No, people should not be allowed to say anything they want online." The second poster has three sections: "The person posting the information should be held responsible" "The owner of the webpage should be held responsible" "No one should be held responsible." The third poster has two sections: "Yes they should be protected. Here's how" and "No, here's why." Then, give each student at least 3 sticky notes for them to write reasons for their opinion, and have them post these in the appropriate section. These can then serve as fodder for a whole-class discussion.</li>
                <li>You might choose to just deal with one of these questions (or allow students to choose one question to tackle). Students can come up with a short "soapbox" speech, a 2-minute speech where they defend their position on one of these questions.</li>
                <li>Instead of talking about reasons for supporting certain positions, you can focus the entire discussion on why these questions are complex. <em>Why</em> is it a complex issue to figure out if poeple should be allowed to say anything on the Internet? Reasons include free speech issues, the fact that it's possible to post anonymously, the fact that real people can be hurt by information online, the fact that people have different standards for what is appropriate or not, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Regulating the Internet</h4>
        
        <ul>
        	<li>
        </div>
