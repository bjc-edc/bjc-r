		<h2>Social Implications Lab 5: Censorship and Computing around the World</h2>
		<p>This lab takes the broad structure and content of <em>Blown to Bits</em> Chapter 7. Students first consider what rules (if any) ought to exist on the Internet and then learn of some of the practical difficulties of regulating Internet content. Students then consider some issues of free speech and are confronted with the fact that a global Internet leads to issues when different countries have different standards for what should be censored.

Chapter 7 in <em>Blown to Bits</em> examines censorship primarily in terms of how pornographic materials are treated online. The students are not assigned reading from most of these sections, but students may read these sections and have questions or raise issues. In materials about Internet censorship, specific countries are identified as having particularly harsh censorship policies. The United States is not immune from this, but be aware of statements that are made that appear to judge people of other nationalities. Part of the point of thinking through the social implications of these issues is to realize that these issues are not simple, and that different policies reflect different ways that societies have grappled with difficult and complex issues. Finally, students will discuss the "digital divide" at the end of this Lab. Be aware of students who themselves do not have a computer at home. The digital divide is not a
