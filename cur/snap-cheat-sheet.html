            Once you've learned how to program in one language (at least any language that your AP Computer Science Principles class would have used), it's <em>much</em> easier to learn another language. And Snap<em>!</em> will be especially easy to pick up quickly because it's all visual; you just snap blocks together, and you don't have to worry about any syntax (parentheses, commas, semicolons, quotation marks, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>This page is designed to get you up and running in Snap<em>!</em> as quickly as possible. It will help you pick up Snap<em>!</em> quickly if you take the time to read (or at least skim) this whole page.</p>

        <h4><strong>Creating a Snap<em>!</em> Account</strong></h4>
        <p>You will want to create a Snap<em>!</em> account so you can save and access all your Snap<em>!</em> projects in the cloud. (Technically don't need an account; you could download all your Snap<em>!</em> projects, save them locally, and then load them from your computer, but it is highly recommended to use one.) Instructions for creating an account and logging into and out of your Snap<em>!</em> account are on the first page of the Beauty and Joy of Computing CSP curriculum:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/1-creating-a-snap-account.html" title="Getting Started with Snap!">Getting Started with Snap<em>!</em></a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4><strong>Saving and Loading Snap<em>!</em> Projects</strong></h4>
        <p>It's a good idea to <em>save</em> your projects every so often: Choose "Save" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File button" title="File button"/>.</p>
        <p>To load a project, choose "Open..." from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu, select the project you wish to open, and click "Open."</p>

        <h4><strong>The Snap<em>!</em> Interface</strong></h4>
        <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/interface.jpg" alt="" title="" />
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>Toolbar</strong> includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Snap<em>!</em> menu, <img class="inline" style="height:30px; background-color:#333;" src="/bjc-r/img/course/snap-logo-large.png" alt="Snap! logo" title="Snap! logo" />, where you can find the detailed Snap<em>!</em> <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/help/SnapManual.pdf" title="Snap Manual" target="_blank">reference manual</a></li>
                        <li>The File Menu, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>, for loading and saving projects and loading libraries and sprite costumes and sounds</li>
                        <li>The Cloud menu, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" alt="Cloud menu button" title="Cloud menu button">, for logging in/out and changing your Snap<em>!</em> password</li>
                        <li>The Settings menu, <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/settings_button.png" alt="Settings menu button" title="Settings menu button" />, for controlling the Snap<em>!</em> interface</li>
                        <li>The Visible Stepping button, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/visible_stepping_button.png" alt="Visible Stepping button" title="Visible Stepping button" />, for debugging your code by running it slowly or even one block at time</li>
                        <li>The Resize Stage button, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/screen-size_button.png" alt="Resize Stage button" title="Resize Stage button" />, for controlling the size of the stage</li>
                        <li>The Presentation Mode button, <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/presentation-mode.png" alt="presentation mode button" title="presentation mode button" />, for switching between seeing a project code beside the stage and seeing only the stage (presentation mode)</li>
                        <li>The Green Flag button, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="Green Flag button" title="Green Flag button" />, which starts any blocks that begin with a <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-green-flag-clicked-full-size.png" alt="when green flag clicked" title="when green flag clicked" /> block</li>
                        <li>The Pause button, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pause_button.png" alt="Pause button" title="Pause button" />, which pauses the running of your code</li>
                        <li>The Stop button, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="Stop button" title="Stop button"/>, which stops all scripts in your project</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>   
                    <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/motion-palette-categories.jpg" alt="Palette categories: Motion, Looks, Sound, Pen, Control, Sensing, Operators, and Variables" title="Palette categories: Motion, Looks, Sound, Pen, Control, Sensing, Operators, and Variables" /> 
                    The <strong>Palette</strong> includes eight menus (shown right), where you will find all the blocks (procedures) in your project (built-in blocks, imported blocks, and custom blocks). Blocks appear in the palettes matching their color (except red and gray blocks which are in the orange "Variables" palette).
                </li>
                <div class="todo">Brian, I know you wanted block shapes here, and I had them here for a while, but it just didn't make sense to me to have them here (it was too much of a diversion from the topic at hand), so I moved them below. --MF, 3/28/20</div>
                <li>The <strong>Stage</strong> is the user interface for your project. One or more <em>sprites</em> (characters) live on and can talk and move around on the stage. Sprites begin with an arrowhead costume (as shown in the picture above), but you can change a sprite's costume (the picture that it wears) using the Costumes menu inside the File menu (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
                <li>The <strong>Scripting Area</strong> is where you drag blocks from the palette and snap them together to build your code. Above the scripting area are three tabs that allow you to view and edit the Scripts, Costumes (or Backgrounds), and Sounds for the sprite (or the stage) that you have selected in the "Sprite Corral."</li>
                <li>The <strong>Sprite Corral</strong> lets you select the sprite (or the stage) you want to work with (either to write or view code; to control the costumes or background; or to select, import, and record sounds).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>


        <h3>Code-Building Basics</h3>


        <h4><strong>Creating Scripts</strong></h4>
        <p>
            Drag one block underneath another to snap them together as you create your scripts. Every script you build in Snap<em>!</em> belongs either to a sprite or to the stage. Identifying words in block names such as "I" or "my" refer to that sprite or to the stage (depending on which one is selected in the sprite corral):<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/my-costume-reporting-bear.png" alt="my (costume) reporting a small picture of a white bear waving" title="my (costume) reporting a small picture of a white bear waving" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-i-am-clicked.png" alt="when i am (clicked)" title="when i am (clicked)" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Some blocks have little arrows that allow to you to control the inputs:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Downward pointing arrows (&blacktriangledown;) indicate dropdown menus with additional options:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/set-a-to-expression.png" alt="set (a) to (expression)" title="set (a) to (expression)" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/item.png" alt="item (1) of 'list input slot'" title="item (1) of 'list input slot'" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/is-a-number.png" alt="is ( ) a (number) ?" title="is ( ) a (number) ?" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/key-space-pressed-full-size.png" alt="key (space) pressed?" title="key (space) pressed?" />
                    <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/" alt="" title="" />
                    <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/" alt="" title="" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Left/right arrows (&blacktriangleleft; &blacktriangleright;) indicate that you can control the number of input slots:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/join-hello-world-reporting.png" alt="join (hello ) (world) reporting 'hello world'" title="join (hello ) (world) reporting 'hello world'" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/list-bananas-oranges-beans-rice.png" alt="list (bananas) (oranges) (beans) (rice)" title="list (bananas) (oranges) (beans) (rice)" />
                    <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/" alt="" title="" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/script-variables(a).png" alt="script variables (a)" title="script variables (a)" />
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>You can learn more about a particular block quickly by right-clicking it (or control-clicking it on a Mac) and selecting "help..." which will bring up a little window with information about how the block works. You can also just click it to see what it does.</p>


        <h4><strong>Block Shapes</strong></h4>
        <p>
            There are several different block shapes in Snap<em>!</em>, and they each have their own meaning and places they can be used:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Commands</em> have a rectangular, puzzle-piece shape. These are instructions that tell the computer to do something. They are designed to be snapped together one after another. Here are a few commands:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-full-size.png" alt="go to x: ( ) y: ( )" title="go to x: ( ) y: ( )" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/clear-full-size.png" alt="clear" title="clear" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-empty.png" alt="set ( ) to ( )" title="set ( ) to ( )" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Reporters</em> have a rounded shape. These blocks report (return) a value. They can either be clicked to report a value to the programmer or they can be dropped into an empty input slot of another block and used as input. Here are a few reporters reporting values:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/x-position-reporting-103.png" alt="x position reporting 103" title="x position reporting 103" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/my-costume-reporting-bear.png" alt="my (costume) reporting a small picture of a white bear waving" title="my (costume) reporting a small picture of a white bear waving" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/3-times-7-reporting-21.png" alt="(3) × (7) reporting 21" title="(3) × (7) reporting 21" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/list-bananas-oranges-beans-rice-reporting.png" alt="list (bananas) (oranges) (beans) (rice) reporting the list [bananas, oranges, beans, rice]" title="list (bananas) (oranges) (beans) (rice) reporting the list [bananas, oranges, beans, rice]" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/join-hello-world-reporting.png" alt="join (hello ) (world) reporting 'hello world'" title="join (hello ) (world) reporting 'hello world'" />
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <em>Predicates</em> have a hexagonal shape. They are are a special kind of reporter that only reports <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. They are used inside other blocks to help a program decide when to do something or what to report. Here are a few predicates:<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/greater-than.png" alt="( ) > ( )" title="( ) > ( )" />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pen-down-predicate.png" alt="pen down?" title="pen down?" />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-down-full-size.png" alt="mouse down?" title="mouse down?" />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/is-a-number.png" alt="is ( ) a (number) ?" title="is ( ) a (number) ?" />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/not.png" alt="not 'predicate input slot'" title="not 'predicate input slot'" />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/key-space-pressed-full-size.png" alt="key (space) pressed?" title="key (space) pressed?" />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/empty.png" alt="empty 'list input slot'" title="empty 'list input slot'" /><br />
                            And here are a few blocks that take Booleans (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) as input:<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if-full-size.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" title="if 'predicate input slot' 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" />

                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-until.png" alt="wait until 'predicate input slot'" title="wait until 'predicate input slot'" />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-predicate-input.png" alt="when 'predicate input slot' hat block" title="when 'predicate input slot' hat block" />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/not.png" alt="not 'predicate input slot'" title="not 'predicate input slot'" />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat-until.png" alt="repeat until 'predicate input slot' 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" title="repeat until 'predicate input slot' 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/and-full-size.png" alt="'predicate input slot' and 'predicate input slot'" title="'predicate input slot' and 'predicate input slot'" />
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Hat blocks</em> have a hat shape on top and a puzzle-piece shape at the bottom. They detect an event such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>). They can only go at the beginning of a script, and they tell rest of that script to run when that event occurs. (Not every script needs a hat block; you can also run a script by clicking on it.) Here are a few hat blocks:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-i-am-clicked.png" alt="when i am (clicked)" title="when i am (clicked)" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-space-key-pressed.png" alt="when (space) key pressed" title="when (space) key pressed" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-green-flag-clicked-full-size.png" alt="when 'green flag' clicked" title="when 'green flag' clicked" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-predicate-input.png" alt="when 'predicate input slot' hat block" title="when 'predicate input slot' hat block" />
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>


        <h4><strong>Communicating Between Sprites</strong></h4>
        <p>Of course, you can use global variables (more about them below) to share information between sprites, but you can also send messages between your sprites or have one sprite tell another sprite what to do:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sending messages:</strong> The <code>broadcast</code> block sends a message to all the sprites. To set the message, click the down arrow and select "new..."<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/broadcast-open.png" alt="broadcast block with menu open showing one option: new..." title="broadcast block with menu open showing one option: new..." />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/broadcast-game-ready-to-start.png" alt="broadcast (game ready to start)" title="broadcast (game ready to start)" />
                    <br />
                    Once that message has been sent out, any scripts in your project that begin with the <code>when I receive</code> hat block with hat same message will run: <br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/when-i-receive-showing-game-ready.png" alt="when I receive (game ready to start)" title="when I receive (game ready to start)" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><code>Tell</code>ing sprites what to do:</strong> You can tell a specific sprite (or the stage) what to do by using the <code>tell</code> block to send instructions (not just messages):
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/tell-sprite-2.png" alt="tell (Sprite2) to (go to x:(0) y:(0), stamp, say (I moved and stamped a copy of myself onto the stage!))" title="tell (Sprite2) to (go to x:(0) y:(0), stamp, say (I moved and stamped a copy of myself onto the stage!))" />
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4><strong>Creating Variables</strong></h4>
        <p>There are several kinds of variables in Snap<em>!</em>. Here are the most important:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global variables</strong> can be accessed from anywhere in your program. You can create them by clicking the <img class="inlines" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/make-a-variable.png" alt="Make a Variable" title="" />button in the Variables palette.</li>
                <li><strong>Local (script variables)</strong> only exist within the script that creates them. You can create local variables using the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/script-variables(a).png" alt="script variables (a)" title="script variables (a)" /> block. Place that block at the point in your code where you want to create a variable, click the variable name to change it if you want, click the right arrow (&blacktriangleright;) if you want to create additional variables at the same point in your program, and drag the variable off to use it in the code below it.</li>
                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/draw-square-def.png" alt="draw square, size: (size) {
    pen down
    repeat (4) {
        move (size) steps
        turn ↻ (90) degrees
    }
}" title="draw square, size: (size) {
    pen down
    repeat (4) {
        move (size) steps
        turn ↻ (90) degrees
    }
}" />
                <li><strong>Input variables (parameters)</strong> store the input values (arguments) passed to a custom block. For example, <var>size</var> is an input variable to the <code>draw square</code> block shown at right. There is more information about creating blocks with input parameters below.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Iteration variables</strong> change in value as a block repeats a set of commands. You can change the name of an iteration variable by clicking on it. In Snap<em>!</em>, there are two iteration blocks that have built in variables: <code>for</code> uses <var>i</var> (unless you change the name) to hold the index number of the iteration, and <code>for each</code> uses <var>item</var> (unless you change the name) to hold each list item as it traverses (travels through) the list:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/for-full-size.png" alt="for (i) = (1) to (10) 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" title="for (i) = (1) to (10) 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/for-each-(item)-of().png" alt="for each (item) of 'list input slot' 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" title="for each (item) of 'list input slot' 'c-shaped input slot for instructions'" />
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Because Snap<em>!</em> is a visual language (not a text-based language), you can use multi-word variable names. It will be clear to you and others when reading the code that those separate words are all part of the same variable name:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/multi-word-variable-names-example.png" alt="set (player 1 score) to ((player 1 score) + (points from this round))" title="set (player 1 score) to ((player 1 score) + (points from this round))" />
        </p>
    
    
        <h4><strong>Creating Custom Procedures</strong></h4>
        <p>
            To program your own block:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Create a new block.</strong> There are several ways to start: click <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/make-a-block.png" alt="make a block button" title="make a block button" /> near the end of the palette, click the <b>+</b> sign in the top right corner of the palette (shown below), or right-click (or control-click on a Mac) on any empty spot in the scripting area and choose "make a block..." (shown below).<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/plus-sign.png" alt="plus sign atop palette" title="plus sign atop palette" />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/make-a-block.jpg" alt="make a block option" title="make a block option" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Choose the color</strong> (palette), <strong>type the title</strong>, <strong>select the shape</strong> (block type), and click OK.<br />
                    <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/make-a-block-labeled.png" alt="image of 'Make a block' dialog box with palette with 10 menus (Motion, Looks, Pen, Sound, Lists, Control, Sensing, Operation, Variables, Other) labeled 'Choose a color (a palette)'; a text box labeled 'Type a title for your block.'; three block shape options (puzzle-shaped/'Command', oval/'Reporter', and hexagonal/'Predicate') labeled 'Select a shape.'; two radio boxes (for all sprites, which is checked, and for this sprite only, which is not checked) with no label; and two buttons (OK and Cancel) labeled 'Click OK.'" title="image of 'Make a block' dialog box with palette with 10 menus (Motion, Looks, Pen, Sound, Lists, Control, Sensing, Operation, Variables, Other) labeled 'Choose a color (a palette)'; a text box labeled 'Type a title for your block.'; three block shape options (puzzle-shaped/'Command', oval/'Reporter', and hexagonal/'Predicate') labeled 'Select a shape.'; two radio boxes (for all sprites, which is checked, and for this sprite only, which is not checked) with no label; and two buttons (OK and Cancel) labeled 'Click OK.'" />
                    <ul>
                        <li>Just as you can use multi-word variable names in Snap<em>!</em>, you can use multi-word names for your blocks (custom procedures).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Program your block.</strong> Drag in blocks from the palette, snap them in after the hat block, and click OK.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Note that if you create a reporter or predicate block, the block editor will open with a <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/report.png" alt="report" title="report" /> block already attached to the hat block. All of your block code will go between these two blocks or inside the <code>report</code> block; whatever input you give to <code>report</code> will be the value reported (returned) by your new block.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    
        <h4><strong>Creating Custom Procedures with Input Parameters</strong></h4> 
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Create a new block, choose the color and shape, type the block name <em>and the label for your input</em>, and click OK</strong>.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/make-a-block-input.png" alt="image of the 'Make a Block' window with the Motion palette selected and 'draw square, size:' typed into the title input space" title="image of the 'Make a Block' window with the Motion palette selected and 'draw square, size:' typed into the title input space" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Click a plus sign (+)</strong> between (or before or after) the words in your hat block where you want the input slot to appear. Then, <strong>type the name of the input</strong>, and click OK.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/draw-square-size+.png" alt="hat block labeled 'draw square, size:' with a dark circle with a plus sign in it just after 'size:'" title="hat block labeled 'draw square, size:' with a dark circle with a plus sign in it just after 'size:'" />

                    <ul>
                        <li>You can also add text to the name of the block by clicking a + sign: Just change the option in the "Create input name" menu from "Input name" to "Title text."</li>
                        <li>
                            If you can't see the + signs, hover your mouse pointer over where they would be, or just turn off "Plain prototype labels" in the Snap<em>!</em> Settings menu:<br />
                            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/plain-protoype-labels.jpg" alt="image of the Snap! Settings menu showing the 'Plain prototype labels' option highlighted and checked; there is a hover-over bubble that says 'uncheck to always show (+) symbols in block prototype labels'" title="image of the Snap! Settings menu showing the 'Plain prototype labels' option highlighted and checked; there is a hover-over bubble that says 'uncheck to always show (+) symbols in block prototype labels'" />
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Program your block</strong>, dragging in the input variable wherever you need it.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>


        <h4><strong>Input Types</strong></h4>
        <p>There are several kinds of input slots that tell the programmer what kind of data is expected:
            <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: auto auto;">
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Number: <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/move-empty-full-size.png" alt="move 'rounded number input slot' steps" title="move 'rounded number input slot' steps" /><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/a-times-b.png" alt="( ) 'rounded number input slot' ( )" title="( ) 'rounded number input slot' ( )" /></li>
                        <li>List: <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/length-list-big.png" alt="length of 'list input slot'" title="length of 'list input slot'" /><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/empty.png" alt="empty 'list input slot' ?" title="empty 'list input slot' ?" /></li>
                        <li>Boolean: <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/not.png" alt="not 'predicate input slot'" title="not 'predicate input slot'" /><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-until.png" alt="wait until 'predicate input slot'" title="wait until 'predicate input slot'" /></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Group of commands: <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever-full-size.png" alt="forever 'c-shaped input slot'" title="forever 'c-shaped input slot'" /><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if-full-size.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' 'c-shaped input slot'" title="forever 'predicate input slot' 'c-shaped input slot'" /></li>
                    <li>Any type: <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-empty-full-size.png" alt="say 'rectangular text input slot'" title="say 'rectangular text input slot'" /><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join()().png" alt="join 'rectangular text input slot' 'rectangular text input slot'" title="join 'rectangular text input slot' 'rectangular text input slot'" /></li>
                </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can chose the input type for the input variables in your custom blocks by clicking the right arrow (&blacktriangleright;) to the right of the "Input name" option in the "Create input name" window. It's not necessary to set an input type in Snap<em>!</em>. If you don't select one, your input slot will accept any type of input.<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/create-input-name-type-arrow.png" alt="Create Input Name dialog box with a read circle around the right-facing arrow just to the right of the 'Input name' option" title="Create Input Name dialog box with a read circle around the right-facing arrow just to the right of the 'Input name' option" />
        </p>
            

        <h4><strong>Grouping Data: Lists/Arrays/Etc.</strong></h4>
        <p>Snap<em>!</em> uses <em>lists</em> to group a bunch of values. If you learned to program in another language, you may have used arrays. In Snap<em>!</em>, lists are ordered, and the first item in a list is item number 1. (Some languages have the first the first item be 0, and the second is 1, the third is 2, etc.). Also in Snap<em>!</em>, list items do not all have to be the same data type. For example, a single list can contain text, numbers, images, sounds, blocks, and even other lists.</p>
        <p>To create a list, use the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/list-full-size.png" alt="list ( )" title="list ( )" /> block. You can read about several other commonly used Snap<em>!</em> list blocks on the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/reference-sheet.html" title="Snap! vs. AP Exam Language">Snap<em>!</em> vs. AP Exam Language</a> page:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/item-empty-full-size.png" alt="item ( ) of 'list input slot'" title="item ( ) of 'list input slot'" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/insert.png" alt="insert ( ) at (1) of 'list input slot'" title="insert ( ) at (1) of 'list input slot'" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/add.png" alt="add ( ) to 'list input slot'" title="add ( ) to 'list input slot'" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/delete.png" alt="delete (1) of 'list input slot'" title="delete (1) of 'list input slot'" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/replace.png" alt="replace item (1) of 'list input slot' with ( )" title="replace item (1) of 'list input slot' with ( )" />
            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/for-each-item-in-list.png" alt="for each (item) in (list)" title="for each (item) in (list)" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Python users can use Snap<em>!</em> lists to recreate the behavior of data aggregates:
            <ul>
                <li>A <pre class="inline">tuple</pre> is just a list that you don't modify.</li>
                <li>A <pre class="inline">set</pre> is unordered; so just use a list and don't make any assumptions about order. Also, Python sets aren't supposed to include the same value more than once. So when you extend a set, use <code>remove duplicates</code> from the Snap<em>!</em> "List Utilities" library, which you can access from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu.</li>
                <li>
                    A <pre class="inline">dictionary</pre> is just a list of two-item lists. In each small list, the first item is the <em>key</em> and the second item is the <em>value</em>. In Snap<em>!</em>, this might look like:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/ref-guide/dictionary-example.png" alt="list (list (first name) (Betsy)) (list (last name) (Anderson)) (list (phone number) (212-555-1234))" title="list (list (first name) (Betsy)) (list (last name) (Anderson)) (list (phone number) (212-555-1234))" /><br />
                    In Snap<em>!</em>, you can use <code>assoc</code> from the "List Utilities" library to search for a key-value pair and then use <code>item (2) of</code> to select the value.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Some things that are reporters have checkboxes to their left in the palette and what those so is make watchers appear.</p>

        <h4><strong>Using Visible Stepping</strong></h4>
        <p>Snap<em>!</em> has a tool called <strong>Visible Stepping</strong> that allows you to control how quickly Snap<em>!</em> steps through the blocks of your code. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Click the Visible Stepping button (<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/visible-stepping.png" alt="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" title="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" />), and adjust the slider to control the stepping speed. When you run your code, the sprite will slowly execute each step of the code and highlight it in <span style="color: black; background-color:cyan">cyan</span>.

        <h3>Additional Programming Topics</h3>

<h4>Snap<em>!</em> Libraries</h4>
<p>Most languages have libraries of operations you can apply to lists: combine two lists, sort a list, etc.  Ours is called "List Utilities."</p>

<h4>Higher Order Functions</h4>
Snap! provides other ways to deal with lists: higher order functions and recursion.  HOFs let you consider a list as a single value, dealing with its items all at once instead of singling out a specific item by its index:
MAP...
KEEP...
FIND FIRST...
COMBINE...

<h4>Recursion</h4>

Recursion lets you deal with a list by left-to-right traversal, but without the use of index variables.  Instead, you split the list into its first item and a sublist with all but the first item:
ITEM 1 OF foo
ALL BUT FIRST OF foo
You compute some function of the first item, and combine that with a call to the same procedure you're writing:
PLURALS words
