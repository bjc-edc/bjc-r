            <ul>
            	<li>For the general text, leave things wrapped in "p" tags. Use "div" tags for any of the colorful styles below or for groups of multiplethings (like text and an image, etc.).</li>
                <li>Images <em>do not need</em> to be wrapped in "div" tags. Images can be placed on either side using class="imageRight" or class="imageLeft" in the "img" tag.</li>

        <h3>File Naming Conventions</h3>
        <div class="takeNote">Our server is cAsE SeNSiTIve so even if things look ok on your browser, they might not on bjc.edc.org. The most essential thing is that <strong>the case of the reference has to match the case of the file <em>exactly</em></strong>.</div>
        <p>
            Here are some conventions that we should all be using:
            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Image files</strong> should be in <strong>all lowercase</strong>, e.g. hierarchical-3.jpg or map3x+7.png, and they can't have any spaces (use a dash) or weird characters like &times;. Exception: abbreviations, e.g., URL-structure.jpg, TCP.png, or GPS-map.png. In all cases, the references must match the filename <em>exactly</em>.</li>
                <li><strong>Project files</strong> should begin with the unit and lab numbers followed by a dash and then have a few Title Case words that describe the project separated by dashes, e.g., <strong>U2L3-GuessNumber.xml, U3L2-DrawShape.xml, U4L3-BigNumbers.xml</strong>. The title of the project in Snap should be the same as the filename minus the extension, e.g. U2L3-GuessNumber, etc. The references must match the filename <em>exactly</em>.</li>
                <li><strong>Lab pages</strong> should begin with the lab page number followed by a few words that approximate the lab page title, no spaces (use dashes), all lowercase, e.g., 1-shopping-list-app.html, 3-read-web.html, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>TG pages</strong> should follow the same format as lab pages except starting with the lab number rather than the lab <em>page</em> number.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>LaTeX</h3>
        <p>You can now insert <strong>inline</strong> LaTeX (such as <span class="katex">\| f + g \| \le \|f\|+\|g\|</span>) using the following syntax:
        <center><strong>&lt;span class="katex"&gt;</strong>\| f + g \| \le \|f\|+\|g\|<strong>&lt;/span&gt;</strong></center>
        <p>Block-based LaTeX (that renders on its own line) can be used with the syntax <strong>class="katex-block"</strong>. For example:<span class="katex-block">\| f + g \| \le \|f\|+\|g\|</span></p>
        <p>Please do not use the dollar-sign delimiters any more. The former replaces single dollar-sign delimiters and the latter replaces double dollar-sign delimiters.</p>
        <p>The name "<span id="katex">\KaTeX</span>" is the current LaTeX library, which is developed by Khan Academy.</p>
        
        <h3>Page Elements</h3>
        <p>"Getting Started" is an optional (for us&mdash;it's required for students) <em>HTML page</em> at the beginning of each lab. "Take it Further" is a <em>page element</em> that we can (optionally) place at the end of each lab or wherever makes sense.</p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <p>This is a made with a div within a div. The class of the surrounding div is "forYouToDo".</p>
            <ol>
                <li>To avoid having the title "For You To Do" appear several times on the same page, use id="first" for the first instance of class="forYouToDo" and not in the others. (Note: ID is used for something that only appears once; we are IDing that one as the first one.)</li>
                <li>Note that this second For You To Do also differs in that the &lt;ol&gt; tag has start="4" inside it so that the list starts in the right place.</li>
                <li>These are called "problems" (and not "exercises" or "tasks").</li>
                <li>Here are a bunch of icons you can use to say certain things that we will say over and over again (it's probably nice to have these on the right and to let the text wrap around them.):</li>

                <li>These next two have text in them that you get to add so it requires a little extra HTML. (<em>Be sure to edit both 1. the text in the span and 2. the alt and title text for the image.</em>)</li>

        <div class="takeItFurther">
            <br clear="all" />Here is a list of other formatting we can use:<br />
            <div class="commentBig">I think it's better to use uppercase letters for the TIF divs because if there are, for example, FYTD problems 1-4, and then TIF 5-6, and then more FYTD problems, it's weird to reference them as 7, 8, 9 rather than continuing at 5. This way, the optional problems have their own count (with uppercase letters). Then the subproblems in TIF would be lowercase roman numerals (as shown here).<br /> Note: for some reason, the first &lt;ol&gt; tag can use an <code>type="A"</code> atribute, but the nested ones must be done with CSS:<br /><br /> &lt;ol type="A"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first level will be numbered with uppercase letters.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ol style="list-style:lower-roman;"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;This will be a 2nd level lower-roman list.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/ol&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ol&gt;</div>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>
                    Use the "code" tag for <code>code</code>. Reference blocks (e.g. <code>pen down</code>) using the "code" tag or an image of the actual block: <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pen-down.png" class="block"/>. 
                    <ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
                        <li>Note: The <code>code</code> tag has been used all over the place in the previous version of BJC. Please try to keep it to only actual code blocks.</li>
                        <li>Re: variables and mathematics&mdash;If you are referencing a mathematical variable that you have made into a <span class="snap">snap</span> variable (hence, a block) then use the code tag (or an image of the block). If you are referencing the plus/minus/etc. block, use the code tag (or an image of the block). If you are just discussing a mathematical idea, then use regular notation: e.g. <em>x</em> + <em>y</em> = 7. </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li> Syntax for <code>code</code> tags <em>and</em> alt/title text:
                    <ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
                        <li>Use parentheses for numerical or text inputs and square brackets for scripts (stacks of command blocks).</li>
                        <li>(When <em>naming</em> a block, as opposed to showing an invocation with inputs, just use the first word, e.g. <code>map</code> or <code>join</code>, unless this is ambiguous, e.g., the <code>go</code> block vs. the <code>go to x:y:</code> block.)</li>
                        <li>

                                <li>If absolutely necessary, use, e.g., "fill in the blank in <code>move () steps</code> below."</li>

        <p>Let's not use the following colored boxes at all:</p>
        <div class="alert quoteBlue">Blue Box - determine the meaning of these elements on a case by case basis and use one of our styles above instead.</div>

        <div class="alert quoteOrange">Orange Box - etc.</div>
        <div class="alert quoteYellow">Yellow Box - same thing ;)</div>
		<p>(If we like the look, we can reintegrate them, but for now, let's change each one over to our own styles above. I asked, and these didn't have much specific meaning in previous BJC versions.)</p>

        <div>
        	<ol>
            	<li>Build the script you want in <span class="snap">snap</span></li>
                <li>If you want to make a big picture of a short script, choose "Zoom blocks" from the settings menu and enter "1.5"; otherwise, just leave it at "1" for single line blocks. </li>
                <li>Scroll around to locate the script</li>
                <li>Right click the script and choose "script pic..."</li>
                <li>Save the file to the unit's <em>new</em> image directory, e.g. /bjc-r/img/3-lists or to a shared directory, as appropriate. (If it's a script or a block with inputs that is not likely to be used again, please store the image in the unit image directory; if it's a blank block or a block with default inputs, then it should go in the "blocks" image directory.)</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>How to Make an Animation<a name="animation" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
        <p>See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD9wiyBlJ9Y" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD9wiyBlJ9Y</a></p>
		<p>Or just follow these instructions (<strong>be sure to also read about animation controls below</strong>):
            <ol>
                <li>Make a screen recording (suggested method: Quicktime Player).</li>
                <li>Open Photoshop, go to File &gt; Import &gt; "Video Frames to Layers," and select your movie file.</li>
                <li>Limit to every 2 or 3 frames depending on how fast your video moves (as we like to say, experiment!). </li>
                <li>If needed, show the timeline by going to Window &gt; Timeline.</li>
                <li>If needed, change the speed by selecting all frames in your timeline (using shift), clicking the drop-down menu on one of the frames, and setting the frame delay to 0.1 seconds (or whatever looks good).</li>
                <li>Make the last few frames transparent (or add a few blank frames) so that there is a pause in the video as it loops.</li>
                <li>Go to File &gt; "Save for Web," choose GIF, set the dimensions of the image as you want them, be sure to set it to loop forever, and save it to the image folder of your unit.</li>
                <li>Don't forget to actually link to the image... ;)</li>
            </ol>

        <h4>How to Give Controls to your Animation</h4>
		<p>
        	<ol>
            	<li>
                	Add these <strong>three</strong> lines to your &lt;head&gt;:<br />
                	<code>
                        &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/bjc-r/utilities/gifffer.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
                    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;/bjc-r/css/bjc-gifffer.css&quot;&gt;<br />
                    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;window.onload = function() {Gifffer();}&lt;/script&gt; 
           	    </code>
          	  </li>
                <li>
                    Replace the "src" attribute in your &lt;img&gt; tag with &quot;data-gifffer&quot; so you have something like this: &lt;img data-gifffer=&quot;/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/mondrian-animation.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt; which yields this (you can click to start and stop):<br />
                    <img data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/mondrian-animation.gif" alt="" title=""/>
                </li>
                <li>NOTE: Make sure that the "class" attribute of the &lt;img&gt; tag is not "inline" or else the play button will land in the wrong place. If you want it to be inline, just delete the "class" attribute altogther. Using <code>class="indent"</code> seems to work fine.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        
    <h3>How<a name="script" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>to Link to a Project</h3>
        <div>
        	<ol>
            	<li>Build the script(s) you want in <span class="snap">snap</span> <strong>If the project contains custom blocks, be sure to not just build them, but <big>leave them up on the stage</big>. Opening a project that looks empty with a custom block buried in the palette has created confusion for folks.</strong></li>
                <li>Choose "Export project" from the file menu</li>
                <li>Save the XML file to the unit's PROG directory, e.g. /bjc-r/prog/3-lists</li>
                <li>
                	In the lab page HTML file where you want to link, place a picture of the script(s) wrapped with an "a href" tag linking to the XML file with class="run" in the "a href" tag. For example:<br />
                	<a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/loop/draw-a-square.xml"> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/prog-create-square-code-BYOB.gif" alt="Square example image" title="Square example image"> </a><br />
                    <big><strong><em>Note that clicking the link starts a brand new project!  Any work that the student has done prior to this link will NOT be available!!</em></strong></big>
                </li>
            </ol>
            Principles for when to include a script:
            <ul>
                <li>Early on, and for simple scripts (and minimal or no typing), getting them to build is useful practice.</li>
                <li>For complicated scripts that we want them to test and/or modify, let them load it.  Saves time and guarantees they're testing what we actually intended.</li>
                <li>For lists with lots of typing, let them load initial versions, especially for getting started or experiments.  Again, reduces overhead. Also, they can always tailor if they want.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        
        <h3>How<a name="cloud" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>to Load a Project NOT in Presentation with #cloud in the URL</h3>
        <div class="todo"><big><em><strong>Please note:</strong></em></big> In the following examples, Jens is using a direct link to his projects. <big><em><strong>Do not direct include links to your projects in the curriculum.</strong></em></big> Instead, follow the instructions just above that describe how to upload the XML file to /prog so that 1) other developers can edit it and 2) your changes to your own project file won't impact the curriculum.</div>
		<p>From Jens: you can use #cloud to open a shared project in edit mode without running it right away.</p>
        <p>There are also three switches you can add to the #present: url to get more control over what will be displayed:
        	<ol>
            	<li><code>&amp;editMode</code>: this will also NOT switch to presentation mode, but it will still run the project right away.</li>
                <ul><li><a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&ProjectName=Mesmerize&editMode" target="_blank">http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&amp;ProjectName=Mesmerize&amp;editMode</a></li></ul>
                <li><code>&amp;noRun</code>: this switch will prevent the project from running immediately (it won't fire the green flag event).</li>
                <ul>
                	<li>You can use it together with other switches, e.g. <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&ProjectName=Mesmerize&editMode&noRun" target="_blank">http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&amp;ProjectName=Mesmerize&amp;editMode&amp;noRun</a>.</li>
                    <li>but also alone: <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&ProjectName=Mesmerize&noRun" target="_blank">http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&amp;ProjectName=Mesmerize&amp;noRun</a></li>
                </ul>
                <li><code>&amp;hideControls</code>: this switch hides the green-flag, pause,  stop, and edit/presentation (useful for &quot;hiding&quot; the code) buttons. This is useful when embedding Snap projects into other web pages using iFrames. You can also use this in combination with other switches, but it makes the most sense in presentation mode.</li>
                <ul><li><a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&ProjectName=Mesmerize&hideControls" target="_blank">http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&amp;ProjectName=Mesmerize&amp;hideControls</a></li></ul>
			</ol>
        </p>

        <h3>How<a name="anchors" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>to Link to a Specfic Part of a Page Using Anchors</h3>
        <p>
        	There are two parts of a link with an anchor (the link and the anchor):
            <ol>
                <li>
                    First, place the <strong>anchor</strong> on the target page:
                    <ul><li>
                        &lt;a name="picture" class="anchor"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;</li>
                        <li>Put that &amp;nbsp; (non-breaking space) in there, and use the whole thing (opening tag, &amp;nbsp; and closing tag) as a space, replacing some space in the line your want to link to.
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then, create a link, just like usual except add a hashtag and the anchor name to the end of the <strong>link</strong>: 
                    <ul><li>
                        For example: &lt;a href="/bjc-r/docs/style_guide.html#picture"&gt;This would link to the "How to Make a Picture of Blocks"&lt;/a&gt;, section above. <a href="/bjc-r/docs/style_guide.html#picture">Try it!</a>
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>The #moveturn in the reference (a href) scrolls to that anchor (a name). (The anchor class is a workaround to scroll past the heading at the top of each lab page; it goes in the "a name" only; we hope to fix that one day.)</p>
        <p>Dreamweaver will maintain these links over time if you move and rename files in DW. Otherwise if you move or rename a files (outside DW) you will have to fix all the links yourself.</p>
