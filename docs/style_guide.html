        <h3>Pedagogic Design Principles<a name="principles" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
        <div>
        	<ul>
            	<li>Less text --Paul</li>
                <li>Less distraction on page --Paul</li>
                <li>Shorter pages --Paul</li>
                <li>Project oriented --Paul</li>
                <li><strong>Pages must be doable.</strong> Please test your page by working through the page following each instruction as literally as possible. See how well we get the student to the place we intended. --Mary</li>
                <li><strong>Use any CS tool</strong> (abstraction, recursion, etc.) <strong>only where it makes sense to.</strong> Don't force anything into a project just to teach the tool; tools should be applied as they reasonably might arise. Their use has to be believable--Mary</li>
                <li><strong>Build in possible future generalizations only when it makes sense to.</strong> There are always more generalizations that could be made. When programming we only build in the ones we know we will need. We don't build in extras (just in case unless there is a good change we will need it. --Mary</li>
			</ul>
        </div>
        
        
        <h3>Writing Conventions<a name="writing" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<div>
            <ul>
                <li>Words banned from the curriculum:  "fun," "let's" (except in dialogs). Not quite banned, but to be avoided: &quot;powerful.&quot;</li>
                <li>A "block" is one block.  
                  <ul>
                    <li>A block with inputs filled in is an "<strong>expression</strong>" (if the outer block is a reporter) or an "<strong>instruction</strong>" (if a command). </li>
                    <li>Multiple blocks strung together is a "<strong>script</strong>" or a "<strong>program</strong>."</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>We don't "put" or "build" blocks inside blocks; we "<strong>use</strong>" blocks inside blocks.</li>
				<li><strong>Lists have <em>items</em></strong>, not members or elements, because of the ITEM block.</li>
                <li><strong>Reporters <em>report</em></strong> (not return) values.</li>
                <li>References to text within Snap<em>!</em> (such as the "OK" button or the "Motion" palette) should be in quotes.</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        
        
        <h3>HTML Conventions<a name="HTML" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
            	<li>Use the "strong" tag for <strong>bold</strong>. Introduce <strong>new terminology</strong> using the strong tag.</li>
                <li>Use the "em" tag for <em>italics</em>. The "em" tag is for <em>em</em>phasis (not vocab).</li>
                <li>
                	<strong>All text must be inside something.</strong> If it's not in a sidenote, a list, or a table, then it should be in a "p" tag. Lists themselves should be inside "p" or "div" tags. Use "div" tags for the CSS styles shown below or for groups of multiple things (like text and an image, etc.).
					<ul>
						<li>Images do <em>not</em> need to be wrapped in "div" tags. Images can be placed on either side using class="imageRight" or class="imageLeft" in the "img" tag. Otherwise, use class="indent" for images on their own lines (as long as they aren't massively wide).</li>
					</ul>
            	</li>
                <li>Please do not use "height" or "width" HTML attributes within the img tag; this can cause deformed images in various ways (e.g., percentages vary with window-size, fixed sizing distorts if images are re-uploaded by someone else, etc.). Size the image properly before uploading.</li>
                <li><strong>Please indent code</strong> with 4 spaces (one tab) for each new level. This is so your code is readable to your colleages.</li>
                <li>Use <code>Snap&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;</code> to write <strong>Snap<em>!</em></strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        
    	<h3>File Naming Conventions<a name="naming" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<div class="sideHOM">Our server is cAsE SeNSiTIve so even if things look ok on your browser, they might not on bjc.edc.org. The most essential thing is that <strong>the case of the reference has to match the case of the file <em>exactly</em></strong>.</div>
        <div>
			<ul>
            	<li><strong>Image files</strong> should be in <em>all lowercase</em> (e.g. hierarchical-3.jpg or map3x+7.png) and have <em>no spaces</em> (use dashes) and <em>no weird characters</em> like &times;. <em>Exception: abbreviations</em> (e.g., URL-structure.jpg, TCP.png, or GPS-map.png). All images are to be stored in their unit folder in /img.</li>
                <li><strong>Snap<em>!</em> Project files</strong> should begin with the unit and lab numbers followed by a few Title Case words describing the project. Use dashes not spaces. (For example: U2L3-GuessNumber.xml, U3L2-DrawShape.xml, U4L3-BigNumbers.xml).) The title of the project in Snap<em>!</em> should be the same as the filename minus the extension, (e.g. U2L3-GuessNumber, etc.). All projects are to be stored in their unit folder in /prog.</li>
                <li><strong>Lab pages</strong> should begin with the lab page number followed by a few words that approximate the lab page title, no spaces (use dashes), all lowercase, (e.g., 1-shopping-list-app.html, 3-read-web.html, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>TG pages</strong> should follow the same format as lab pages except starting with the lab number rather than the lab <em>page</em> number.</li>
                <li><strong>For all links:</strong> the references must match the filenames <em>exactly</em>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        
        <h3>KaTeX<a name="katex" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
        <div class="comment">
            <p>Please do not use the dollar-sign delimiters any more. We have changed systems.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
        	<ul>
            	<li>
                	You can insert <strong>inline</strong> LaTeX (such as <span class="katex">\| f + g \| \le \|f\|+\|g\|</span>) using a span with <strong>class="katex"</strong>. For example:<br />
            		<center><code>&lt;span class="katex"&gt; \| f + g \| \le \|f\|+\|g\|&lt;/span&gt;</code></center>
                </li>
                <li>Centered, <strong>full-line</strong> LaTeX can be created using the syntax <strong>class="katex-block"</strong> in a span. This would render the same example on its own line like this:<span class="katex-block">\| f + g \| \le \|f\|+\|g\|</span></li>

                <li>Add the code <code>&lt;p style=&quot;clear: both; height: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> inside a div to keep an image from falling out of it OR to keep a side div from pushing down into the following div.</li>
                <li>Add the code <code>style=&quot;clear: right;&quot;</code> to the following div if an image in white text is pushing down into a div.</li>

                <li>Students can use any colors they want. </li>
                <li>If the context for a block is clear, we will use the appropriate palette. Otherwise, use grey.</li>
                <li>For selector/constructors use operator green. </li>
                <li>In XML project files, always put any custom blocks that we want students to find in the scripting area so they don't have to go digging around for it.</li>

If you are referencing the plus/minus/etc. block, use the code tag (or an image of the block). If you are just discussing a mathematical idea, then use regular notation: e.g. <em>x</em> + <em>y</em> = 7. </li>

                        <li>Use parentheses for numerical or text inputs and square brackets for scripts (stacks of command blocks).</li>
                        <li>(When <em>naming</em> a block, as opposed to showing an invocation with inputs, just use the first word, e.g. <code>map</code> or <code>join</code>, unless this is ambiguous, e.g., the <code>go</code> block vs. the <code>go to x:y:</code> block.)</li>

        <h3>How to Make an Animation<a name="animation" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
        <p>See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD9wiyBlJ9Y" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD9wiyBlJ9Y</a></p>
		<p>Or just follow these instructions (<strong>be sure to also read about animation controls below</strong>):
			<ol>
                <li>Make a screen recording (suggested method: Quicktime Player).</li>
                <li>Open Photoshop, go to File &gt; Import &gt; "Video Frames to Layers," and select your movie file.</li>
                <li>Limit to every 2 or 3 frames depending on how fast your video moves (as we like to say, experiment!). </li>
                <li>If needed, show the timeline by going to Window &gt; Timeline.</li>
                <li>If needed, change the speed by selecting all frames in your timeline (using shift), clicking the drop-down menu on one of the frames, and setting the frame delay to 0.1 seconds (or whatever looks good).</li>
                <li>Make the last few frames transparent (or add a few blank frames) so that there is a pause in the video as it loops.</li>
                <li>Go to File &gt; "Save for Web," choose GIF, set the dimensions of the image as you want them, be sure to set it to loop forever, and save it to the image folder of your unit.</li>
                <li>Don't forget to actually link to the image... ;)</li>
			</ol>
        </p>
        <h4>How to Give Controls to your Animation</h4>
		<p>
			<ol>
            	<li>
                	Add these <strong>three</strong> lines to your &lt;head&gt;:<br />
                	<code>
                        &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/bjc-r/utilities/gifffer.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
						&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;/bjc-r/css/bjc-gifffer.css&quot;&gt;<br />
                        &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;window.onload = function() {Gifffer();}&lt;/script&gt; 
					</code>
				</li>
                <li>
                    Replace the "src" attribute in your &lt;img&gt; tag with &quot;data-gifffer&quot; so you have something like this: &lt;img data-gifffer=&quot;/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/mondrian-animation.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt; which yields this (you can click to start and stop):<br />
                    <img data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/6-recursion/mondrian-animation.gif" alt="" title=""/>
                </li>
                <li>NOTE: Make sure that the "class" attribute of the &lt;img&gt; tag is not "inline" or else the play button will land in the wrong place. If you want it to be inline, just delete the "class" attribute altogther. Using <code>class="indent"</code> seems to work fine.</li>
			</ol>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Snap<em>!</em><a name="XML" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>XML file Conventions</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Please use "clean up" to line up all scripts neatly, then check if it's the order you most want and, if necessary, rearrange and use "clean up" again. It's just neater, and also makes sure we can see scripts even when the window is narrow.</li>
                <li>Make sure that the scripts that students are to manipulate are the ones they see when the file is loaded.</li>
                <li>Each file will have its own features, so there's no "general" style to use, but always consider which elements are essential and which merely cosmetic. In general, except when we are explicitly teaching about UI, UI is more cosmetic. (E.g., whether we initiate some action by clicking on the script, the sprite, or in some other way can be essential, but is often just a personal choice.) Please use only essential, and let students add their own personal touches.</li>
                <li>Consider when comments help and when they clutter. One or two that label things can often be a help, but you decide.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        
		<h3>How<a name="script" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>to Link to a Project</h3>
        <div>
        	<ol>
            	<li>Build the script(s) you want in <span class="snap">snap</span> <strong>If the project contains custom blocks, be sure to not just build them, but <big>leave them up in the scripting area</big>. Opening a project that looks empty with a custom block buried in the palette has created confusion for folks.</strong></li>
                <li>Choose "Export project" from the file menu</li>
                <li>Save the XML file to the unit's PROG directory, e.g. /bjc-r/prog/3-lists</li>
                <li>
                	In the lab page HTML file where you want to link, place a picture of the script(s) wrapped with an "a href" tag linking to the XML file with class="run" in the "a href" tag. For example:<br />
                	<a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/loop/draw-a-square.xml"> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/prog-create-square-code-BYOB.gif" alt="Square example image" title="Square example image"> </a><br />
                    <big><strong><em>Note that clicking the link starts a brand new project!  Any work that the student has done prior to this link will NOT be available!!</em></strong></big>
                </li>
            </ol>
            Principles for when to include a script:
            <ul>
                <li>Early on, and for simple scripts (and minimal or no typing), getting them to build is useful practice.</li>
                <li>For complicated scripts that we want them to test and/or modify, let them load it.  Saves time and guarantees they're testing what we actually intended.</li>
                <li>For lists with lots of typing, let them load initial versions, especially for getting started or experiments.  Again, reduces overhead. Also, they can always tailor if they want.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        
        <h3>How<a name="cloud" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>to Load a Project NOT in Presentation with #cloud in the URL</h3>
        <div class="todo"><big><em><strong>Please note:</strong></em></big> In the following examples, Jens is using a direct link to his projects. <big><em><strong>Do not direct include links to your projects in the curriculum.</strong></em></big> Instead, follow the instructions just above that describe how to upload the XML file to /prog so that 1) other developers can edit it and 2) your changes to your own project file won't impact the curriculum.</div>
		<p>From Jens: you can use #cloud to open a shared project in edit mode without running it right away.</p>
        <p>There are also three switches you can add to the #present: url to get more control over what will be displayed:
			<ol>
				<li><code>&amp;editMode</code>: this will also NOT switch to presentation mode, but it will still run the project right away.</li>
                <ul><li><a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&ProjectName=Mesmerize&editMode" target="_blank">http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&amp;ProjectName=Mesmerize&amp;editMode</a></li></ul>
                <li><code>&amp;noRun</code>: this switch will prevent the project from running immediately (it won't fire the green flag event).</li>
                <ul>
                	<li>You can use it together with other switches, e.g. <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&ProjectName=Mesmerize&editMode&noRun" target="_blank">http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&amp;ProjectName=Mesmerize&amp;editMode&amp;noRun</a>.</li>
                    <li>but also alone: <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&ProjectName=Mesmerize&noRun" target="_blank">http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&amp;ProjectName=Mesmerize&amp;noRun</a></li>
                </ul>
                <li><code>&amp;hideControls</code>: this switch hides the green-flag, pause,  stop, and edit/presentation (useful for &quot;hiding&quot; the code) buttons. This is useful when embedding Snap projects into other web pages using iFrames. You can also use this in combination with other switches, but it makes the most sense in presentation mode.</li>
                <ul><li><a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&ProjectName=Mesmerize&hideControls" target="_blank">http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jens&amp;ProjectName=Mesmerize&amp;hideControls</a></li></ul>
			</ol>
        </p>

        <h3>How<a name="anchors" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a>to Link to a Specfic Part of a Page Using Anchors</h3>
        <p>
        	There are two parts of a link with an anchor (the link and the anchor):
			<ol>
                <li>
                    First, place the <strong>anchor</strong> on the target page:
                    <ul><li>
                        &lt;a name="picture" class="anchor"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;</li>
                        <li>Put that &amp;nbsp; (non-breaking space) in there, and use the whole thing (opening tag, &amp;nbsp; and closing tag) as a space, replacing some space in the line your want to link to.
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then, create a link, just like usual except add a hashtag and the anchor name to the end of the <strong>link</strong>: 
                    <ul><li>
                        For example: &lt;a href="/bjc-r/docs/style_guide.html#picture"&gt;This would link to the "How to Make a Picture of Blocks"&lt;/a&gt;, section above. <a href="/bjc-r/docs/style_guide.html#picture">Try it!</a>
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
			</ol>
        </p>
        <p>The #moveturn in the reference (a href) scrolls to that anchor (a name). (The anchor class is a workaround to scroll past the heading at the top of each lab page; it goes in the "a name" only; we hope to fix that one day.)</p>
        <p>Dreamweaver will maintain these links over time if you move and rename files in DW. Otherwise if you move or rename a files (outside DW) you will have to fix all the links yourself.</p>
