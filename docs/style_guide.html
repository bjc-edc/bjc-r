        	UCB has corrected me: 
            <ul>
            	<li>For the general text, leave things wrapped in "p" tags. Use "div" tags for any of the colorful styles below or for groups of multiplethings (like text and an image, etc.).</li>
                <li>Images <em>do not need</em> to be wrapped in "div" tags. Images can be placed on either side using class="imageRight" or class="imageLeft" in the "img" tag.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Indent code with 4 spaces (one tab) with each new level.</p>
        <p>Use &lt;span class="snap"&gt;snap&lt;/span&gt; to write <span class="snap">snap</span></p>

        <p>"Getting Started" is an optional (for us&mdash;it's required for students) <em>HTML page</em> at the beginning of each lab. "Take it Further" is a <em>page element</em> that we can (optionally) place at the end of each lab or wherever makes sense.</p>
        <p>You can now insert LaTeX using a double-dollar-sign delimiter... $$\| f + g \| \le \|f\|+\|g\|$$ </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            This is a made with a div within a div. The class of the surrounding div is "forYouToDo".<br />
            <ol>
                <li>To avoid having the title "For You To Do" appear several times on the same page, use id="first" for the first instance of class="forYouToDo" and not in the others. (Note: ID is used for something that only appears once; we are IDing that one as the first one.)</li>
                <li>Note that this second For You To Do also differs in that the &lt;ol&gt; tag has start="4" inside it so that the list starts in the right place.</li>
                <li>These are called "problems" (and not "exercises" or "tasks").</li>
                <li>Here are a bunch of icons you can use to say certain things that we will say over and over again (it's probably nice to have these on the right and to let the text wrap around them.):</li>

                <li>These next two have text in them that you get to add so it requires a little extra HTML. (<em>Be sure to edit both 1. the text in the span and 2. the alt and title text for the image.</em>)</li>

                <li>Alternatively, we can also use these mini icons since those are kinda big... You can use classes imageRight, imageLeft, or indent.</li>

            <br clear="all" />Here is a list of other formatting we can use:<br />
            <ol start="6">
                <li>
                    Use the "code" tag for <code>code</code>. Reference blocks (e.g. <code>pen down</code>) using the "code" tag or an image of the actual block: <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pen-down.png" class="block"/>. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Note: The <code>code</code> tag has been used all over the place in the previous version of BJC. Please try to keep it to only actual code blocks.</li>
                        <li>Re: variables and mathematics&mdash;If you are referencing a mathematical variable that you have made into a <span class="snap">snap</span> variable (hence, a block) then use the code tag (or an image of the block). If you are referencing the plus/minus/etc. block, use the code tag (or an image of the block). If you are just discussing a mathematical idea, then use regular notation: e.g. <em>x</em> + <em>y</em> = 7. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Syntax for <code>code</code> tags <em>and</em> alt/title text:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use parentheses for numerical or text inputs and square brackets for scripts (stacks of command blocks).</li>
                        <li>(When <em>naming</em> a block, as opposed to showing an invocation with inputs, just use the first word, e.g. <code>map</code> or <code>join</code>, unless this is ambiguous, e.g., the <code>go</code> block vs. the <code>go to x:y:</code> block.)</li>
                        <li>
                        	For example:
                            <ul>
								<div class="commentBig">I believe screen readers will correctly handle Unicode characters such as &#x21BB;  (or its Unicode equivalent  &amp;#x21BB;) so we can use that instead of "CW." -MF</div>                                 
								<li><code>repeat (4) [move (50) steps, turn &#x21BB; (90) degrees]</code></li>
                                <li>to reference a block: the <code>move</code> block</li>
                                <li>If absolutely necessary, use, e.g., "fill in the blank in <code>move () steps</code> below."</li>
                                <li>lists should be represented like this: <code>{apple, orange, banana}</code></li>
								<div class="todo">From BH: "The first time we use [braces], we should emphasize that that
isn't something you can type into Snap!.  And every so often (once per unit?) we should remind people by showing both the text and a picture."</div>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Do you have any examples that break or challenge this rule?</li>
                    </ul>                 
                </li>
                <li>Lists have items. not members or elements, because of the ITEM block.  And reporters report (not return) values.</li>
                <li>Use the "strong" tag for <strong>bold</strong>. Introduce <strong>new terms</strong> using the strong tag.</li>
                <li>Use the "em" tag for <em>italics</em>. The "em" tag is for <em>em</em>phasis.</li>
                <!-- block (code tag) vs. palette (quotes) vs. variable (italics, but even if block?) vs. new term (bold)-->
                <li>References to text in the app (such as the "OK" button or the "Motion" palette) should be in quotes.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="endnote">
            <div>Summary</div>
            Paul asked for this box (a div with class "endnote"). The idea is to use it for optional reading material that might summarize what they've been doing or for addtional, slightly off topic, but interesting material.
        </div>
        
        <p> 
        	Let's not use the following colored boxes at all:
        </p>
        <div class="alert quoteBlue">Blue Box - determine the meaning of these elements on a case by case basis and use one of our styles above instead.</div>
        <div class="alert quoteGreen">Green Box - use EDC version</div>
        <div class="alert quoteOrange">Orange Box - etc.</div>
        <div class="alert quoteYellow">Yellow Box - same thing ;)</div>
		<p>
        	(If we like the look, we can reintegrate them, but for now, let's change each one over to our own styles above. I asked, and these didn't have much specific meaning in previous BJC versions.)

(If it's a script or a block with inputs that is not likely to be used again, please store the image in the unit image directory; if it's a blank block or a block with default inputs, then it should go in the "blocks" image directory.)</li>

                <li>
                	In the lab page HTML file where you want to link, place a picture of the script wrapped with an "a href" tag linking to the XML file with class="run" in the "a href" tag. For example:<br />
                	<a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/loop/draw-a-square.xml"> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/prog-create-square-code-BYOB.gif" alt="Square example image" title="Square example image"> </a>

        </div>
        
        <h3><a name="anchors" class="anchor"></a>How to Link to a Specfic Part of a Page Using Anchors</h3>
        <p>
        	There are two parts of a link with an anchor (the link and the anchor):
            <ol>
                <li>
                    First, place the <strong>anchor</strong> on the target page:
                    <ul><li>
                        &lt;a name="picture" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</li>
                        <li>Put it at the start of the content about "picture" that you want to reference. (Note: do not put any content inside the opening and closing HTML tags or else it will be underlined.)
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then, create a link, just like usual except add a hashtag and the anchor name to the end of the <strong>link</strong>: 
                    <ul><li>
                        For example: &lt;a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/docs/style_guide.html#picture"&gt;This would link to the "How to Make a Picture of Blocks"&lt;/a&gt;, section above. <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/docs/style_guide.html#picture">Try it!</a>
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>The #moveturn in the reference (a href) scrolls to that anchor (a name). (The anchor class is a workaround to scroll past the heading at the top of each lab page; it goes in the "a name" only; we hope to fix that one day.)</p>
        <p>Dreamweaver will maintain these links over time if you move and rename files in DW. Otherwise if you move or rename a files (outside DW) you will have to fix all the links yourself.</p>
