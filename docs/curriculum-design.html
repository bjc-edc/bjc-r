<h2>BJC Curriculum Writing Guide</h2>

    <p>This document contains a collection of guidelines for writing <em>student-facing</em> pages for BJC.  It starts with the most important points and works downward to minor style details.</p>

<h3>1.	Experience before formality.</h3>
<p>This is a central design principle in BJC.  Explanations go in one eye and out the other unless the student has experienced the problem that the explanation is trying to solve.  In many cases, the activity will be enough to teach the idea without further explanation.  But if an explanation is needed, it goes <em>after</em> the activity.</p>
<p>Consider page 1.2.2 (that is, Unit 1, Lab 2, page 2).  It starts right off with things to do: load this starter project, try out some experiments.  Only after that is there a paragraph about abstraction.</p>

        <div class="takeNote">
            <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is the most fundamental idea in computer science, but it's hard to define until you've seen some examples.  The most basic kind of abstraction is to <em>give a name</em> to something in a program. For example, here we gave the name <code>who</code> to the idea "pick an item at random from this list of people (or cats)." This is called <strong><em>procedural</em> abstraction</strong> because we use a procedure (a block) to name the idea. This makes your code readable. You'll see other kinds of abstraction later.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
 <p>The overall structure of the lab (apart from page 1, which just introduces the idea of pair programming) is</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Page 2, experiment with opaque box procedures to see what they do.</li>
   <li>Page 3, edit the procedures to explore how they work in terms of primitive Snap<em>!</em> features.</li>
   <li>Page 4, write your own procedures.</li>
 </ul>
<p>This organization peels away levels of abstraction, from opaque box procedures to editable procedures to the ability to create new procedures. Not all labs follow this pattern, but when reading a lab, work out what pattern it does have.</p>
 <p>Page 1.2.4 unavoidably starts with a bunch of explanation about how to start building a block, but that text is embedded in an exercise in which students are building a particular block, so it feels like helping them past the details rather than feeling like arbitrary stuff they have to memorize.</p>
 <p>It's hard for teachers not to jump in with explanations. In BJC professional development we work hard on persuading teachers not to teach&mdash;that is, not to stand in front of the room explaining. It's just as hard for curriculum writers! But as you're editing your work, when you see a big pile of text, ask yourself &quot;isn't there an activity that could make this point?&quot;</p>
 <p>(By the way, Unit 1 Lab 1 is a special case, because it&rsquo;s not trying to teach how the program works; its goal is to get a finished game on the kids&rsquo; phones in the first class session, so they go home psyched.  So don&rsquo;t use it as an example of good curriculum writing.)</p>

<h3>2. Don't over-scaffold.</h3>
<p>We are teaching a wide range of students. Because BJC is an AP course, some students will come in expecting AP-level challenges. At the other extreme, some students will be recent immigrants not yet literate in English, or will have had very weak preparation in mathematics, and so will be unfamiliar with the use of a formal language. How can we meet the needs of all of this wide range of students?</p>
<p>The BJC solution to this problem is a heavy use of <em>hints,</em> which are levels of scaffolding normally invisible, with a short sentence like the following to announce them (1.3.2.5&mdash;Unit 1, Lab 3, page 2, problem 5):</p>
<div class="narrower">
<div class="endnote">
                        <a href="#hint-three-spoke" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a hint about drawing a three-spoke asterisk.">Click for a hint.</a>
                        <div id="hint-three-spoke" class="collapse">
                            <img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/3-point-asterisk.gif" alt="image of three spoke asterisk being drawn slowly with the sprite tracing out a different color in each third" title="image of three spoke asterisk being drawn slowly with the sprite tracing out a different color in each third" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    </div>
<p>Go ahead; click it. Then click on the stage picture to start the animation, and click again to stop it. </p>
<p>Note that the hint doesn't include any Snap<em>!</em> code! The animation is supposed to convey the idea that the code has to divide a full 360° circle into three equal parts. Some hints have a picture of a single Snap<em>!</em> block that should be helpful in carrying out the assigned task.</p>
<p>Here's the HTML code that generated that hint:</p>
<pre>&lt;div class="endnote">
    &lt;a href="#hint-three-spoke" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a hint about drawing a three-spoke asterisk.">Click for a hint.&lt;/a>
    &lt;div id="hint-three-spoke" class="collapse">
        &lt;img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/3-point-asterisk.gif" alt="image of three spoke asterisk being drawn slowly with the sprite tracing out a different color in each third" title="image of three spoke asterisk being drawn slowly with the sprite tracing out a different color in each third" />
    &lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
</pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;div class="endnote"></code> makes the yellow box; the <code>&lt;img ...</code> line makes the animation.  Here is just the essential code about hints:
<pre>
    &lt;a href="#<b>unique-name</b>" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a hint.">Click for a hint.&lt;/a>
    &lt;div id="<b>unique-name</b>" class="collapse">
    Hint text goes here.
    &lt;/div>
</pre>
You can copy and paste this code into your curriculum pages.  The text <code>unique-name</code> should be replaced by any name that is not used in other hints on the same page (the same name in both places).</p>

<p>Don't focus on the HTML details. The important thing is that you should write the visible curriculum for the <em>good, successful </em>students first, and <em>then</em> use hints as necessary to add scaffolding for the weaker students. In some cases we've put hints inside hints (2.4.2.4):</p>

<div class="narrower">
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
                <li>
                    <div class="ap-standard">AAP-2.M parts a and b</div>
                    Develop a <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/number-of-divisors.png" alt="number of divisors reporter with numeric input slot" title="number of divisors reporter with numeric input slot"> block (using <code>keep</code>), and use it to answer these questions:

                    </ul><br />
                    You can do this on your own or follow <a href="#hint-steps" data-toggle="collapse" title="the steps for building the 'number of divisors' block">these steps.</a>

                                            <li>You <em>could</em> build this with <code>mod</code>, but you already built <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/divisible-by.png" alt="() divisible by () ?" title="() divisible by () ?" /> (using <code>mod</code>), so <code>divisible by?</code> will be simpler to use.</li>

                            <li>
                                Build a <code>number of divisors</code> block.<br />
                                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/number-of-divisors-9-reporting.png" alt="number of divisors (9) reporting 3" title="number of divisors (9) reporting 3" />

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Build an expression using <code>keep</code> to answer each of these questions that were introduced above:
                                <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                                    <li><strong>What kinds of numbers have an odd number of divisors?</strong></li>
                                    <li><strong>What kinds of numbers have exactly two divisors?</strong></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </li>
			</ol>
        </div>
</div>

<p>Note that the outer hint text doesn't say &quot;hint&quot;; it just says &quot;these steps.&quot;  But by this point in the course, students have learned how hints work. In presenting this problem, we've decided that there will be students who can't, on their own, put all the pieces together to make <code>number of divisors</code> on their own, but who <em>can</em> make the simpler <code>divisors of</code> block on their own. But some students may need help even with that. (If you nest hints, don't forget that the outer hint and the inner hint must have different names.)</p>
<p>Our expectations for students increase over time. Hinted scaffolding in Unit 1 may go down to the level of suggesting a partial script, or a complete script but with some inputs missing. But in later units we expect students to be able to use hints that are less step-by-step.</p>
<p>Always remember that our long-term goal is that every student be able to create an original program <em>without help.</em> So it's important to reduce students' dependence on hints. You aren't doing the students a favor if you write curriculum that tells them exactly what script to build.</p>
<p>What about the students at the other extreme, the ones for whom this course is too easy? We address their needs in the &quot;Take It Further&quot; activities. We do not expect every BJC student to be able to solve these problems, even after the entire year is over.  But the students who complain that the course is boring should enjoy them. A TIF may involve mathematical analysis beyond the level of preparation we expect of all students, or it may be a substantial programming problem with no scaffolding.</p>
<p>&quot;Take It Further&quot; is different from &quot;If There Is Time.&quot; Those problems aren't harder than the ones in the main text; they're just different and not essential. If some kids finish a page early, but aren't Take It Further-type kids, teachers can have them work on these. Both kinds of optional problems are behind hint links, to reduce the length of the pages.</p>
<p>Another, different kind of scaffolding for more interested students is that we sometimes use hint boxes to go into deeper detail about some issue, not required content for BJC but perhaps of interest to some students.</p>
<h3>3. We are telling a story.</h3>
<p>Well, two stories, actually.  One story, easily forgotten in the heat of writing an activity we ourselves might enjoy, is that all students, especially ones from underrepresented groups, can succeed at computer science and enjoy programming.  The differentiated learning of hidden hints and "Take It Further" activities helps tell this story.  It's important also to be sensitive to activities that might repel specific groups of students.  The original version of BJC for UC Berkeley students had a lab asking students to build a program to play Hangman, the word-guessing game; it wasn't until we started working with New York City schools that one of our collaborators there pointed out the connection with the lynching of Blacks in the post-Reconstruction South.  (We have, however, resisted what we see as erring in the opposite direction, by writing activities of interest <em>only</em> to a particular group.)</p>
<p>But our main story is about computer science, specifically about <em>abstraction</em> and about <em>functional programming.</em>  The history of computer science has consisted of the layering of abstraction over abstraction.  In some early computers, program memory was on a magnetic drum; by the time each machine instruction was completed, the drum had rotated past the next storage location, so if program instructions were in consecutive locations, the machine would have to wait almost a complete rotation before the next instruction could run.  To avoid that, the programmer had to look up the exact time required for each instruction, and put the next instruction in the location on the drum that would be coming under the magnetic head just as the previous instruction was completed.  In the 75 years or so of computer science, more and more of the ugly details of computer technology have been handled by the computer itself, so that programmers can more nearly <em>forget about computers</em> and think only about the problem they want the computer to solve.</p>
<p>It's ironic that so many high school computer science teachers are so enthusiastic about teaching about binary numerals; no working computer programmer ever deals with binary!  Computer science isn't about binary; it's about all the abstractions that stand between the human programmer and binary.  It's electrical engineers, the people who design the actual computer hardware, who think about binary.</p>
<p>Functional programming is a style of programming based on the computation of functions.  A function takes some number of inputs and reports a result; <em>the result depends only on the input values, not on any previous computation.</em>
<h3>4. Emphasize social implications.</h3>
<p>I lied; we're telling <em>three</em> stories.  The third one is that it very much matters <em>what people do</em> with computers.  Are you writing curriculum about robots?  Be sure to integrate study of the effect of automation on jobs, and study of drones as weapons, in with the technical labs.  Don't leave it for the end of the course.  (Actually both of these topics are already in BJC, but you might think about moving them closer to relevant technical topics.)  Here are some of the main points of this story:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's traditional to pose social issues in terms of benefits and risks, as if everyone had the same interests.  But that's very much not the case.  Google is <em>not</em> your friend.  It's important to ask, "<em>who</em> benefits?"  "<em>Who</em> is at risk?"</li>
<li>We emphasize the problematic social implications of computing, not because it's all problematic but because the good parts of computing take care of themselves; it's the problems that require informed citizen action.  The daily Computing in the News activity is an opportunity to describe briefly, but repeatedly, what good things computers are doing.</li>
<li>Don't assume that law and ethics coincide.  For example, look at the lab about copyright.  We clarify that "copyright" isn't really a <em>right</em>, and that "intellectual property" isn't meant to be <em>property.</em>  In particular, don't exhort students to behave in a particular way ("Don't pirate movies!"); make <em>them</em> work out how to support artists in the digital age.</li>
<li>When the media pose a yes-or-no question, look for a third way, not a compromise that satisfies neither side, but a <em>synthesis</em> that respects the goals behind the two alleged choices.  We do this, for example, in discussing the rescue of Tanya Ryder in the privacy lab.</li>
<li>Try not to leave students feeling hopeless and depressed.  This is tricky, because we definitely don't want to lie to students, and some things really <em>do</em> seem hopeless and depressing.  One lie often told to students is that when they grow up and become professional programmers they can change the course of history by refusing to work on bad projects.  But in the rare occasions when that happens, as when Google employees organized against the company bidding on a US government project to build a huge database of photos matched with names, the contract just went to Amazon instead.  And Google did bid on the <em>next</em> terrible project.  It's much more as citizens than as programmers that people can affect the future.</li>
<li>We teach students how to keep their computers safe from malware.  But we also teach that <em>this should not be their responsibility.</em>  In this matter, governments should act on our behalf.  The same is true about privacy; students shouldn't post their birthdates online, but in a better world they'd be able to do so safely, because governments would impose strict criminal penalties for using information provided by individuals for any purpose other than the one for which the person gave the information.  If Google or Facebook or Amazon remembers your search queries to target advertising to you, their officers and directors should go to prison.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Use functional programming where possible.</h3>
<p>This is one of the ways in which BJC is better than the College Board's CSP Framework.  Instead of thinking of a program as a sequence of steps, we try to think of it as a <em>composition of functions.</em>  So, instead of<br />
<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/sequential-name.png" alt="set (contact) to (item 3 of contact-list); set (name) to (name from contact (contact)); say (name) for 2 secs" title="set (contact) to (item 3 of contact-list); set (name) to (name from contact (contact)); say (name) for 2 secs" /><br />
we would write<br />
<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/functional-name.png" alt="say (name from contact (item 3 of contact-list)) for 2 secs" title="say (name from contact (item 3 of contact-list)) for 2 secs" />
<p>Functional programming is more powerful than sequential programming, in part because a function you write can be used as a helper in a larger computation.  Compare these:</p>
<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/sequential-square.png" alt="script variables (number); ask "What number should I square?" and wait; set (number) to (answer); say (number * number) for 2 secs" title="script variables (number); ask "What number should I square?" and wait; set (number) to (answer); say (number * number) for 2 secs" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/functional-square.png" alt="define square of (number): report (number * number)" title="define square of (number): report (number * number)" />
<p>Especially for kids who've programmed before, the first of these may look like a "real program," while the second seems so trivial as to be "cheating."  But what if I want to know 3<sup>4</sup>?  With the functional version I can say<br />
<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/3-to-the-4.png" alt="(square of (square of (3))) reporting 81" title="(square of (square of (3))) reporting 81" />
<p>But with the sequential version, I'm out of luck.</p>
<p>Some people find composition confusing because the expression is evaluated from the inside out.  If you're one of those, we provide an alternate notation (in the "iteration, composition" library) in which the procedure calls appear in the order in which they're evaluated:<br />
<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/2x-square-3.png" alt="pipe 3 -> square of () -> 2 * (), reports 18" title="pipe 3 -> square of () -> 2 * (), reports 18" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/square-2x3.png" alt="pipe 3 -> (2 * ()) -> (square of ()), reports 36" title="pipe 3 -> (2 * ()) -> (square of ()), reports 36" /></p>
<p>Two other reasons why functional programming is important, not so obvious in the toy problems of the programming labs, is that it helps prevent bugs (by avoiding changing the value of a variable, so one piece of the program can't step on a value that another part still needs) and that the advent of parallelism in computer hardware is much easier to put to use when each of a bunch of expressions can be evaluated without reference to any other of them.</p>
<p>We aren't fanatical about it, though.  Even drawing pictures can be done functionally; a picture is built up as a data structure full of line segments, and when a picture function is called at toplevel, the result is the picture, shown on the stage.  But that's not the <em>natural</em> way to draw pictures, and we use the graphics projects as an opportunity to show students how sequential programs work.</p>
<p>But even then, we try to avoid <em>changing</em> the value of a variable, and when we must, we provide abstractions over the reassignment, such as the <code>for</code> and <code>for each</code> blocks.</p>
<h3>6. Be careful about the use of the word "optional."</h3>
<p>In every unit there is a collection of  &quot;optional projects&quot; after the numbered labs. These are optional in the sense that they are not essential to telling our story. Students who want to do more programming than we're requiring of them are encouraged to take up some of these suggested projects. Note that <em>some</em> of these are former BJC labs that became redundant as the curriculum evolved, but that many teachers love. So some teachers will assign some of these projects, in which case they're optional for the teacher but no longer optional for the student.</p>
<p>Apart from those, <em>nothing in the curriculum is optional,</em> not for students and not for teachers either. Saying that in a more positive way, every page of every lab teaches something we consider important. There's no busywork. (Within a page, <em>If There Is Time</em> and <em>Take It Further</em> sections <em>are </em>optional.) Having said that, teachers new to BJC often report that they have trouble fitting everything into the school year, and in the Teacher's Guide we give them guidance about the least harmful labs to omit. Teachers loosely refer to these labs as &quot;optional,&quot; but that shouldn't be our attitude toward them, and in particular there should be no hint of optionality in <em>student-facing</em> materials.</p>
<p>(One reason that teachers new to BJC have trouble fitting the curriculum into the year is that they don't believe us about not standing in front of the room showing PowerPoint slides. We urge them to start each class with just five minutes of &quot;Computers in the News,&quot; reading one or two stories to the class from that day's newspaper about computers saving the world or computers violating privacy; the point is that there <em>are</em> such stories every day, without fail. But after that, students should be in the habit of getting right to work on the next lab without prompting from the teacher. This means that we don't, in the Teacher's Guide, tell teachers what to teach; they shouldn't be teaching, in that sense, at all. What's in the TG are tips about pitfalls that students are likely to fall into, so that as the teacher looks over shoulders they can be ready to help out. What this means to curriculum writers is that <em>the lab has to teach itself.</em> Everything a student needs to know has to be presented in the lab, preferably by activities that teach rather than by text that lectures.)</p>
<p>Yet another sense of &quot;optional&quot; is that the actual AP exam comes at the end of Unit 5. Units 6&ndash;8 come after the high-stakes part of the course is over. Students in AP classes generally expect to be able to goof off after AP exam season in May. But these later units contain some of the high points of our story line, especially about recursion. So our stance should be that students will continue to take the course seriously until the very end.</p>
<h3>7. Common errors of fact.</h3>
<p>There is no such thing as a &quot;binary number.&quot; (Yes, the code.org videos have this wrong.) A number is a quantity, regardless of how it's represented. The number four is four oranges, or four computers, or four pencils. In order to talk about numbers, we have to represent them somehow. A number representation may be a picture of four oranges, or it can be tally marks with a slash every fifth count, it can be Roman numerals, or it can be positional notation with respect to some base, such as binary or decimal. So there are &quot;binary numerals&quot; and &quot;decimal numerals&quot; as different representations for the same underlying number.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as &quot;converting from binary to decimal&quot; or vice versa. The algorithms people label with those names are actually converting <em>from a numeral to a number</em> or <em>from a number to a numeral.</em> What leads to confusion on this point is that computers typically use decimal numerals in presenting numbers to human beings and in reading numbers from human beings. But what's inside the computer is a number. (This is an abstraction; of course what's inside the computer is also a representation. But it's not a string of digit characters, and at the software level of abstraction it's a number.)</p>
<p>The AP CSP Framework says repeatedly that programs are built out of sequences, repetitions/loops, and conditionals. This leaves out procedure calls, a much more important building block for interesting programs. Students have to know how to answer the test questions, but they shouldn't think that those questions have anything to do with reality.</p>
<h3>8 Common style violations.</h3>
<p>Do not use the word "fun" or synonyms.  (Exception: In a game-building project, you can say "The game will be more fun to play if..." talking about <em>a third party</em> having fun while playing the game.)  Do not use exclamation points, except in the name of Snap<em>!.</em>  When we tell students that something will be fun or exciting, they read "fun" as "boring."  We should strive to make the activities fun, but we should let students decide for themselves whether they're having fun, not engage in self-advertising.  Students will see through that. (This is an absolute prohibition for BJC curriculum writers. One exclamation point in a unit is one too many.)</p>

<p>Do not use &quot;we&quot; or "let's" in sentences about what students will do in an activity: &quot;We need to make a list...&quot; The students are called &quot;you.&quot; We (curriculum writers) aren't doing the activity; you (students) are. &quot;We&quot; in that context is a phony attempt at solidarity. As in the case of &quot;fun,&quot; we should <em>act</em> in solidarity with students, but we shouldn't make the claim. &quot;We&quot; can be used <em>very sparingly</em> in explaining editorial decisions: &quot;We could have said... but...&quot; For the most part, though, we don't need to tell students why we wrote in a certain way; the subject of the curriculum is computer science, not us. Instead of  &quot;We have provided...&quot; say &quot;The project starter file provides...&quot;</p>
<p>Orange &quot;takeNote&quot; boxes are for crucial, deep, central computer science ideas, the ones we want students to remember two years from now. Don't overuse them. (Early in BJC development we didn't have a clear idea of what orange boxes were for, so some of the earlier-written activities don't follow this rule, but we're trying to catch and fix those cases.)</p>
<p>The general rule is that text on a white background is required reading; text on a colored background is optional reading. This is why most hints are in yellow boxes. Be sure not to yellow-box (sidenote or endnote) something they really need in order to continue in the activity. Note in particular that Vocabulary and On the AP Exam boxes are on a gray background because students don't have to read them as they're doing the activity; they are meant for review on a second reading before a BJC assessment or before the AP exam. An implication of this is that some things in Vocabulary boxes will duplicate white-background text, perhaps in different words.</p>
<p>Things students have to do are in green-bordered boxes. Text outside of green boxes is explanation. Our experience is that many students skip over text that isn't part of an activity, especially long blocks of text. This is one reason we try to minimize explanation. (See &quot;experience before formality&quot; above.) But don't cheat by just moving the explanatory text inside a green box! The text in a green box has to be truly related to something the students have to do. The goal is to replace explanatory text with activities that demonstrate what you want to explain.</p>
<p>The name &quot;Snap<em>!</em>&quot; is capital S, the rest lower case, with an <em>italic</em> exclamation point. That exclamation point is like a letter in the name, not punctuation for the sentence: &quot;You will program this animation in Snap<em>!</em>.&quot; If you were going to end a sentence with an exclamation point (which you're not), it'd look like &quot;Isn't it cool that you can use Snap<em>!</em>!&quot; This way of spelling the name follows the logo:<img src="/bjc-r/img/splash-page/snap-logo-large.png" width=48" alt="Snap! logo">.</p>
