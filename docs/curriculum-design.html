<h2>BJC Curriculum Writing Guide</h2>
        
    <p>This document contains a collection of guidelines for writing <em>student-facing</em> pages for BJC.  It starts with the most important points and works downward to minor style details.</p>

<h3>1.	Experience before formality.</h3>
<p>This is a central design principle in BJC.  Explanations go in one eye and out the other unless the student has experienced the problem that the explanation is trying to solve.  In many cases, the activity will be enough to teach the idea without further explanation.  But if an explanation is needed, it goes <em>after</em> the activity.</p>
<p>Consider page 1.2.2 (that is, Unit 1, Lab 2, page 2).  It starts right off with things to do: load this starter project, try out some experiments.  Only after that is there a paragraph about abstraction.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is the most fundamental idea in computer science, but it's hard to define until you've seen some examples.  The most basic kind of abstraction is to <em>give a name</em> to something in a program. For example, here we gave the name <code>who</code> to the idea "pick an item at random from this list of people (or cats)." This is called <strong><em>procedural</em> abstraction</strong> because we use a procedure (a block) to name the idea. This makes your code readable. You'll see other kinds of abstraction later.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
 <p>The overall structure of the lab (apart from page 1, which just introduces the idea of pair programming) is</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Page 2, experiment with black box procedures to see what they do.</li>
   <li>Page 3, edit the procedures to explore how they work in terms of primitive Snap<em>!</em> features.</li>
   <li>Page 4, write your own procedures.</li>
 </ul>
<p>This organization peels away levels of abstraction, from black box procedures to editable procedures to the ability to create new procedures.</p>
 <p>Page 1.2.4 unavoidably starts with a bunch of explanation about how to start building a block, but that text is embedded in an exercise in which students are building a particular block, so it feels like helping them past the details rather than feeling like arbitrary stuff they have to memorize.</p>
 <p>It's hard for teachers not to jump in with explanations. In BJC professional development we work hard on persuading teachers not to teach&amp;mdash;that is, not to stand in front of the room explaining. It's just as hard for curriculum writers! But as you're editing your work, when you see a big pile of text, ask yourself &quot;isn't there an activity that could make this point?&quot;</p>
 <p>(By the way, Unit 1 Lab 1 is a special case, because it&rsquo;s not trying to teach how the program works; its goal is to get a finished game on the kids&rsquo; phones in the first class session, so they go home psyched.  So don&rsquo;t use it as an example of good curriculum writing.)</p>

<h3>2. Don't over-scaffold.</h3>
<p>We are teaching a wide range of students. Because BJC is an AP course, some students will come in expecting AP-level challenges. At the other extreme, some students will be recent immigrants not yet literate in English, or will have had very weak preparation in mathematics, and so will be unfamiliar with the use of a formal language. How can we meet the needs of all of this wide range of students?</p>
<p>The BJC solution to this problem is a heavy use of <em>hints,</em> which are levels of scaffolding normally invisible, with a short sentence like the following to announce them (1.3.2.5&mdash;Unit 1, Lab 3, page 2, problem 5):</p>
<div class="narrower">
<div class="endnote">
                        <a href="#hint-three-spoke" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a hint about drawing a three-spoke asterisk.">Click for a hint.</a>
                        <div id="hint-three-spoke" class="collapse">
                            <img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/3-point-asterisk.gif" alt="image of three spoke asterisk being drawn slowly with the sprite tracing out a different color in each third" title="image of three spoke asterisk being drawn slowly with the sprite tracing out a different color in each third" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    </div>
<p>Go ahead; click it. Then click on the stage picture to start the animation, and click again to stop it. </p>
<p>Note that the hint doesn't include any Snap<em>!</em> code! The animation is supposed to convey the idea that the code has to divide a full 360° circle into three equal parts. Some hints have a picture of a single Snap<em>!</em> block that should be helpful in carrying out the assigned task.</p>
<p>Here's the HTML code that generated that hint:</p>
<pre>&lt;div class="endnote">
    &lt;a href="#hint-three-spoke" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a hint about drawing a three-spoke asterisk.">Click for a hint.&lt;/a>
    &lt;div id="hint-three-spoke" class="collapse">
        &lt;img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/3-point-asterisk.gif" alt="image of three spoke asterisk being drawn slowly with the sprite tracing out a different color in each third" title="image of three spoke asterisk being drawn slowly with the sprite tracing out a different color in each third" />
    &lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
</pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;div class="endnote"></code> makes the yellow box; the <code>&lt;img ...</code> line makes the animation.  Here is just the essential code about hints:
<pre>
    &lt;a href="#<b>unique-name</b>" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a hint.">Click for a hint.&lt;/a>
    &lt;div id="<b>unique-name</b>" class="collapse">
    Hint text goes here.                     
    &lt;/div>
</pre>
You can copy and paste this code into your curriculum pages.  The text <code>unique-name</code> should be replaced by any name that is not used in other hints on the same page (the same name in both places).</p>

<p>Don't focus on the HTML details. The important thing is that you should write the visible curriculum for the <em>good, successful </em>students first, and <em>then</em> use hints as necessary to add scaffolding for the weaker students. In some cases we've put hints inside hints (2.4.2.4):</p>

<div class="narrower">

                                            <li>You <em>could</em> build this with <code>mod</code>, but you already built <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/divisible-by.png" alt="() divisible by () ?" title="() divisible by () ?" /> (using <code>mod</code>), so <code>divisible by?</code> will be simpler to use.</li>

                                Build a <code>number of divisors</code> block.<br />
                                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/number-of-divisors-9-reporting.png" alt="number of divisors (9) reporting 3" title="number of divisors (9) reporting 3" />

                            <li>
                                Build an expression using <code>keep</code> to answer each of these questions that were introduced above:
                                <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                                    <li><strong>What kinds of numbers have an odd number of divisors?</strong></li>
                                    <li><strong>What kinds of numbers have exactly two divisors?</strong></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </li>
			</ol>
        </div>
</div>

<p>Note that the outer hint text doesn't say &quot;hint&quot;; it just says &quot;these steps.&quot;  But by this point in the course, students have learned how hints work. In presenting this problem, we've decided that there will be students who can't, on their own, put all the pieces together to make <code>number of divisors</code> on their own, but who <em>can</em> make the simpler <code>divisors of</code> block on their own. But some students may need help even with that. (If you nest hints, don't forget that the outer hint and the inner hint must have different names.)</p>
<p>Our expectations for students increase over time. Hinted scaffolding in Unit 1 may go down to the level of suggesting a partial script, or a complete script but with some inputs missing. But in later units we expect students to be able to use hints that are less step-by-step.</p>
<p>Always remember that our long-term goal is that every student be able to create an original program without help. In fact students do this in pairs, but you shouldn't allow pairings in which one student does all the work. So it's important to reduce students' dependence on hints. Make it clear that <em>every</em> student should try to do every problem <em>without</em> the hint, and click on it only if after an honest effort they're still stuck.</p>
<p>What about the students at the other extreme, the ones for whom this course is too easy? We address their needs in the &quot;Take It Further&quot; activities. Don't assign these to the entire class; they're genuinely hard. We do not expect every BJC student to be able to solve these problems, even after the entire year is over.  But the students who complain that the course is boring will enjoy them.</p>
<p>&quot;Take It Further&quot; is different from &quot;If There Is Time.&quot; Those problems aren't harder than the ones in the main text; they're just different and not essential. If some kids finish a page early, but aren't Take It Further-type kids, you can have them work on these. Both kinds of optional problems are behind hint links, to reduce the length of the pages.</p>
<p>Another, different kind of scaffolding for more interested students is that we sometimes use hint boxes to go into deeper detail about some issue, not required content for BJC but perhaps of interest to some students.</p>
<p>To the extent possible, we'd like to leave it up to individual students to decide which hint boxes, if any, to expand.</p>
<h3>3. Emphasize social implications.</h3>
<h3>4. Use functional programming where possible.</h3>
<h3>5. Common errors of fact.</h3>
<p>There is no such thing as a &quot;binary number.&quot; (Yes, the code.org videos have this wrong.) A number is a quantity, regardless of how it's represented. The number four is four oranges, or four computers, or four pencils. In order to talk about numbers, we have to represent them somehow. A number representation may be a picture of four oranges, or it can be tally marks with a slash every fifth count, it can be Roman numerals, or it can be positional notation with respect to some base, such as binary or decimal. So there are &quot;binary numerals&quot; and &quot;decimal numerals&quot; as different representations for the same underlying number.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as &quot;converting from binary to decimal&quot; or vice versa. The algorithms people label with those names are actually converting <em>from a numeral to a number</em> or <em>from a number to a numeral.</em> What leads to confusion on this point is that computers typically use decimal numerals in presenting numbers to human beings and in reading numbers from human beings. But what's inside the computer is a number. (This is an abstraction; of course what's inside the computer is also a representation. But it's not a string of digit characters, and at the software level of abstraction it's a number.)</p>
<p>The AP CSP Framework says repeatedly that programs are built out of sequences, repetitions/loops, and conditionals. This leaves out procedure calls, a much more important building block for interesting programs. Students have to know how to answer the test questions, but they shouldn't think that those questions have anything to do with reality.</p>
<h3>6. Common style violations.</h3>
<p>Do not use the word "fun" or synonyms.  (Exception: In a game project, you can say "The game will be more fun to play if..." talking about a third party having fun while using the project.)  Do not use exclamation points, except in the name of Snap<em>!.</em>  When we tell students that something will be fun or exciting, they read "fun" as "boring."  We should strive to make the activities fun, but we should let students decide for themselves whether they're having fun, not engage in self-advertising.  Students will see through that.</p>

<p>Do not use &quot;we&quot; in sentences about what students will do in an activity: &quot;We need to make a list...&quot; The students are &quot;you.&quot; We curriculum writers aren't doing the activity; you students are. &quot;We&quot; in that context is a phony attempt at solidarity. As for &quot;fun,&quot; we should <em>act</em> in solidarity with students, but we shouldn't make the claim. &quot;We&quot; should be used <em>very sparingly</em> in explaining editorial decisions: &quot;We could have said... but...&quot; For the most part, we don't need to tell students why we wrote in a certain way; the subject of the curriculum is computer science, not us. Instead of  &quot;We have provided...&quot; say &quot;The project starter file provides...&quot;</p>
<p>Orange &quot;takeNote&quot; boxes are for crucial, deep, central computer science ideas, the ones we want students to remember two years from now. Don't overuse them. (Early in BJC development we didn't have a clear idea of what orange boxes were for, so some of the earlier-written activities don't follow this rule, but we're trying to catch and fix those cases.)</p>
<p>The general rule is that text on a white background is required reading; text on a colored background is optional reading. This is why most hints are in yellow boxes. Be sure not to yellow-box (sidenote or endnote) something they really need to continue in the activity. Note in particular that Vocabulary and On the AP Exam boxes are on a gray background because students don't have to read them as they're doing the activity; they are meant for review on a second reading before a BJC assessment or before the AP exam. An implication of this is that some things in Vocabulary boxes will duplicate white-background text, perhaps in different words.</p>
<p>Things students have to do are in green boxes. Text outside of green boxes is explanation of the ideas of the lab. Our experience is that many students skip over text that isn't part of an activity, especially long blocks of text. This is why we try to minimize explanation. (See &quot;experience before formality&quot; above.) But don't cheat by just moving the explanatory text inside a green box! The text in a green box has to be truly related to something the students have to do. The goal is to replace explanatory text with activities that demonstrate what you want to explain.</p>
