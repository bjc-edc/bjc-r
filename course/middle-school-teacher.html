        <h2>Beauty and Joy of Computing Sparks Teacher Guide</h2>
        <p>BJC Sparks is a middle school and early high school computer science curriculum being developed by the University of California, Berkeley, and Education Development Center, Inc. In a 2021-2022, a small group of teachers ran a pilot test of the curriculum to inform changes for the 2022-2023 school year, and a second cohort of teachers is providing feedback this year.</p>
		<p>Building on our lessons learned creating the Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (CSP) <a href="http://bjc.edc.org/" title="Beauty and Joy of Computing curriculum for high school" target="_blank">Beauty and Joy of Computing curriculum for high school</a>, these new materials use the <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/" title="Snap! programming language" target="_blank">Snap<em>!</em> programming language</a> (an easy-to-learn blocks-based programming language based on Scratch), take a functional-programming first approach to introductory computer science, and are being developed to meet the <a href="https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards" title="CSTA standards" target="_blank">CSTA standards</a> for middle school as well as some of the early high school standards.</p>
		
		<div class="todo">Next year: include a teacher guide intro that has a description of the color coding in the CSS. --MF</div>
