        <h2>Welcome to the Beauty and Joy of Computing, <em>BJC</em> Professional Development</h2>
    
<!--         <p>In this course, you will <em>create</em> apps and other programs using the <span class="snap">snap</span>  programming language, you will  learn some of the most <em>powerful ideas</em> of computer science, you will be <em>creative</em>, and  you will discuss the social implications of computing, thinking deeply about how <em>you</em> can be personally active in promoting the benefits and reducing the possible harms. </p>
        <p><em>You are among the first in the nation to be doing this.</em></p>
    	<p>The BJC4NYC project is adapting the University of California, Berkeley's introductory computer science course as a high school <a href="https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-principles" target="_blank">AP CS Principles</a> course. Over the years 2015-2018, BJC will be introduced to 100 NYC high schools. Your comments, corrections, and other feedback are valuable and will help  to improve this course.  </p>

        <p><strong>This is an excerpt from the full BJC course, for use only during  a professional development workshop.</strong></p>
        <p>For six-week workshops:<strong> You will use this mini-course only in the first face-to-face week. In the following weeks, you will study these units again, in their complete form.</strong>  </p>
        <p>For three-week workshops: <strong>You will use this mini-course throughout the workshop. You will study the complete units during the school year, on your own and in webinars.</strong></p>
        <p>You are expected to come out of <em>this</em> experience with an understanding of the breadth of the course, not of each unit in depth.</p>
