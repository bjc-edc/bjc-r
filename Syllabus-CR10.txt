Curricular Requirement 10 
The course provides a minimum of three opportunities for students to investigate different computing innovations.

Computing Innovation 1, Prompt A:
Unit 4, Lab 3, Page 6, Exercise 3:
Pick another computing innovation (whether in the arts, science, or solving a practical problem), and write about its original purpose and unintended consequences. What was it designed for in the first place? What were the consequences, how were they missed in the design of the innovation, and how did the designers respond when they appeared? Make a chart like the Facebook example above.  [A two-by-two chart with axes good/bad, intended/unintended.]


Computing Innovation 2, Prompt B:
Unit 5, Lab 3, Page 4, Exercise 5:
Pick a computing innovation that uses a lot of data. Write about what kinds of data it uses, where those data come from, and how the application transforms the data to extract information.


Computing Innovation 3, Prompt C:
Unit 1, Lab 4, Page 4, Exercise 6:
Pick a computing innovation (a web site, a payment method like Paypal, an online indirect login manager like "log in via Google," etc.) and explain privacy concerns that it raises.
