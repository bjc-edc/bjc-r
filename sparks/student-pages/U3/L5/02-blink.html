        <h3>micro:bit Set-up</h3>
        <p>Before writing code in MicroBlocks, set up your micro:bit on a piece of paper. Use two pieces of copper tape to make your connections. One piece of tape will start at <strong>pin 0</strong> and the other will start at <strong>GND</strong>.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>Place two pieces of copper tape on the micro:bit on a piece of paper.</li>

            </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>Test Code</h3>
        <p>Test your set up by adding an LED with the following starting code. Make sure that the positive side of the battery is connected to <strong>pin 0</strong> and the negative side of the LED is connected to <strong>GND</strong>.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="2">
                <li>Add an LED to your copper tape circuit and test that it turns on with this example code.</li>

            </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>Blink Code</h3>
        <p>After testing that your LED turns on, you'll modify to the code so it blinks on and off. The code from the test uses a block <code>set digital pin ... to ...</code> which controls when electrical current is sent into a specified pin. Choose which pin to send current (0, 1, or 2) and whether there should be current (green toggle for on, red toggle for off).</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="3">
                <li>Modify the test code to turn the LED on and off.</li>

                <li>Test with micro:bit by plugging it into your computer. <a href="#hint-drop" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a video of blinking LED">Click for a video.</a>
                <div id="hint-drop" class="collapse"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L5/blink-2x.gif" alt="blinking LED" title="blinking LED" height="250"></div></li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="ifTime show">
            Explore other blink patterns. Create custom on-and-off sequences using the <code>set digital pin</code> block. Once you have a custom blink pattern, use one of the micro:bit inputs from a previous lab to start turn on your light.
