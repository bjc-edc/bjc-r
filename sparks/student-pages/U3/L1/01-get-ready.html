		<title>Unit 3 Lab 1: Meet micro:bit, Activity 1</title>
	</head>

		<h2>Get Ready</h2>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>I'd like to rename this something like "Setting Up Your micro:bit." I'd also like to consider breaking this into multiple pages: "Using the Display Block" and "Saving Your Project" seem like they could each stand alone, if not also "Adding Blocks," which I'd like to rename "Adding a Library" and cover some of the library standard there. --MF, 3/16/22</p>
			<p><strong>2-AP-16: Incorporate existing code, media, and libraries into original programs, and give attribution.</strong> Building on the work of others enables students to produce more interesting and powerful creations. Students should use portions of code, algorithms, and/or digital media in their own programs and websites. At this level, they may also import libraries and connect to web application program interfaces (APIs). For example, when creating a side-scrolling game, students may incorporate portions of code that create a realistic jump movement from another person's game, and they may also import Creative Commons-licensed images to use in the background. Students should give attribution to the original creators to acknowledge their contributions.</p>
			<p>MARY TODO: go through U3 workshop notes and add any suggestions about trouble-shooting that we ran into in the PD. --MF, 3/16/22</p>

		<h3>Collect Materials</h3>

						<li>USB cable</li>
						<li>Battery pack (optional)</li>
					</ul>

		<h3>Set Up Your micro:bit with MicroBlocks</h3>
		<p>
			For this unit, you'll use a program called MicroBlocks, a Snap<em>!</em>-like programming language designed to control tools like micro:bit.<br />

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>
					Open <a class="" href="https://microblocks.fun/run/microblocks.html" title="MicroBlocks" target="_blank">MicroBlocks</a> in a Chrome browser.
					<div class="endnote">
						<div class="box-head">Why Chrome?</div>
						<p>Chrome supports connecting a micro:bit to your web browser.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					Connect your micro:bit to your computer with a USB cable. </br>

					<img class="imageRight noshadow" style="height: 98px" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L1/usb-icon.png" alt="green circle around a USB cable" title="connected" />
					Select the USB icon in the upper left corner (shown right), then select your board from the dialog box.

				<li>
					A green circle should automatically appear behind the USB icon, showing that the micro:bit is connected. If not, ask your teacher for help.<br/>

		<div class="vocabBig"><p>A <strong>software library</strong> is a collection of procedures (blocks) that can be used in programs.</p></div>
		<h3>Adding Blocks</h3>
		<p>Your micro:bit is now connected, but you'll need to add more blocks to program it. You'll do this by adding a couple of <em>libraries</em> to MicroBlocks.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="6">
				<li>
					Click the + symbol next to Libraries.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L1/add-library.png" alt="plus sign next to Libraries circled" title="add library" width="350">
				</li>
				<li>
					Select "Basic Sensors.ubl" and then click "Open." <br/>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L1/select-libraries.png" alt="plus sign next to Libraries circled" title="add library" width="350">
				</li>
				<li>Do the same to load the "LED Display.ubl" library.</li>
			</ol>

		<h3>Using the <code>Display</code> Block</h3>
		<p>
			One block that's unique to micro:bit is the <code>display</code> block. It's designed to look like the grid of LEDs on the front side of the board. There are 25 LEDs that you can turn on and off individually.
		</p>
		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L1/display.png" alt="display block" title="display block" width="150">
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="9">
				<li>Drag the <code>display</code> block into the Scripts area (the large open area on the right), and design your own pattern by clicking the LED rectangles to turn them on or off.</li>
				<li>
					Click on the block once and a your pattern should appear on your micro:bit! (If not, work with your classmates or teacher to fix the problem.)<br/>

		<h3>Saving Your Project</h3>
		<div class="todo">We should include instructions for saving UBP files. Here's a suggestion... --MF, 1/28/22</div>
		<p>Saving in MicroBlocks is different from saving in Snap<em>!</em>.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="11">
				<li>
					<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-mini.png" alt="Save Your Work" title="Save Your Work" />
					 Download your project:
					<ol>
    					<li>Click the MicroBlocks "File" menu (<img class="inline nopadtb noshadow" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/general/microblocks-file-menu.jpg" alt="MicroBlocks File menu icon" title="MicroBlocks File menu icon" />).</li>
						<li>Choose "Save."</li>
						<li>Selecting a location on your computer.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>A file will download to your computer that you can open using MicroBlocks later.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>



		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned how to set up a coding environment for micro:bit and made a pattern on the micro:bit LED display.</div>
