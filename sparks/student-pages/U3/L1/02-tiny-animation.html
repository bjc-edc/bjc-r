        <h2>Tiny Animation</h2>
		<div class="todo">This page could also be split into two pages. That would make for 6 activities in this lab total, and I think that better matches our other labs. Deanna, if you agree with these changes, I'll go back and make the cuts and flesh out the TG a bit more after I finish reviewing the rest of 3.2 and make some progress with 2.2. :) --MF, 3/16/22</div>

        <div class="learn">In this activity, you'll write a script make an animation appear on the LED screen by switching between two screens. </div>

		<p>
			To start, you'll make an animation flipping between a smile and a frown.
		</p>
		<div class="todo">Deanna, do you have a plan for saving projects and creating accounts with MicroBlocks (e.g. Creating a Snap<em>!</em> Account on <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L1/03-creating-snap-account.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" target="_blank">1.1.3</a> or Loading and Saving on <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L1/04-say-hello-to-snap.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" target="_blank">1.1.4</a>)? That should added early in U3 (e.g., on 3.1.1). Then we can use the similar naming/saving/opening language as in other units. I also think we should include a link to MicroBlocks at the start of the page. --MF, 1/28/22</div>

					<strong>Tip:</strong> Animations are a rapid sequence of images displayed in a row. To bring your face to life, you'll need to switch between <code>display</code> blocks quickly, but not too quickly. To achieve this, use a <code>wait</code> block after each <code>display</code>. Adjust with the amount of time the program waits to what you like.
				</div>
				<li>
					Once your animation is playing on the micro:bit, create your own animation by switching between two <code>display</code> blocks.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3>Make an Interactive Animation</h3>
		<p>So far, your animation changes on its own, but you can control when it changes for example, by using the micro:bit's LEDs as light sensors. The LEDs can detect different levels of light, and you can program the micro:bit to change the animation depending on how much light they detect.</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>
					Use an <code>if</code> block together with a <code>light level</code> block to change the image on the LED screen based on the light detected.<br/>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L1/smiley-2.gif" alt="animation of two expressions on micro:bit" title="smiley loop" height="350">

				</li>
				<div class="endnote">
					<strong>Tip:</strong> Light levels vary greatly depending on the room that you're in, so you'll need to experiment with values for your program considers bright or dark, and you may need to change it later for a different room. One way to do this is to use the <code>say</code> block. <a href="#hint-drop" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a picture of how to know where a block you are dragging will drop">Click for a picture.</a>

				<li>Make a more complicated animation by adding more <code>display</code> blocks or varying the <code>wait</code> time.</li>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you used <code>display</code> blocks together with <code>forever</code>, <code>wait</code>, and <code>light level</code> to create animations controlled by pauses and by light.</div>
