		<h2>Interactive Pet</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll bring your pet to life using cardboard, paper, and code.</div>

        <p>You can do this activity in any order. Choose to work on the physical making of your pet or the code that controls its interactivity.</p>

		<h3>Add Interactivity</h3>
		<p>To make your pet interactive, you will need to use at least two different <strong>inputs</strong> that cause at least two different <strong>outputs</strong>.</p>

        <div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Input and Output</strong>
			<p>In computing, the <strong>input</strong> is the action that tells the computer to do something. The <strong>output</strong> is the resulting action that occurs after the input command is received.</p>
            <p>The micro:bit has different types of inputs: light (bright or dark), button pressed, or certain movement. The output we're currently exploring is displaying a picture on the LED display.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Consider the following inputs and decide which one to use to enhance your pet’s personality or story.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>light level</code> (like from Lab 1)</li>
            <li><code>button A</code> or <code>button B</code></li>
            <li><code>tilt x</code> or <code>tilt y</code> or <code>tilt z</code></li>
        </ul>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li><p>Use a <code>when</code> block to start your script.</p>
                <p><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L2/when-block.png" alt="when block in MicroBlocks" title="when block" width="200" /></p></li>
                <li><p>Select an input for your interactive pet. Note that you'll need to include an inequality with <code>light level</code> and <code>tilt x</code>. Experiment with different values to trigger the script (100 may not be the right value). For a reminder about inequalities, check out 1.6.2, 1.6.3, and 1.7.</p>

				<li><p>Create an animation using the <code>LED display</code>, <code>wait</code>, and <code>repeat</code> blocks.</p>

		<h3>Make a Pet</h3>
		<p>Remember that only part of this project is coding. Use craft materials like paper, markers, and cardboard to bring your pet to life. Think about how you'd like your micro:bit to fit into your project and how your LED display is incorporated.</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">	
            <ol start="4">
                <li><p>Make your pet body. Remember to consider how to integrate your micro:bit into your design.</p>
            </ol>   
		</div>

        <h3>Tell a Story</h3>
        <p>Now that you've made your interactive pet, document its interactions so that a classmate can know how to interact with it.</p>
        <div>
            <p>Describe your pet, how you interact with it (the inputs and outputs), and a story about your pet.</p>
            <p><i>Example: Meet Orange! He’s a very vocal cat. When the A button is pressed, he meows loudly. When the B button is pressed, he purrs softly.</i></p>

        </div>

        <div class="ifTime show">
            <ol start="5">
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />It's helpful to share your designs with others for design feedback, to share ideas, and to test that your project works as intended. Share your pet with a partner by telling its story of how to interact with it. If something doesn't work as intended, make your desired changes to your design.</li>
            </ol>
