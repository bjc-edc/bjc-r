		<h2>Telling a Story</h2>
		<div class="todo">Add documentation standard? --MF, 3/16/22</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll bring your pet to life using cardboard, paper, and code.</div>

        <p>Now that you've made your interactive pet, document its interactions so that a classmate can know how to interact with it.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Describe your pet, how you interact with it (the inputs and outputs), and a story about your pet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Write up your description to place next to your pet. When classmates or others visit your pet, they should know how to interact with it based on your text.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

                It's helpful to share your designs with others for design feedback, to share ideas, and to test that your project works as intended. Share your pet with a partner by telling its story of how to interact with it. If something doesn't work as intended, make your desired changes to your design.
