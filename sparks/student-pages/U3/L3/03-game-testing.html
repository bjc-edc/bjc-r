        <h2>Game Testing</h2>

        <div class="learn">In this activity, you'll get feedback from classmates on your game and iterate on your design.</div>

        <p>
            It's important to get feedback from others who are less familiar with your game. Use the instructions you wrote up in Activity 2 and share your game with another pair of classmates and ask them for feedback.
        </p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Answer the following questions after testing your classmates' game:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Was it easy to play?</li>
                        <li>Did the rules make sense?</li>
                        <li>Was there a clear winner?</li>
                        <li>What did you like about the game? What changes would you suggest your classmates make?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>After receiving feedback from your classmates, discuss with your partner what changes could improve your game play.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="ifTime show">
            If you have completed your game improvements early, make a game of the opposite type. For example, if you made a micro:bit only game, make a game that uses additional materials or visa versa.
        </div>

        <div class="learn">In this activity, you made improvements to your game based on classmate feedback.</div>
