		<h2>Servo Project</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll create your own servo project using the Bit Board, MicroBlocks, and general making materials.</div>

        <p>
            Before diving into your servo project, take some time to brainstorm independently and discuss your project idea with a classmate. 
        </p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Brainstorm how you want to incorporate motion into a project and what supplies you'll need to accomplish your idea.
                </li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Talk with a nearby classmate about your idea, and listen to theirs. Ask yourselves the following questions:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Describe the story of what will happen. What's the order of events?</li>
                    <li>Does a person need to interact with the story? If so, how?</li>
                    <li>Describe the movement? How will it start? How will it stop?</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        </div>

		<h3>Example 1: Goal!</h3>
        <p>Make a game using servos, like this soccer game. The servo controls the player's leg, which can then kick the ball into the goal. Keep track of the score on the micro:bit by pressing the A button the mark each point.</p>

        <div class="endnote">
            <strong>Tip:</strong> To keep track of the score, this project uses <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U3/L3/01-game-design.html">variables</a>, which were introduced in Lab 3 Activity 1: Game Design.  
        </div>

        <h3>Example 2: Pass the Ball</h3>
        <p>
            Move a ball from one end of a table to the other by passing it between servos. These servo arms are extended and modified with a cup on the end to hold a small ball. Start the sequence of events by pressing the B button on the micro:bit, which then initiates the servo arms to pass the ball from one cup to another.
        </p>
