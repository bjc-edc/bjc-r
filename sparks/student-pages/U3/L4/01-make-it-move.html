		<h3>Get Started</h3>
		<p>Motors are one way to add movement to your projects. There are many different types of motors, including one called a <i>servo motor.</i> </p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
			<p>A <strong>servo motor</strong> provides position control, so it can be told to move into an exact spot. Its position can be selected from 0 to 180 degrees.</p>
        </div>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Insert your micro:bit into the Bit Board, pins facing down.</li>
                <li>Connect a servo to the pins on the Bit Board, making note of which pins. Use the following image as reference for setup.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L4/servo-setup.png" alt="labeled diagram on how to set up microbit with Bit Board" title="Bit Board setup" width="500" />

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="3">
                <li>Add the servo library in MicroBlocks by selecting Library, and then Servo.ubl.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

        <p>Control the servo motor by using the servo motor blocks. After adding the servo library, you'll have the following blocks available:</p>

		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L4/servo.png" alt="servo blocks, including set servo position, set servo speed, and stop servo" title="MicroBlocks servo" width ="450" />

        <ul>
            <li><code>set servo to degrees</code></li>
            <p>Moves the servo arm to a particular position in degrees. The range of -90 to 90 degrees is equivalent to 180 degrees. Be sure to address the right servo (check your Bit Board to see which port your servo is connected to, and use the following chart as reference for determining servo position in degrees.</p>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L4/90-degrees.png" alt="cartesian coordinates with 0 degrees, 90 degrees, and -90 degrees labeled" title="-90 to 90 degrees" width ="450" />

            <li><code>set servo to speed</code></li>
            <p>Determine the speed at which the servo moves. The speed range is from 0 to 100, and the sign (positive or negative) determines the direction it turns.</p>

            <li><code>stop servo</code></li>
            <p>Stop the servo's movements.</p>

            <div class="endnote">
                <strong>Tip:</strong> Each block asks to specify which the servo number. Check which port your servo is plugged into on the Bit Board. The available options are 0, 1, 13, 14, or 15.
            </div>
        </ul>

        <h3>Add Movement</h3>
        Now that you've set up your micro:bit and servos, make your first movement. Use the <code>set servo to degrees</code> block to make the servo move, and change the sign (positive and negative) to switch the direction.

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>Make your servo move using at least two blocks.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			In this example, the servo motor moves twice with a <code>wait</code> block to add a pause between movements. This script starts by pressing the A button.
		</p>

		<h3>Add Another Type of Movement</h3>
		There are many ways to make a servo move: big or small, quick or slow, with pauses or rapid succession, the choice is yours!

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>
					Create a second servo movement.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			This example uses the B button to reset the servo's position.
		</p>

		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L4/servo-2.png" alt="reset the position of the servo arm after the first movement" title="Servo 2" width="450" />

		<div class="ifTime show">
			Now that you've made two different movements with your servo, consider making something more complex using different micro:bit <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U3/L2/02-building-your-pet.html">inputs</a>. Or add more than one servo to your Bit Board to control multiple motors simultaneously.
