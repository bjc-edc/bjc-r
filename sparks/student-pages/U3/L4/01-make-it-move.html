		<h3>Get Started</h3>
		<p>Motors are one way to add movement to your projects. There are many different types of motors, including one called a <i>servo motor.</i> </p>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Servo Motor</strong>
			<p>A <strong>servo motor</strong> (or just <strong>servo</strong>) provides position control, so it can be told to move into an exact spot. Its position can be selected from 0 to 180 degrees.</p>

                    Add the servo library in MicroBlocks by pressing "Add Library," selecting "Servo" (toward the bottom of the list), and pressing "Open." <br />

                    You should see a "Servo" block menu appear at the bottom of the palette on the left of the MicroBlocks screen (as shown here).

        <h3>Add Movement</h3>
        <p>
		    <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L4/90-degrees.png" alt="cartesian coordinates with 0 degrees, 90 degrees, and -90 degrees labeled" title="-90 to 90 degrees" width ="350" />
            You can control the servo motor by using the servo motor blocks. After adding the servo library, you'll have the following blocks available:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L4/servo.png" alt="servo blocks, including set servo position, set servo speed, and stop servo" title="MicroBlocks servo" width ="450" />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>set servo to degrees</code> moves the servo arm to a particular position in degrees. The range of -90 to 90 degrees is equivalent to 180 degrees. Be sure to address the right servo (check your Bit Board to see which port your servo is connected to, and use the chart as reference for determining servo position in degrees).
                </li>
                <li><code>set servo to speed</code> determines the speed at which the servo moves. The speed range is from 0 to 100, and the sign (positive or negative) determines the direction it turns.</li>
                <li><code>stop servo</code> stops the servo's movements.</li>
                <div class="endnote">
                    Each block asks to specify the servo number. You must use the number shown near the pins that your servo is connected to.
                </div>
            </ul>
        </p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>Make your servo move using at least two blocks.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			In this example, the servo motor moves twice with a <code>wait</code> block to add a pause between movements. This script starts by pressing the A button.
		</p>

		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L4/servo-1.png" alt="code blocks that include set servo to degrees blocks and wait blocks" title="Servo 1" width="450" />

		<h3>Add Another Type of Movement</h3>
		There are many ways to make a servo move: big or small, quick or slow, with pauses or rapid succession, the choice is yours!

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>
					Create a second servo movement.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			This example uses the B button to reset the servo's position.
		</p>

		<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L4/servo-2.png" alt="reset the position of the servo arm after the first movement" title="Servo 2" width="450" />

		<div class="ifTime show">
			Now that you've made two different movements with your servo, consider making something more complex using different micro:bit <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U3/L2/02-building-your-pet.html">inputs</a>. Or add more than one servo to your Bit Board to control multiple motors simultaneously.
