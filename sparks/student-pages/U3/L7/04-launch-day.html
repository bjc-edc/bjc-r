		<h2>Launch Day</h2>

        <div class="learn">In this activity, you and and your class will launch your chain reaction machine.</div>

        <h3>Final Preparations</h3>
        <p>This is your last opportunity to make small adjustments to your segment design before the finale. </p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Finalize the set-up for your segment. Use the following checklist as reference:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check every cause-and-effect. Are your objects positioned as needed? Does anything need to be secured?</li>
                        <li>Test your micro:bit components. Do they have batteries and react as intended?</li>
                        <li>Confirm your connections to neighboring pairs. Is everything in alignment?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Move away any extraneous materials to clear a path for the chain reaction.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>


        <div class="learn">In this activity, you tested your chain reaction segment with your partner and made improvements to your design.</div>
