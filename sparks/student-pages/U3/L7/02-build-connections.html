        <div class="learn">In this activity, you and a partner make you segment of the chain reaction using physical and digital materials.</div>

        <h3>Assemble Your Segment</h3>
        <p>Begin constructing your segment of the chain reaction and remember to include the following elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two micro:bits</li>
            <li>A variety of analog materials</li>
            <li>A story or theme</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>Decide with your partner which parts of the chain reaction segment you will work on. Each segment is made up of many parts, so you both will be able to work on parts separately as well as together.</li>
                <div class="endnote">
                    <ul>
                        <p>Create a rough plan of the sequence of events before diving deep into one aspect of the segment. If something isn't working as intended, take a step back and see if there's another way to accomplish the same movement or task.</p>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <li>As components of your segment become more finalized, secure them to the surface to avoid accidentally moving any of the pieces.</li>
                <li>Do small tests as you build. You might be surprised to find that something that worked well initially has stopped working after adding a few more pieces. Smaller tests will help with troubleshooting as you're building.</li>
                <div class="endnote">
                    <p>It's okay if your plan shifts as you're building. Communicate any changes with your partner and with neighboring groups, if necessary.</p>
                </div>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="ifTime show">Consider adding a finale to the end of the chain reaction. What will be the final celebratory act? Or final task accomplished?</div>

        <div class="learn">In this activity, you created your segment of the chain reaction with your partner.</div>
