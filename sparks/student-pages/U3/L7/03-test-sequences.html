		<h2>Test Sequences</h2>

        <div class="learn">In this activity, you and a partner test with your chain reaction segment and troubleshoot any missed connections.</div>

        <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
        <p>After making a complete segment for your class' chain reaction machine, it's important to test it as many times as time allows. It's often the case a chain reaction segment is inconsistent, or it tends to fail in the same spot. Take this time to really study your connections, both the physical materials as well as your micro:bit components, for opportunities to strengthen your design.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>Set off your chain reaction segment at least five times consecutively. It's alright if the cause-and-effect chain doesn't run as expected. Take note of the following each time you try:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does the chain reaction segment run from start to finish? If not, where does it end?</li>
                    <li>Were there any inconsistencies between trial runs? If so, where were they?</li>
                    <li>Did the micro:bit perform as intended? If not, are there ways to modify the MicroBlocks code to improve its performance?</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Take this information and make adjustments to your segment accordingly. Find any opportunity to make a part of your machine more consistent.</li>
                <li>After making these changes, return to question 1 and 2 for another round of testing. You may find that some of the previously problematic areas are now resolved, some may still be an issue, and new challenges may have arisen. Take note of these points in your segment and adjust them accordingly.</li>
                <div class="endnote">Take time to also check in with your neighboring teams. Run tests with both pairs (if applicable) and make similar changes.</div>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="ifTime show">
            <ol start="4">
				<li>Run larger tests with two or more groups and see if adding more segments changes how the chain reaction performs.</li>
			</ol>
        </div>

        <div class="learn">In this activity, you tested your chain reaction segment with your partner and made improvements to your design.</div>
