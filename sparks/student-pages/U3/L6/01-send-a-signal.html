		<p>A micro:bit can use <strong>radio waves</strong> to wirelessly communicate to another micro:bit. One micro:bit can send transmit or a message, the other will receive and can then be programmed to send a message back.</p>

		<div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Radio Communication</strong>
			<p><strong>Radio</strong> is a way of transmitting and receiving information over a distance.</p>
        </div>

		<p>Many micro:bits in the same room can cause interference and confusion when sending and receiving messages. To avoid this, pick a group that you and your partner will join that's unique from other groups. Start by sending a message back and forth with a partner, but know that you can add more than two micro:bits to a group for communication.</p>

		<h3>Text Messaging</h3>

		<p>Together with a partner, follow along with this example and then make your own.</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>Add the radio communication library by choosing <strong>Library</strong>, then <strong>Radio</strong> and <strong>Scroll Text</strong>.</li>

				<li>Both partners will create messages to send. It's important that these messages are different from one another to start, but this can be changed later on.</li>

				<li><strong>Both Partners</strong>: Add your group number to the <code>when started</code> block. The smiley face is a visual check for you to see that you are ready to receive radio messages. </li>
				<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L6/radio-when-started.png" alt="when started, set the radio group number" title="When Started with Radio" width="350"/>

				<li><strong>Each Partner</strong>: Pick a unique word or phrases to send to your partner. You can use the examples below as a test. In this case, Partner 1 has the message of <strong>Beep</strong> (left) on their micro:bit and Partner 2 has the message <strong>Boop</strong> (right).</li>
				<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L6/beep.png" alt="unique message 1: beep" title="Beep" width="300"/>
				<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L6/boop.png" alt="unique message 1]2: boop" title="Beep" width="300"/>

				<li><strong>Both Partners</strong>: Add this final script that checks for whether your micro:bit has received a message. To create it, start with the <code>when</code> block and <code>radio last received?</code> by dragging it on top of the green toggle.</li>
				<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L6/message-received.png" alt="when message received" title="Message Received" width="350"/>

				<li>Start the project by pressing the green play button in the top right hand corner. The new <code>when radio last received?</code> block should illuminate.</li>
				<img class="inline noshadow" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L6/highlight.png" alt="highlight message after starting project" title="Message Received Highlighted" width="350"/>

				<li>Test out your code by pressing the <strong>A button</strong> on each micro:bit and see your message scroll by.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3>Send an Integer</h3>
		<p>In addition to sending text, it's also useful to know how to send numbers using radio. This process is very similar to sending strings, though some of the blocks are slightly different.</p>
		<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U3/L6/radio-int.png" alt="radio blocks for using integers" title="Radio Blocks Integers" width="550"/>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<div>
				<ol start="8">
					<li>Review how the original messages were sent and created.</li>
					<li>Update the code to send and receive messages with numbers (integers).</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="ifTime show">
			<p>Begin brainstorming with your partner about a larger project you would like to build that uses radio communication. Consider bringing in tools and techniques that you've already learned to enhance your project (servo motors, LEDs, etc).</p>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned how to connect two micro:bits wirelessly using the radio feature and sent and received messages from a classmate.</div>
