					<strong>Reporters: </strong> There are several kinds of blocks in Snap<em>!</em>. The <code>say hello</code> block is a <strong>reporter</strong> block. Reporters do a computation and then "report" the result. For example, the result of running the reporter block below is the text "olá Ana" shown in the bubble beside it.<br />

				</li>

				<li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Many blocks, like <code>say hello</code>, accept <strong>inputs</strong> that customize what they do. Inputs appear as spaces you can edit. The <code>say hello</code> block accepts two inputs: a name and a language. As you've seen, changing the inputs to a reporter can change the output it reports.</li>
