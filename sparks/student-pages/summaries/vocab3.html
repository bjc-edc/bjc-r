<h2>Unit 3 Lab 2: Interactive Pet, Activity 1</h2>
<h3>Lab 2: Interactive Pet</h3>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>  <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U3/L2/01-designing-pet.html">3.2.1</a>: Input and Output</strong>

			<p>In computing, the <strong>input</strong> is the action that tells the computer to do something. The <strong>output</strong> is the resulting action that occurs after the input command is received.</p>

            <p>The micro:bit has different types of inputs: light (bright or dark), button pressed, or certain movement. The output we're currently exploring is displaying a picture on the LED display.</p>

<h3>Lab 3: Game Play</h3>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth">
  <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U3/L3/01-game-design.html">3.3.1</a>:
			<p>A <strong>variable</strong> is like a labeled box that can store a value, such as a word, a number, or a list.</p>

<h3>Lab 4: Marvelous Motions</h3>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
  <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U3/L4/01-make-it-move.html">3.4.1</a>:
			<p>A <strong>servo motor</strong> provides position control, so it can be told to move into an exact spot. Its position can be selected from 0 to 180 degrees.</p>

        </div>
 

<h3>Lab 5: Paper Stories</h3>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth">
  <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U3/L5/01-led-it-glow.html">3.5.1</a>:
			<p>An <strong>LED</strong> contains a light emitter inside of a plastic bulb. This light emitter can be made from different materials, and when electricity runs through it, it shines different colors. However, electricity can only flow in one direction, and the name for electronic parts with this quality is called a diode. Thus, an LED stands for "light-emitting diode."</p>

            <div class="vocabFullWidth">
  <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U3/L5/03-paper-story.html">3.5.3</a>:
                <p>A <strong>parallel circuit</strong> has multiple branches and allows for easier addition of multiple LEDs. In parallel, the LEDs retain most of their brightness.</p>

    

                <p>A <strong>series circuit</strong> has all elements in a chain, one after another and makes a complete circle. In series, the more LEDs added, the dimmer they become. </p>

<h3>Lab 6: Making with Multiples</h3>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>  <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U3/L6/01-send-a-signal.html">3.6.1</a>: Radio Communication</strong>

			<p><strong>Radio</strong> is a way of transmitting and receiving information over a distance.</p>
