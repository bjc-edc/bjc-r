<h2>Unit 1 Lab 1: Introduction to Snap!, Activity 1</h2>
<h3>Lab 1: Introduction to Snap!</h3>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><!--<strong>: Reporters</strong> and <strong>Inputs</strong>-->
  <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L1/01-say-hello-to-snap.html">1.1.1</a>:
			<ul>

    			<li>

					<strong>Reporters: </strong> There are several kinds of blocks in Snap<em>!</em>. The <code>say hello</code> block is a <strong>reporter</strong> block. Reporters do a computation and then "report" the result. For example, the result of running the reporter block below is the text "olá Ana" shown in the bubble beside it.<br />

					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-with-inputs-reporting.png" alt="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'olá Ana'" title="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'olá Ana'" /><br />

				</li>

				<li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Many blocks, like <code>say hello</code>, accept <strong>inputs</strong> that customize what they do. Inputs appear as spaces you can edit. The <code>say hello</code> block accepts two inputs: a name and a language. As you've seen, changing the inputs to a reporter can change the output it reports.</li>

<h3>Lab 2: Super Short Stories</h3>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>  <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L2/02-refining-the-story.html">1.2.2</a>: Abstraction</strong>

			<div class="commentBig"><p>Will they be watching a video on abstraction here? Or does Dan mention it in welcome? It feels so..abstract..here that I wonder what students will take from it. If I wasn't bound to use the term abstraction, I'd probably emphasize the benefit of reuse "When we realize we've developed a useful piece of functionality that we might want to use in other places, we can turn it into its own block." Anyway just musings from your local "abstraction" skeptic, feel free to delete. -- PF 8/20/21</p><p>I added your text at the beginning and am open to a Dan video and/or more discussion about teaching abstraction. :) --MF, 8/20/21</p></div>

			<p>When you realize you've developed a useful piece of script behavior that you might want to use in other places, you can turn it into its own block. This is a form of <em>abstraction</em>.</p>

			<p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is an important idea in computer science. One kind of abstraction is breaking up a large problem into smaller sub-problems.</p>

			<p>For example, instead of putting <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/join-random-animal-s.png" alt="join (random animal) (s)" title="join (random animal) (s)" /> into an input slot of <code>super short story</code>, you can create a <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/plural-of.png" alt="plural of ()" title="plural of ()" /> block and put <code>random animal</code> in its input slot.</p>

			<p>This makes your code easier to read, you can use this new block again in other places, and once the block is working, you don't need to think about <em>how</em> it works each time you use it.  (For example, you might later improve <code>plural</code> to handle words such as "fly" and "box" that don't form their plural just by adding an "s.")</p>

		</div>
 

		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>  <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L2/03-creating-editing-blocks.html">1.2.3</a>: Local Variables</strong>

		  <p>Block inputs (such as <var>feeling</var>,  <var>job</var>, <var>action 1</var>, <var>place</var>, <var>action 2</var>, etc., in the <code>super short story</code> example) are called <strong>local variables</strong> because the value they report to <code>join words</code> <em>varies</em> based on what is typed into the input slots of <code>super short story</code>, but they only can be used in this <em>local</em> context (you can't drag them out of the block editor and expect them to work in other parts of your code).</p>

		  <div class="todo">Should this mention that block/script local is different from sprite local? -bh 2/6/22</div>

					<p>A <strong>list</strong> is an ordered sequence of items.<div class="todo">PLEASE don't interrupt experiments with huge vocabulary lessons. The language "reports a list" is sufficient context to make clear what a list is. And anyway, kids already know. They've seen the lists you show here and before that they've seen shopping lists. The fact that a list, in this context  is "an ordered sequence" (unlike a shopping list) is true and important but can be taken for granted. Kids want to experiment and the last two items in this activity are potentially fun and interesting. Making vocabulary a priority just guarantees that it will become the focus of the course, will be tested, and will kill any semblance of B and J that is left. --PG </div></p>

			<p>A <strong>decimal numeral</strong> is part of the base 10 system, the system we learn by counting on ten fingers.</p>

			<p>In base 10, there are ten digits (0-9), and each place is worth ten times as much as the place to its right.</p>

					We can figure out the decimal equivalent by adding up the 2 two-hundred-fifty-sixes, the D (that is, 13) sixteens, and the 9 ones: (2 &times; 256) + (13 &times; 16) + (9 &times; 1) = 729.

<h3>Lab 6: Texting Tricks</h3>

			<p>

                A <strong>predicate</strong> is a hexagon-shaped reporter that asks a true/false question such as these examples:<br />

                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/8-gt-7-reporting-true.png" alt="8 > 7 reporting true" title="8 > 7 reporting true" />

            </p>

			<p>

				A <strong>conditional</strong> is a block that controls the code based on a true/false condition (the predicate). The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" /> block is an example of a conditional.
