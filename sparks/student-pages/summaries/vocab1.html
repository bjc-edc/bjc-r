<h2>Unit 1 Lab 1: Introduction to Snap!, Activity 1</h2>
<h3>Lab 1: Introduction to Snap!</h3>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth">

			<ul>

    			<li>

					<strong>Reporters: </strong> There are several kinds of blocks in Snap<em>!</em>. The <code>say hello</code> block is a <strong>reporter</strong> block. Reporters do a computation and then "report" the result. For example, the result of running the reporter block below is the text "olá Ana" shown in the bubble beside it.<br />

					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-with-inputs-reporting.png" alt="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'olá Ana'" title="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'olá Ana'" /><br />

				</li>

				<li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Many blocks, like <code>say hello</code>, accept <strong>inputs</strong> that customize what they do. Inputs appear as spaces you can edit. The <code>say hello</code> block accepts two inputs: a name and a language. As you've seen, changing the inputs to a reporter can change the output it reports.</li>

<h3>Lab 2: Super Short Stories</h3>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>  <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/C:/Users/I560638/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L2/02-refining-the-story.html">1.2.2</a>: Abstraction</strong>

			<div class="commentBig"><p>Will they be watching a video on abstraction here? Or does Dan mention it in welcome? It feels so..abstract..here that I wonder what students will take from it. If I wasn't bound to use the term abstraction, I'd probably emphasize the benefit of reuse "When we realize we've developed a useful piece of functionality that we might want to use in other places, we can turn it into its own block." Anyway just musings from your local "abstraction" skeptic, feel free to delete. -- PF 8/20/21</p><p>I added your text at the beginning and am open to a Dan video and/or more discussion about teaching abstraction. :) --MF, 8/20/21</p></div>

			<p>When you realize you've developed a useful piece of script behavior that you might want to use in other places, you can turn it into its own block. This is a form of <em>abstraction</em>.</p>

			<p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is an important idea in computer science. One kind of abstraction is breaking up a large problem into smaller sub-problems.</p>

			<p>For example, instead of putting <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/join-random-animal-s.png" alt="join (random animal) (s)" title="join (random animal) (s)" /> into an input slot of <code>super short story</code>, you can create a <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/plural-of.png" alt="plural of ()" title="plural of ()" /> block and put <code>random animal</code> in its input slot.</p>

			<p>This makes your code easier to read, you can use this new block again in other places, and once the block is working, you don't need to think about <em>how</em> it works each time you use it.  (For example, you might later improve <code>plural</code> to handle words such as "fly" and "box" that don't form their plural just by adding an "s.")</p>

			You are creating a reporter, so the block editor opens with a <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/report.png" alt="report" title="report" /> block already attached to the <code>plural </code> hat block.

		<div class="forYouToDo">

		  <div class="todo">Why do you prefer the Plain Prototype Labels mode?  We put a lot of thought into the visible plus signs in the default mode, mainly because it makes the process of adding inputs <i>discoverable,</i> whereas it's pretty hard to hover in just the right place to make an invisible plus sign become visible and then click it.  I made Jens add the invisible-plus option only for the sake of making script pics for the manual and other documentation, not as a good way for users to use Snap<i>!.</i> -bh</div>

					<p>We have a JS script so they can be paused. I'm not against movies in theory, and I can't recall exactly why we've opted against them, but it might have been usability. Videos have to be hosted somewhere, and if the school restricts domains, then the video might not be visible. Uploading elsewhere also recreates development overhead. That's acceptable when a video is really needed (like 1.1.1) but for something quick like this, a little animated GIF is easier to create and embed as an image. Just a few thoughts. We can discuss further if you like. --MF, 8/20/21</p>

<h3>Lab 4: Image Manipulation</h3>
				<div class="vocabFullWidth">

					<p>A <strong>list</strong> is an ordered sequence of items.<div class="todo">PLEASE don't interrupt experiments with huge vocabulary lessons. The language "reports a list" is sufficient context to make clear what a list is. And anyway, kids already know. They've seen the lists you show here and before that they've seen shopping lists. The fact that a list, in this context  is "an ordered sequence" (unlike a shopping list) is true and important but can be taken for granted. Kids want to experiment and the last two items in this activity are potentially fun and interesting. Making vocabulary a priority just guarantees that it will become the focus of the course, will be tested, and will kill any semblance of B and J that is left. --PG </div></p>

					<p>You might be familiar with <em>subtractive</em> color mixing where the primary colors are red, yellow, and blue and you can get secondary colors by mixing red and yellow to make orange, yellow and blue to make green, and red and blue to make purple. Mixing paints is subtractive color mixing, but mixing light (like the images on a screen) is <em>additive</em> color mixing. In additive color mixing, the primaries are red, green, and blue, and the secondary colors that you get by mixing equal parts of the primaries are yellow, cyan, and magenta.</p>

					<p>Additive color mixing (like on a screen) is called <em>additive</em> because you start with no light and <em>add</em> light to get colors. Subtractive color mixing (like with paint) is called <em>subtractive</em> because you start with white light (which includes all the colors), and the paint <em>absorbs</em> (takes away) all the colors except the one reflected back to your eye.  (For example, when white light hits red paint, all colors are absorbed except red.)</p>

		</p>

			<p>A <strong>decimal numeral</strong> is part of the base 10 system, the system we learn by counting on ten fingers.</p>

			<p>In base 10, there are ten digits (0-9), and each place is worth ten times as much as the place to its right.</p>

			<div class="endnote">

						<div>100s place</div>

						<div>10s place</div>

						<div>1s place</div>

					</div><br />

					The number 239 is equal to (2 × 100) + (3 × 10) + (9 × 1). You could write it in Snap<em>!</em> like this:<br />

					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab05/239-decimal-reporting.png" alt="((2 × 100) + (3 × 10)) + (9 × 1) reporting 239" title="((2 × 100) + (3 × 10)) + (9 × 1) reporting 239" />

			</ol>

		</div>



		<p>Instead of counting on ten fingers, computers count with only <em>two</em> options: on and off. So, computers store numbers as <em>binary</em> numerals. All their calculations are in binary. They convert the decimal numerals we use to interact with computers into binary numerals before performing any calculations.</p>



			<p>A <strong>binary numeral</strong> is part of the base 2 system.</p>

			<p>In base 2, there are two digits (0-1), and each place is worth twice times as much as the place to its right.</p>

			<div class="endnote">

				<p><a href="#hint-binary-1010" data-toggle="collapse" title="For example, consider the binary numeral 1010...">For example, consider the binary numeral 1010...</a></p>

					We can figure out the decimal equivalent by adding up all the places that have a one (that is, 8 + 2 = 10). You could write it in Snap<em>!</em> like this:<br />

							<strong>Base 2</strong> uses the same idea but with <strong>powers of two</strong> instead of powers of ten. Binary place values represent the units place (2<sup>0</sup> = 1), the twos place (2<sup>1</sup> = 2), the fours place (2<sup>2</sup> = 4), the eights place (2<sup>3</sup> = 8), the sixteens place (2<sup>4</sup> = 16), etc. So, for example:

		<h3>Hexadecimal vs. Binary</h3>

		<p>Computers store information in binary as on and off signals (ones and zeros), but for computer programmers,

typing long strings of ones and zeros is inconvenient and prone to typos. Hexadecimal (also known as "hex") numbers require less typing and are easier to type correctly.</p>

		<p>Since 16 is a power of 2 (2<sup>4</sup> = 16), 4 bits fit inside one hex digit. For example, the binary numeral 1101 is (1 &times; 8) + (1 &times; 4) + (0 &times; 2) + (0 &times; 1) = 13 in decimal or just D in hex.</p>

		<h3>Hexadecimal and RGB Colors</h3>

		<p>The three color values of RGB pixels each range from 0 to 255 because eight bits are used for each of the three colors and 2<sup>8</sup> = 256. But in hexadecimal, 16<sup>2</sup> = 256, so it only takes two hex digits to represent each of the RGB color values (0 to 255 in decimal is 00 to FF in hex). </p>

        <p>As you've seen, if all three color values are as bright as possible, we see white, and if they are as dark as possible, we see black. Instead of writing (255, 255, 255) for white and (0, 0, 0) for black, we often use hex notation: FFFFFF and 000000.</p>

			

		<p>Also <span style="color:#8000FF;">(128, 0, 255) = 8000FF</span> is the color is purple: some red (128 = 80<sub>16</sub>) and as much blue as possible (255 = FF<sub>16</sub>), but no green at all (0 = 00<sub>16</sub>). And <span style="color:#FF7F00;"> this color is red 255, green 127, and blue 0</span>, which is <span style="color:#FF7F00;">FF7F00</span> in hex.</p>

			<p>

                A <strong>predicate</strong> is a hexagon-shaped reporter that asks a true/false question such as these examples:<br />

                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/8-gt-7-reporting-true.png" alt="8 > 7 reporting true" title="8 > 7 reporting true" />

            </p>

			<p>

				A <strong>conditional</strong> is a block that controls the code based on a true/false condition (the predicate). The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" /> block is an example of a conditional.
