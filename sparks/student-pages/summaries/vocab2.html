				<li>The <strong>stage</strong> is the rectangle in the upper right of the Snap<em>!</em> window. It's what users of your project see, and it's where your sprites live.</li>

				<li>A <strong>costume</strong> is a picture that can be "worn" by a sprite.</li>

				<li>A <strong>background</strong> is a picture that can be "worn" by the stage.</li>
