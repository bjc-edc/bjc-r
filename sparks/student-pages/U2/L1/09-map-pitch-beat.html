		<h2><code>Map</code>ping over Pitches and Beats</h2>
		<div class="todo">Consider making most of this page TIF/Tough Stuff. --MF, 7/25/23</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will learn how to transpose data in a song that is stored in a table.</div>

		<p>
			You've learned how to use <code>map</code> to transpose (shift) all the pitch values in a song where each note plays for the same length, and you've learned how to use a table to store both pitch and beat values for the notes in a song. You can also transpose the pitch values stored in a table.<br />

			This code is a bit complicated. Notice that it plays a version of <var>Mario Theme</var> that has gone through the <code>map</code> block. So the question is: What does this <code>map</code> block do?
		</p>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>Obviously, this whole page a bit of a reach, but I feel like the question will arise for some kids of how to do this, and so I want to offer something for them (even if they just read it on their own time). In the TG, this will be listed as optional. Any suggestions for improving this presentation? --MF, 2/27/22</p>
			<p>Yeah, this is a bit of a doozy, especially because they really should have read the yellow box on the previous page to understand the ADT selectors. I definitely think it should be optional, as you say it is. Maybe you can make sure they've read that yellow box, or repeat all/parts of it here? -pf 3/6/22</p>
			<p>I've added a first problem on this page about going back and reading that. Sufficient to close this comment, or should we discuss this further? --MF, 3/7/22</p>

			Recall that <code>play song with pitches and beats</code> expects a table of song data as input, <code>map</code> works through every item in a list, and every item in the table of pitches and beats is one note. So, <code>map</code> applies a function to every note in the <var>Mario Theme</var> and  outputs a table of notes (pairs of pitches and beats).<br />

			In order for <code>map</code> to output a table of pitches and beats, it needs to apply a function that outputs pairs of pitches and beats. So the code needs a structure like this:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/play-song-beats-mario-map01.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			What function outputs pitches and beats? The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/note-pitch-beats.png" alt="♪ pitch () beats ()" title="♪ pitch () beats ()" /> block. So the code needs a structure like this:<br />
			<div class="comment">Needs alt-title text. --MF, 2/27/22</div>
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/play-song-beats-mario-map02.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>But remember that the inputs that end up in the blank spots of the function in the <code>map</code> block each time it applies the function are the items in the input list, which in this case are the notes (pitches and beats from <var>Mario Theme (with beats)</var>).</p>
		<p>
			So, to get a beats value in the beats slot, we need to use the <code>beats from ♪</code> block, which takes a note (with a pitch and a beat) and reports just the beat.<br />

			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/play-song-beats-mario-map03.png" alt="" title="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			And to get a pitch value in the pitch slot, we need to use the <code>pitches from ♪</code> block, and we need to add our shift value to do the transpose.<br />

				<p>OK, cut for now, but left for possible discussion. I don't disagree with any of this; I was trying to get at "Why is this so complicated? Can we do this an easier way?" and empower students: "If you have an idea, try it!" But I guess it's not as empowering to say "try it" i this case... --MF, 3/6/22</p>
				<div class="todo">I don't understand why this problem is here in particular.  It's something that could be asked all of the zillion places in which this curriculum shows how to do something.  Do you have in mind a particular thing you think they'll try that won't work? --bh 3/3/22</div>
				<li>
					Do you have an idea for a different way to transpose a song that has both pitch and beat information? Try to build it. If it works, explain how it works to someone else. If it doesn't work, talk with someone else and figure out why it doesn't work.
					<div class="endnote">
						<div class="todo"> I'm noticing a bunch of these exhortations in yellow boxes in the curriculum.  I'm not a fan.  This particular one is especially bad because it tells students, "you think you know another way, but it's not going to work, ha ha, you're dumb."  I would go through the whole curriculum, find all of these, and remove them. --bh 3/3/22</div>
