			In the <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L2/03-creating-editing-blocks.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 2: Super Short Stories, Activity 3: Creating and Editing Blocks" target="_blank">Super Short Stories</a> lab, you began using <em>local variables</em> to access the inputs to a block you were editing. Those variables were only available within that block.<br />

			When you need a variable to be available <em>anywhere</em> in your project, you can use a <em>global variable</em>.

        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Global Variable</strong>
            <p>A <strong>global variable</strong> is a variable that is usable by all scripts in the program.</p>
        </div>
		<p>
			For example, you can use a global variable to store the pitches of a song.<br />

						<ol type="a">
							<li>Click <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/make-a-variable.png" alt="make a variable button" title="make a variable button" />  in the Variables palette. (It's not a block; you can't drag it into the scripting area.)</li>
							<li>Type the name for your variable. (Use the name of the song or something else to help you remember it. Don't forget that the name can have spaces in it—it doesn't have to be just one word.)</li>
							<li>Click "OK."</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					Set your global variable to store your song. Here's how...

						<h4><strong>Setting a Global Variable</strong></h4>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Drag the <code>set variable</code> block out of the Variables palette and into the scripting area.</li>
							<li>In the first input slot, select the name of your global variable by clicking the triangle (▼) to open the menu.</li>
							<li>Drag the <code>list</code> block with your song pitches into the second input slot.</li>
							<li>Click the <code>set variable</code> block to run it.</li>
							<li>
								Notice that a watcher containing the pitches to your song appears on the Snap<em>!</em> stage.<br />

				<li>
					Create another global variable and make it store a different song.<br />

				</li>
				<li>
					Try out your second variable in your <code>play song</code> block, and check that it works too.<br />

				Your global variables will appear in <em>watchers</em> on the Snap<em>!</em> stage. You can use the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/show-variable-full-size.png" alt="show variable" title="show variable" /> and <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/hide-variable-full-size.png" alt="hide variable" title="hide variable" /> blocks to control whether your variables show on the stage. Try showing and hiding your song variables.<br />

					<div class="endnote">Recall that you can also show or hide a watcher by using its checkbox in the palette on the left of the Snap<em>!</em> window.</div>

					You can use variables to store pieces of a song and then snap several <code>play song</code> blocks together to play the same parts of a song more than once. Try building a more complicated song that way.
