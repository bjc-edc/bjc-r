		<h2>Mystery Song Game</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will use your <code>mystery song</code> block to create a game.</div>
		
		<p>
			There are command block versions of two blocks you've already seen:
			<ul>
				<li>
					You've used the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" /> reporter. Snap<em>!</em> also 	has a built-in command version: 
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/if-else-full-size.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then 'C-shaped input slot' else 'C-shaped input slot'" title="if 'predicate input slot' then 'C-shaped input slot' else 'C-shaped input slot'" />
					<div class="endnote">
						<a href="#hint-if" data-toggle="collapse" title="Learn more about the difference between the reporter IF THEN ELSE and the command IF ELSE.">Learn more about the difference between the reporter <code>if then else</code> and the command <code>if else</code>.</a>
					<div id="hint-if" class="collapse">
					  <div class="todo">"what the computer should report."  What does that mean?  It's not "the computer" that's reporting; it's a particular block, namely the IF THEN ELSE block.  If what this means is that IF THEN ELSE appears in a custom reporter and decides what the reporter should report, that's the case only if the IF THEN ELSE is directly the input to a REPORT, rather than part of a larger computation.  I think I'd say "... to choose one of two possible values to report."  That makes it IF THEN ELSE itself that's reporting.  "... what the computer should do" is more defensible, but pretty vague.  I'd rather see "to decide which of two scripts to run." --bh 3/3/22<br>
I like "to choose one of two possible values to report" or "what the block should report." I don't like 'scripts' as I get confused about what scripts mean. - pf 3/3/22

You can use the command version to decide what the computer should <em>do</em>. Like the reporter version, the command <code>if else</code> block takes three inputs:
								<ol>
									<li>A testing condition (such as <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/answer-equals-stronger.png" alt="(answer) = ('Stronger')" title="(answer) = ('Stronger')" />)</li>
									<li>What to do if it's true</li>
									<li>What to do if it's false</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
								<p>The command block, however, performs a set of commands depending on the result of the condition rather than reporting an output.</p>
								<div class="todo">I think a specific example, with a picture of an IF ELSE <em>instruction</em> (inputs filled in), would help. -bh 3/3/22 +1 -pf 3/3/22</div>

					<div class="todo">When they used the ASK reporter, were they told that it <em>isn't</em> a Snap<i>!</i> primitive?  If not, the implicit revelation below should be made explicit, or they'll be confused, and even more so if they click the hint box. Also, what's the virtue of teaching ASK AND WAIT?  Even in an imperative project, I'd rather use a reporter that connects the question with the answer so you can't have bugs from being confused about what's the most recently asked question.  ASK AND WAIT is a kludge, inherited from Scratch in the days when they really didn't much like reporters.  I wish ASK were the primitive! --bh 3/3/22<p>I don't disagree with anything you are saying in principle, but in this unit, we are trying to begin preparing them for Snap<em>!</em> as it exists in the wild, and that doesn't have <code>ask</code>. We could go back and make sure they were told that <em>everything</em> they've learned that isn't a primitive isn't a primitive, but instead, we've opted for the to-be-created end-of-unit blocks list that will make the distinction. --MF, 3/6/22</div>

					<div class="todo">I think this is a little tricky. How's the following for scaffolding? At the last focus group, we got the message that some kids do better with more scaffolding than we are giving <em>and</em> that teachers' CS goals for middle school prioritize engagement over formal CS content which will occur in HS if we hook them now. They were convincing, and I added a final hint here.  --MF, 2/11/22</div>

			<p>Cut for now. I believe some of this was here at Dan's request, so I'm not cutting without more attention. --MF, 3/6/22</p>

		  <div class="todo">
			  <p>I'm not sure what you expect them to do here.  If the idea is that they nest another IF ELSE in the else clause of the first one, that's a whole new idea, and one students find hard, not appropriate for an ITIT. I'm not sure this is salvageable, but it might be with a serious rewriting. --bh 3/3/22</p>
			  <p>I assumed it was just using an or. Maybe should explicitly suggest using the or block. You can also say "to allow the user to be correct with different variations on the song title", which is different from having to implement a spell checker (a quite difficult task, as 61A students will attest this semester!). -pf 3/3/22</p>
			  <p>I made this a TIF for now. (And then I cut it.) ;) --MF, 3/6/22</p>
			</div>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>Use a second <code>if else</code> block and predicate (hexagonal testing function) to allow the user to be correct even with a different variation of the spelling of the song. For example, you might want the game to approve either "The Alphabet Song" or "Alphabet."</li>
				<li>If you created two mystery songs, you could make a new command block that randomly chooses which one to play by using <code>random</code> together with <code>if else</code>. </li>
				<div class="todo"><p>I like this idea, but I don't see a way to do more than two mystery songs with the blocks they know at this point (e.g., not global or script variables---globals are taught later in this lab). Am I missing anything? --MF, 2/10/22</p>
				<p>I don't understand the question.  How can they do even two songs?  Presumably by putting the two song scripts in the slots of the IF ELSE.  Well, if they can do that, they can nest two IF ELSE blocks, as in the ITIT above, and that gives them three slots for songs, etc. --bh 3/3/22</p>
                                <p>I also don't know how to do this without using some variable to track which song they ended up picking and asking about, since we need that to happen before the if/else that checks the answer. Ah okay well I guess you can have the if condition be a random number between 1 and length of songs, and then inside the if/else clause, it plays the song and asks them for their guess, but then I bet they'll end up repeating all that ask-code and it'll be gross. I feel like doing this cleanly is hard. --pf 3/3/22</p>
