		<h2>Songs with Pitches <em>and</em> Beats</h2>

		<div class="todo">
			<p>Consider that students don't always have to download a new XML; they could just import blocks into existing projects. --MF </p>
			<p>Consider making this page optional. --MF, 7/25/23</p>
		</div>


		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will learn to store and play songs with both pitch and length of each note.</div>
		<p>
			So far, you've been using a <code>play song</code> block that only lets you control the pitch of each note (by giving it a list of pitches as input). The number of beats was the same based on whatever you typed into the <code>play ♪</code> block inside your <code>play song</code> block (for example, 0.5 in the image below).<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/play-song-definition.png" alt="play song (pitches) {
	for each (pitche) in (pitches) {
		play ♪ pitch: (pitch) beats: (0.5)
	}
}" title="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/play-song-definition.png" alt="play song (pitches) {
	for each (pitche) in (pitches) {
		play ♪ pitch: (pitch) beats: (0.5)
	}
}" />
		</p>
		<p>
			You can use a table to store the data for every note and then use <code>play song with pitches and beats</code>, which expects music data <em>in a table</em>, to play the song. Each item in the list below is a new block: <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/note-pitch-beats.png" alt="♪ pitch: () beats: ()" title="♪ pitch: () beats: ()" />. It looks like the <code>play ♪</code> command, but it's a reporter that reports the pitch and beat.<br />

		<div class="todo">
			<p>The introduction of an ADT that's used throughout this activity can't be inside a hint inside a yellow "optional" box!  Also, they've seen abstract data types before, no?  If so, there should be a reference back to their introduction.  If this <em>is</em> their introduction, it needs much more explicit calling out as a Big Idea. --bh 3/3/22</p>
			<p>We've agreed not to <em>teach</em> ADTs at all in this course. We are only <em>using</em> them here (with the option to learn more). You can reopen this decision if you like, of course, but that has been the agreement so far. --MF, 3/6/22</p>

				<p>
					Each note (<var>♪</var>) in the song now has both pitch and beat information, and <code>play ♪</code> needs to receive those data in separate input slots. The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/pitch.png" alt="pitch from ♪" title="pitch from ♪" /> and <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/beats.png" alt="beats from ♪" title="beats from ♪" /> blocks each take a note (<var>♪</var>) as input and report only one piece of information to the <code>play ♪</code> block.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/pitch-definition.png" alt="pitch (♪) {
		report (item (1) of (♪))
	}" title="pitch (♪) {
		report (item (1) of (♪))
	}" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/beats-definition.png" alt="beats (♪) {
		report (item (2) of (♪))
	}" title="beats (♪) {
		report (item (2) of (♪))
	}" />
				</p>
				<p>
					So, <code>play song with pitches and beats</code> takes a table of song data with pitches and beats as input (<code>song</code>), and it plays each note (<var>♪</var>) at the specified pitch for the specified number of beats.<br />
