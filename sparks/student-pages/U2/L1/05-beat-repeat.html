		<h3>Using <code>For Each</code> to Traverse a List</h3>
		<div class="todo"><p>The paragraph below is well-intentioned, but it doesn't belong here.  Maybe after your sample song that uses REPEAT?</p><p>Where do you mean, exactly? --MF, 3/6/22</p>
		  <div class="todo">
		    <p>Using the <code>repeat</code> block strategically can make your code shorter and easier to read. It's generally a good idea to write shorter code that is easier to read because when something isn't working right, it's easier to find and fix the problem, or when you want to change it later or have someone else read it, that's easier too.</p>

			One way to simplify writing a song is to use a <em>list</em> to store the pitches and then play each pitch in the list. You can use <code>for each</code> to run a command (or group of commands) for each item in a list. For example: <br />
			<a class="js-run snap-project" href="/bjc-r/sparks/prog/U2/lab01/sample-song-with-for-each.xml" title="Example of For Each - Snap! project" target="_blank"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/example-for-each.png" alt="for each (pitch) in (list (60) (60) (67) (67) (69) (69) (67) (0) (65) (65) (64) (64) (62) (62) (60) (0)) {
	play ♪ pitch: (pitch) beats: (0.5)
}" title="for each (pitch) in (list (60) (60) (67) (67) (69) (69) (67) (0) (65) (65) (64) (64) (62) (62) (60) (0)) {
	play ♪ pitch: (pitch) beats: (0.5)
}" /></a>

		<div class="endnote">Playing the pitch 0 works like a rest (a pause in the music).</div>

			<p>A <strong>list</strong> is an ordered sequence of items. You've been using lists throughout this course: to store words for a story, to manipulate the letters of a secret message, and even to store lists such as each individual's responses to the question in a survey.</p>

						<p>This might be a risky move. I was hoping to give the kids a chance to start from scratch if they had a cluttered project, but it does mean that from this page on, some students will have only one project for the lab while others will have two. It also means that I can't refer to their project by name on the subsequent pages, so if they name it awkwardly and forget the name, they won't be able to find it. Thoughts? --MF, 2/23/22</p>
						<p>The further along I get in writing this lab, the more I regret this choice because I have no way of telling them what project I want them to open other than "your last one". I'm now thinking they should start from a new starter XML here without any option. Thoughts? --MF, 2/27/22</p>
						<p>I agree, pick one. I first thought they should start with the example project, but then they don't get the practice in exercise 2.  Maybe have them start with the sample (which should be called the <em>starter</em> instead of sample) but still make them make their own FOR EACH block? -bh 3/3/22</p>
						<p>How about they start with starter project and you can remind them they can open up song player in another tab to remember the pitches that they used? -pf 3/3/22</p>

								<li>If you want to add or remove a pitch from your list, you don't have to move the other numbers around. To add a new slot, right-click the slot where you want it to appear, and select "insert a slot." To remove a slot, right-click it, and select "delete slot." </li>
