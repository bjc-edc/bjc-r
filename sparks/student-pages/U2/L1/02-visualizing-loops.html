		<h2>Visualizing Loops</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will experiment with <em>loops</em> and see how they control the order in which the commands are run.</div>

		<h3>Using Visible Stepping</h3>
		<p>Snap<em>!</em> has a tool called <strong>Visible Stepping</strong> that allows you to watch Snap<em>!</em> process the blocks of your code in order. </p>

					Open this <a class="js-run snap-project" href="/bjc-r/sparks/prog/U2/lab01/sample-song-player-fur-elise.xml" title="Sample Song Player - Snap! project" target="_blank">Für Elise Example Song</a>, click the Visible Stepping button (<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/visible-stepping.png" alt="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" title="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" />), click the script to play the song, and watch how Visible Stepping shows how the program moves through the nested repeat blocks.<br />
<div class="todo"><p>It feels like Snap speeds up the playback in each subsequent repeat, maybe due to having the audio cached? I felt like it was getting faster and faster. Not sure if thats in my head or not! Also, another Snap music bug- it seems like the final note sometimes persists for way longer, perhaps related to me being in a separate tab. -PF 3/3/22</p><p>Yes, that's by design. ;) There is a <code>change tempo</code> block inside the repeat. I was hoping that students would discuss this script and realize what is happening. I do generally experience weird sound stuff, but not a long last note; I get shortened first notes! I believe Michael thinks that has to do with the way sounds are implemented. --MF, 3/6/22</p><p>TODO: change set tempo to 60 instead of 100 so it builds up more slowly. --MF, 7/6/23</p></div>

		  <div class="todo">What's the point of this box?  Does it say anything that isn't obvious?  That the kids don't already know? --bh 3/3/22</div>Visible Stepping (<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/visible-stepping.png" alt="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" title="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" />) can be useful when reading code because you can see what block is running.</div>

		<h3>Looping Your Song</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<div class="vocab">
					<p>Repeating the same set of commands (such as with <code>repeat</code> or <code>forever</code>) is called <strong>looping</strong> or <strong>iteration</strong>.</p>
				</div>
				<li>If you haven't already, try using the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="repeat () {}" title="repeat () {}" /> block to repeat a note or a sequence of notes in a song. Play your song with Visible Stepping turned on.</li>
				<li>Try nesting one <code>repeat</code> inside another as in the "Für Elise" example above.</li>
				<li>
					Try using a <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever-full-size.png" alt="forever" title="forever" /> block to repeat a command (or group of commands) forever, and play your song with Visible Stepping on.
                    <div class="narrower" style="clear: right;">The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you stop it. You can <strong>click the red stop sign</strong> (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="red stop button" title="red stop button"/>) to stop all scripts in your project from running, or you can click an individual script to stop it.</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you used <em>iteration</em> to repeat a set of commands.
		<div class="todo">What?  You used iteration <em>by repeating</em> a set of commands, if anything.  Does this box really mean "In this activity you learned the word 'iteration'"?  (And, Mary, aren't you the comma minimalist in our gang?)  --bh 3/3/22<p>I'm not sure what the issue is here, Brian. Could you please suggest an alternative? --MF, 3/6/22</p></div>
