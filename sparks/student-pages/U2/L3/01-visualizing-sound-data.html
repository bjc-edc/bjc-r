		<p>
			Snap<em>!</em> can access your computer's microphone, so you can create a virtual <em>oscilloscope</em> that shows how the volume detected by the microphone changes over time.<br />

			<div class="box-head">Sound Waves</div>
			<p>Sound is created by pressure waves traveling through a material (like air or water). When you hear music, an instrument or speaker (think of a vibrating guitar string, a vibrating drum head, or a vibrating speaker) creates waves of pressure that travel through the air to your eardrum, which transmits the signal through your nerves to your brain. Have you ever heard a sound that was so loud you could feel it? Those were pressure waves that were so big you could sense them with more than just your eardrum!</p>

			In Snap<em>!</em>, you can use a sprite as a pen that draws on the stage. To create an oscilloscope, you will need to use drawing blocks. Here are a few that may come in handy:
			<ul>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pen-down-full-size.png" alt="pen down" title="pen down" /> puts the sprite's pen tip down so it can draw on the stage.</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pen-up-full-size.png" alt="pen up" title="pen up" /> picks the sprite's pen tip up so it stops drawing.</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/clear-full-size.png" alt="clear" title="clear" /> clears all pen drawings from the stage.</li>
				<!--<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-0-0-full-size.png" alt="go to x: (0) y:(0)" title="go to x: (0) y:(0)" /> moves the sprite to the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) position typed in the input slots.</li>-->
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-0-0-full-size.png" alt="go to x: (0) y:(0)" title="go to x: (0) y:(0)" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/glide.png" alt="glide (1) secs to x: (0) y:(0)" title="glide (1) secs to x: (0) y:(0)" /> move the sprite to the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) position typed in the input slots. (<code>go</code> does it instantly, and <code>glide</code> lets you see the movement.)</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="endnote">You learned about "Ways to Figure Out Snap<em>!</em> Coordinates" in <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U2/L2/12-choosing-click-areas.html?topic=sparks%2F2-sequencing-iteration.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 2 Lab 2 Activity 12: Choosing Your Click Areas">Lab 2 Activity 12: Choosing Your Click Areas</a></div>
