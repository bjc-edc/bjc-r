When possible, students should select the hardware and software components for their project designs by considering factors such as functionality, cost, size, speed, accessibility, and aesthetics. For example, components for a mobile app could include accelerometer, GPS, and speech recognition. The choice of a device that connects wirelessly through a Bluetooth connection versus a physical USB connection involves a tradeoff between mobility and the need for an additional power source for the wireless device.</li> very well in this lab as it's not covered elsewhere.</div>

			<h4><strong>Sound Waves</strong></h4>
			<p>Sound is created by pressure waves traveling through a material (like air or water). When you hear music, an instrument or speaker (think of a vibrating guitar string, a vibrating drum head, or a vibrating speaker) creates waves of pressure that travel through the air to your eardrum, which transmits the signal through your nerves to your brain. Have you ever heard a sound that was so loud you could feel it? Those were pressure waves that were so big you could sense them with more than just your eardrum!</p>
