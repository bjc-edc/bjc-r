		<div class="todo">Can we cover this here?<li><strong>2-CS-02: Design projects that combine hardware and software components to collect and exchange data.</strong> Collecting and exchanging data involves input, output, storage, and processing. When possible, students should select the hardware and software components for their project designs by considering factors such as functionality, cost, size, speed, accessibility, and aesthetics. For example, components for a mobile app could include accelerometer, GPS, and speech recognition. The choice of a device that connects wirelessly through a Bluetooth connection versus a physical USB connection involves a tradeoff between mobility and the need for an additional power source for the wireless device.</li> </div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will explore the sound data from your computer's microphone and learn to draw in Snap<em>!</em>.</div>

		<p>
			Snap<em>!</em> can access your computer's microphone, so you can create a virtual <em>oscilloscope</em> that shows how the volume detected by the microphone changes over time.<br />

			<h4><strong>Sound Waves</strong></h4>
			<p>Sound is created by pressure waves traveling through a material (like air or water). When you hear music, an instrument or speaker (think of a vibrating guitar string, a vibrating drum head, or a vibrating speaker) creates waves of pressure that travel through the air to your eardrum, which transmits the signal through your nerves to your brain. Have you ever heard a sound that was so loud you could feel it? Those were pressure waves that were so big you could sense them with more than just your eardrum!</p>

			In Snap<em>!</em>, you can use a sprite as a pen that draws on the stage. To create an oscilloscope, you will need to use drawing blocks. Here are a few that may come in handy:
			<ul>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pen-down-full-size.png" alt="pen down" title="pen down" /> puts the sprite's pen tip down so it can draw on the stage</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pen-up-full-size.png" alt="pen up" title="pen up" /> picks the sprite's pen tip up so it stops drawing on the stage</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/clear-full-size.png" alt="clear" title="clear" /> clears all pen drawings from the stage</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/glide.png" alt="glide (1) secs to x: (0) y:(0)" title="glide (1) secs to x: (0) y:(0)" /> moves the sprite to the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) position typed in the input slots</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

<div class="todo">include a description of how to see the Snap<em>!</em> axes
