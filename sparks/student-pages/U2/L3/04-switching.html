		<h2>Switching Back and Forth</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will create a way to switch back and forth easily between your oscilloscope and your spectrum analyzer.</div>

		<p>The oscilloscope plots signal intensity over time, and the spectrum analyzer plots signal intensity over frequency:<br />

							Use an event block together with an <code>if else</code> block <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block to control which visualizer is displayed by pressing a key (such as the space bar). <a href="#hint-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an example of using the global variable to control which visualizer is displayed">Click for an example</a>.
