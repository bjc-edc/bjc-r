		<h2>Switching Back and Forth</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will create a way to switch back and forth easily between your oscilloscope and your spectrum analyzer.</div>

		<p>The oscilloscope plots signal intensity over time, and the spectrum analyzer plots signal intensity over frequency:<br />
