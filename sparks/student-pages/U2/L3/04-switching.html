		<h2>Switching Back and Forth</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will create a way to switch back and forth easily between your oscilloscope and your spectrum analyzer.</div>

		<h3>Time Domain and Frequency Domain</h3>
		<div class="todo">need to sumarize difference between Time Domain and Frequency Domain and to go back and preview it on previous pages</div>

		<h3>Controling the Display with a Toggle</h3>

			<div class="todo">NEED TO TEACH BOOLEANS also need to initialize the toggle.</div>

			<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Predicate</strong> and <strong>Conditional</strong>
				<p>
					A <strong>predicate</strong> is a hexagon-shaped reporter that asks a true/false question such as these examples:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/8-gt-7-reporting-true.png" alt="8 > 7 reporting true" title="8 > 7 reporting true" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/6-gt-7-reporting-false.png" alt="6 > 7 reporting false" title="6 > 7 reporting false" />
				</p>
				<p>
					A <strong>conditional</strong> is a block that controls the code based on a true/false condition (the predicate). The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" /> block is an example of a conditional.
				</p>
			</div>




		<div class="todo">instead of TOGGLE use SHOW SAMPLES?</div>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>
					Create a way to switch back and forth between the oscilloscope code and the spectrum analyzer:
					<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
						<div class="sidenoteBig">
							<p>You learned about event blocks in <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U2/L2/09-responding-events.html?topic=sparks%2F2.2-graphics-animation.topic&course=sparks.html" title="Unit 2 Lab 2 Activity 9: Responding to Events">Unit 2 Lab 2 Activity 9: Responding to Events</a></p>
							<p>You learned about the <code>if else</code> block in <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U2/L1/04-mystery-song-game.html?topic=sparks%2F2-sequencing-iteration.topic&course=sparks.html" title="Unit 2 Lab 1 Activity 4: Mystery Song Game">Unit 2 Lab 1 Activity 4: Mystery Song Game</a>.</p>
						</div>
						<li>Create a global variable (such as <var>toggle</var>) to store a Boolean value that controls whether the programm displays an oscilloscope or a spectrum analyzer.</li>
						<li>
							Use an event block together with an <code>if else</code> block inside the <code>forever</code> block to control which visualizer is displayed by pressing a key (such as the space bar).<br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab03/toggle-when.png" alt="when (space) key pressed: set (toggle) to (not (toggle))" title="when (space) key pressed: set (toggle) to (not (toggle))" />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab03/toggle-forever.png" alt="forever {
	if (toggle) {
		show volume samples
	} else {
		show frewuencies
	}
}" title="forever {
	if (toggle) {
		show volume samples
	} else {
		show frewuencies
	}
}" />
						</li>
						<li>Turn your vizualizer on, and make some noise while you switch back and forth between the oscilloscope and the spectrum analyzer using your toggle.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="todo">Can they do any other interesting variations?? Oh, maybe have them build a way to turn it off completely</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you created a way to switch back and forth easily between your oscilloscope and yout spectrum analyzer by using a key press to toggle between the displays.</div>
