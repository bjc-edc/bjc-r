		<p>Sound is pressure waves, and the patterns of those waves determine what the sound <em>sounds like</em>. In Snap<em>!</em>, sounds can be generated as lists of volume intensities. You'll start by creating one second of "noise", which is just random intensities that sound like static. </p>

					Create a variable called <code>noise</code> to store the intensity values, and make it start as an empty list.<br />
