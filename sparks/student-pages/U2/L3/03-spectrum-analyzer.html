		<h2>Creating a Spectrum Analyzer</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will reuse your oscilloscope code to create a spectrum analyzer.</div>
		<p>
			For the oscilloscope, the horizontal axis showed time, and the vertical axis showed volume intensity (loudness). 
			In a spectrum analyzer, the horizontal axis shows <em>frequency</em>, and the vertical axis still shows volume intensity.<br />

		<h3>Creating the Spectrum Analyzer</h3>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Frequency</strong> and <strong>Spectrum Analyzer</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong>frequency</strong> of a sound is its pitch. High frequencies sound "high" (sharp), and low frequencies sound "low" (boomy).</li>
				<li>An <strong>spectrum analyzer</strong> is an instrument that graphs a signal's intensity at each frequency. You'll create a sound spectrum analyzer that shows the volume of each frequency.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="endnote">
			<p><a href="#hint-frequency" data-toggle="collapse" title="Want to know more about frequency?">Want to know more about frequency?</a></p>
			<div id="hint-frequency" class="collapse">
				<p>Frequency is how often a repeating sound pressure wave repeats. Music (when its more than just percussion) is about playing different frequencies in a way that people enjoy hearing.</p>

			Selecting the <code>samples</code> option from the <code>microphone</code> block makes it report a list of current microphone volume values sampled across a <em>small period of time</em>. Since reports the volumes set of samples over time, you used it to build your oscilloscope. <br />

			Selecting the <code>spectrum</code> option from the <code>microphone</code> block makes it report a list of current microphone volume values across a <em>range of frequencies</em>. Since it reports the volumes of a spectrum of frequencies, you'll use it to build a spectrum analyzer.<br />

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>
					Since you will reuse your oscilloscope code, find the <code>show volume samples</code> block in the palette on the left, right-click it, and select "duplicate block definition..."<br />
					<div class="sidenote"><strong>Don't see "duplicate block definition..."?</strong> Make sure you are clicking the block <em>in the palette on the left</em>.</div>
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab03/duplicate-block-definition.png" alt="show volume samples block with menu open showing 'duplicate block definition...' option selected" title="show volume samples block with menu open showing 'duplicate block definition...' option selected" /><br />
					This will create a new block called <code>show volume samples (2)</code>.
				</li>
				<li>Rename this block <code>show frequencies</code> by clicking on the name of the block in the Block Editor window and changing or deleting the text in the title.</li>
				<li>
					
					Edit the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab03/show-frequencies.png" alt="show frequencies" title="show frequencies" /> block with these critical changes:
					<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
						<li>The second input to the <code>for each</code> block should be <code>microphone (spectrum)</code> instead of <code>microphone (samples)</code> so that it draws the intensity for each frequency in the spectrum instead of the intensity at each sample over time.</li>
						<li>
							Since you'll be plotting the volume of frequencies not volume samples, the first input to the <code>for each</code> block should be <var>frequency</var> instead of <var>volume sample</var>. Be sure to change the variable in the <em>y</em> input for the <code>go to</code> block also.
							<div class="endnote">To rename a variable and all the places it appears <em>at the same time</em>, right-click the variable and choose "rename all..."</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							Finally, that <em>y</em> input to the <code>go to</code> block doesn't need to be scaled up by multiplying by 150, but the value could be lowered (using subtraction) so that the drawing starts near the bottom of the stage (for example, you might subtract 150 instead). <!--(If you lower the drawing with subtraction, lower the starting <em>y</em> value in the <code>go to </code> block also.)-->
							<div class="endnote">To change a block (like <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/times.png" alt="× (times)" title="× (times)" />) to a similar block (like <img class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/minus.png" alt="- (minus)" title="- (minus)" />), right-click the block, and choose "relabel..."</div>
						</li>
						<li>Click "OK" to close the Block Editor.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					Replace the <code>show volume samples</code> block with the <code>show frequencies</code> inside the <code>forever</code> block, and test your code. Make some noise, watch the results, and work with your partner and classmates to debug any issues. The spectrum analyzer should look something like this:<br />

			<ol start="8">
				<li>Try playing a song while you watch your spectrum analyzer.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you changed your oscilloscope into a spectrum analyzer by plotting the intensity of each frequency separately instead of plotting the total intensity across time.</div>
