		<h2>Making Notes and Instruments</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will create notes by repeating a set of frequencies and instruments by changing the frequencies that you repeat.</div>

			In Lab 1: Song Player, you used Snap<em>!</em> to play specific pitches. You can create pitches by repeating a sample of noise. The frequency at which the static repeats will determine the pitch of the note you hear.

		<h3>Making a Note</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="1">
				<li>Open your "Sparks-Making-Noise" project if isn't open already.</li>
				<li>
					Now instead of creating a noise with 44100 frequencies, as you did in the previous activity, create a new variable called <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab05/short-noise.png" alt="short noise" title="short noise" /> and load the list with fewer frequencies (such as 240).
					<div class="endnote">
						<p><a href="#shorter-noise" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for walkthrough images of how to create a shorter noise with fewer frequencies.">Click for walk-through images.</a></p>
						<div id="shorter-noise" class="collapse">
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab05/show-short-noise.png" alt="show variable (short noise)" title="show variable (short noise)" />

			repeat (240) {
				add (pick random (-0.99999) to (1)) to (short noise)

			set (short noise) to (list)
			repeat (240) {
				add (pick random (-0.99999) to (1)) to (short noise)
			}
		}" />
							<p>You'll need to move the watcher on the stage to see all variables at the same time.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					Then create another variable called <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab05/repeated-short-noise.png" alt="repeated short noise" title="repeated short noise" />, add enough copies of the frequencies from <var>short noise</var> to make one second of sound, and play <var>repeated short noise</var>. The repeated short noise sample should sound more like a note than the plain noise in the last activity did.

		<h3>Making Other Notes</h3>
		<div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="6">
				<div class="sidenoteBig">If your Snap<em>!</em> stage gets too crowded with variable watchers, use the <code>show variable</code> and <code>hide variable</code> blocks to control which watchers are displayed.</div>
				<li>Create a two new variables, <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab05/shorter-noise.png" alt="shorter noise" title="shorter noise" /> and <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab05/repeated-shorter-noise.png" alt="repeated shorter noise" title="repeated shorter noise" />.</li>
				<li>Load the <var>shorter noise</var> variable with even fewer frequencies (such as 60).</li>
				<li>Add enough copies of <var>shorter noise</var> to <var>repeated shorter noise</var> to make  one second of sound, and play <var>repeated shorter noise</var>. It should sound higher in pitch than the <var>short noise</var>.</li>
				<div class="endnote">A shorter length of repeated sound means that the sound will be repeated more frequently, which makes for a higher frequency.</div>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Making Other Instruments</h3>
		<div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="9">
				<li>
					Change the way the notes sound by changing the frequencies in the short sample that gets repeated. For example, you might make <var>square sample</var> and <var>repeated square sample</var> variables and load the sample with 60 negative values followed by 60 positive values to make a "square wave":<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab05/generator-square.png" alt="warp {
	set (square sample) to (list)
	repeat (60) {
		add (-0.5) to (square sample)
	}
	repeat (60) {
		add (0.5) to (square sample)
	}
}" title="warp {
	set (square sample) to (list)
	repeat (60) {
		add (-0.5) to (square sample)
	}
	repeat (60) {
		add (0.5) to (square sample)
	}
}" /><br />
					Or you might have the values in the short sample start negative and then go up slowly.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab05/generator-sawtooth.png" alt="warp {
	set (sawtooth sample) to (list)
	for (-50) to (50) {
		add (i / 100) to (sawtooth sample)
	}
}" title="warp {
	set (sawtooth sample) to (list)
	for (-50) to (50) {
		add (i / 100) to (sawtooth sample)
	}
}" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab05/sawtooth-sample-watcher.png" alt="sawtooth variable watcher showing a list containing 101 items: {-0.5, -0.49, -0.48, -0.47, -0.46, -0.45, -0.44, -0.43, ...}" title="sawtooth variable watcher showing a list containing 101 items: {-0.5, -0.49, -0.48, -0.47, -0.46, -0.45, -0.44, -0.43, ...}" />

		<h3>Visualizing Your Own Sounds</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="10">
				<li>
					<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
					Run your oscilloscope or the spectrum analyzer while you play some of the notes and instruments you created. How does the visualization correspond with what you hear?</li>
