			<h4><strong>Each Sprite Has Its Own Wardrobe</strong></h4>
			<p>The costumes you add will appear in the wardrobe of the sprite that you currently have selected. If you add other sprites, you'll have to give them their own costumes. Whichever sprite you have selected, you'll only be able to see the costumes for that sprite.</p>
			<h4><strong>Each Sprite Also Has Its Own Code</strong></h4>
			<p>As with costumes, the <em>code</em> you add will appear in the <em>scripting area</em> of the sprite that you currently have selected. If you add other sprites, you'll have to give them their own <em>code</em>, and whichever sprite you have selected, you'll only be able to see the <em>code</em> for that sprite.</p>
