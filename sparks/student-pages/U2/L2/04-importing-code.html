		<h2>Importing Code</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll incorporate blocks from other projects.</div>
		<p>
			Some blocks you've used are built into Snap<em>!</em>. For example:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/map.png" alt="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" title="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="repeat () {}" title="repeat () {}" />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join.png" alt="join () ()" title="join () ()" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Other blocks you've used are custom blocks that were developed for this course. For example:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello.png" alt="say hello to () in ('English')" title="say hello to () in ('English')" />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab04/rgb-pixel.png" alt="RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255)" title="RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255)" />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/ask.png" alt="ask ()" title="ask ()" />
		</p>
		<p>
			And you've created some blocks of your own that aren't built into Snap<em>!</em>. For example:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/mystery-song.png" alt="mystery song" title="mystery song" />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab05/message-shifted-by.png" alt="message () shifted by ()" title="message () shifted by ()" />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/responses-only.png" alt="responses only from survey 'list input slot'" title="responses only from survey 'list input slot'" />
		</p>
		<p>When you want to use a block that isn't available in your current project, you can open a project where you already have that block, export it (save it to your computer), open the project where you want the block, and import it (upload it from your computer).</p>
