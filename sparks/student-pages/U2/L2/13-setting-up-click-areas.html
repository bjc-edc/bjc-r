		<h2>Setting Up Your Click Areas</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will create a predicate expression to check whether the mouse is in your click area(s).</div>
		<div class="vocab">

				A <strong>predicate</strong> is a hexagon-shaped reporter that asks a true/false question.
			</p>
			<div class="endnote">You learned about predicates in <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L6/02-l33t-text.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=sparks.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 6 Activity 2: L33t Text" target="_blank">Unit 1 Lab 6 Activity 2: L33t Text</a>.</div>

		<p>
			When the user clicks the stage, your program should check whether the mouse is in any of your click areas.
			You can use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-x.png" alt="mouse x" title="mouse x" /> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/mouse-y.png" alt="mouse y" title="mouse y" /> from the "Sensing" palette to check.
		</p>
		<p>
			The following example <em>predicate</em> expression checks if the <em>x</em> position of the mouse is between -80 and -240 and also if the the <em>y</em> position is between 180 and 60. That is, it tests whether the mouse is in the yellow section of the stage shown in the picture of the stage shown below.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/example-predicate.png" alt="(-80 > mouse x > -240) and (180 > mouse y > 60)" title="(-80 > mouse x > -240) and (180 > mouse y > 60)" /><br />
			<img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/xy-grid-show-click-area2.png" alt="picture of Snap! stage with area between x=-80 and x=-240 and between y=180 and y=60 highlighted on top of 'XY Grid' stage Background" title="picture of Snap! stage with area between x=-80 and x=-240 and between y=180 and y=60 highlighted on top of 'XY Grid' stage Background" />
		</p>
		<p>Whenever the user clicks the stage, you can use an predicate expression like this to test whether they clicked in one of your click areas and use the result to decide whether to perform an action (such as an animation or sound).</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo" style="clear: right;">
			<ol>
				<li>
					Choose one of the click areas you already defined, and build a predicate expression that reports <code>true</code> only when the mouse is in your click area.
					<div class="endnote">
							If you click the right-facing triangle in an inequality block, can can compare multiple values in the same block. <br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/greater-than-arrowhead-circled.png" alt="> block with a circle around the right-facing triangle" title="> block with a circle around the right-facing triangle" />
							<span class="" style="font-size:20px;">&rightarrow;</span>
							<img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/greater-than-expanded.png" alt="() > () > ()" title="() > () > ()" />
						<p><a href="#hint-built-in" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a tip about checking your predicate.">Click for a tip about checking your predicate.</a></p>
						<div id="hint-built-in" class="collapse">
							<p>
								You can check if your predicate is working by creating a script that makes the sprite follow your mouse around the stage and say <code>true</code> when your mouse is within the click area defined by your expression and <code>false</code> when it isn't. For example: <br />
								<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/predicate-check-code.png" alt="forever {
	go to x: (mouse x) y: (mouse y)
	say ()
}" title="forever {
	go to x: (mouse x) y: (mouse y)
	say ()
}" /><br />
								Here's what it might look like with a predicate expression inside the <code>say</code> block:<br />
								<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/predicate-check-code-example.png" alt="forever {
	go to x: (mouse x) y: (mouse y)
	say ((-80 > mouse x > -240) and (180 > mouse y > 60))
}" title="forever {
	go to x: (mouse x) y: (mouse y)
	say ((-80 > mouse x > -240) and (180 > mouse y > 60))
}" />
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</li>

				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" /></li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="ifTime show">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>Create additional predicate expressions for other click areas.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you designed a predicate expression that checks whether the mouse is inside your click area.</div>
