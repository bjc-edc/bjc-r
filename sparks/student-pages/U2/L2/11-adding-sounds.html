		<h2>Adding Sounds</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll add sounds to your interactive project.</div>

		<p>Just as with images, you have several options for adding sound to your project. You can use sounds built into Snap<em>!</em>, you can record your own sounds, you can import a sound file from your computer, or you can use Snap<em>!</em> to create music like you did in <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U2/L1/01-playing-notes.html?topic=sparks%2F2-sequencing-iteration.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Lab 1: Song Player">Lab 1: Song Player</a>.</p>

		<h3>Revisiting Your Plan and Setting Up</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Review your project plan. What kind of sounds make sense for your project? When should the sounds play?</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/headphones.png" alt="Set Up Your Headphones or Speakers" title="Set Up Your Headphones or Speakers" /></li>
				<li>Drag a <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-volume-to-100.png" alt="set volume to () %" title="set volume to () %" /> block onto the stage in case you need to adjust the volume.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			There are two kinds of sounds in Snap<em>!</em>: <strong>sound recordings</strong> (stored in the "Sounds" tab) and <strong>songs made by playing notes</strong> as the computer runs your program.</p><p>In Lab 1, you made songs by playing notes, and to hear them, you clicked a custom block made for this course, such as <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/play-emoji-note.png" alt="play ♪ pitch: () beats: ()" title="play ♪ pitch: () beats: ()" /> or <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab01/play-song.png" alt="play song ()" title="play song ()" />.</p>
		<p>
			To play sound recordings, you'll use either of these blocks from the "Sound" menu:
			<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/play-sound.png" alt="play sound ()" title="play sound ()" /> or
			<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/play-sound-until-done.png" alt="play sound () until done" title="play sound () until done" />.
			<div class="endnote">You'll notice the difference between these two new blocks if you snap two or more of them together. The <code>play sound</code> block starts playing the sound while the computer <em>keeps going</em> through the blocks in your code. So, multiple sounds may play at the same time. The <code>play sound until done</code> block doesn't let the computer move on to the next block in the script until the current song finishes playing.</div>
