		<h2>Responding to Events</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will make your project interactive by making the code respond to user events.</div>
		<p>So far, your animation has only played when you (the programmer) click the script. You can use <em>events</em> to tell the the computer to run your code when something happens (such as when the user clicks something).</p>
		<div class="vocabBig">
			<p>An <strong>event</strong> is something that happens, such as clicking on a sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-green-flag.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>) that tells the computer to do something.</p>
		</div>
		<p>In Snap<em>!</em>, blocks that look like this can be used to detect an event:
		    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-i-am-clicked.png" alt="when i am (clicked)" title="when i am (clicked)" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-green-flag-clicked-full-size.png" alt="when 'green flag' clicked" title="when 'green flag' clicked" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-space-key-pressed.png" alt="when (space) key pressed" title="when (space) key pressed" />
		</p>
        <p>Event blocks go only on top of a script (as a way to tell the script to start), so Snap<em>!</em> programmers call them "hat blocks." </p>

		<h3>Revisiting Your Plan</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<div class="sidenoteBig">The green flag button in the top right corner of the Snap<em>!</em> window is one way for the user of your interactive project to start the program.</div>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Revisit your plan for the animation in your interactive project. What user action (such as clicking a sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag (<img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-green-flag.png" alt="green flag button" title="green flag button" />) will make your animation(s) happen?</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h3>Adding Hat Blocks to Make Your Code Respond to Events</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>
					Add the hat block that you want at the top of the code for your animation.
					<div class="endnote">
						<div class="box-head"><a href="#hint-which-hat-block" data-toggle="collapse" title="Which hat block should you choose?">Which hat block should you choose?</a></div>
						<div id="hint-which-hat-block" class="collapse">
							<ul>
								<li>The <img class="hatblock" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-space-key-pressed.png" alt="when (space) key pressed" title="when (space) key pressed" /> block runs the attached code whenever the key selected in the block's dropdown menu is pressed. </li>
								<li>The <img class="hatblock" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-green-flag-clicked-full-size.png" alt="when 'green flag' clicked" title="when 'green flag' clicked" /> block runs the attached code whenever the green flag button (<img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-green-flag.png" alt="green flag button" title="green flag button" />) is clicked.</li>
								<li>
									The pronoun "I" in <img class="hatblock" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-i-am-clicked.png" alt="when i am (clicked)" title="when i am (clicked)" /> refers to the sprite that you currently have selected. Whenever the action selected in the block's dropdown menu is performed on that sprite (such as when it is clicked, pressed, dropped, etc.), this block runs its attached code.<br />
									<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/when-i-am-clicked-menu-open.png" alt="When I am (clicked) block with the menu open showing 8 choices: clicked, pressed, dropped, mouse-entered, mouse-departed, scrolled-up, scrolled-down, stopped" title="When I am (clicked) block with the menu open showing 8 choices: clicked, pressed, dropped, mouse-entered, mouse-departed, scrolled-up, scrolled-down, stopped" />
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>Check that your animation works as you want it to.</li>
				<li>
					If you have more than one animation, add additional hat blocks to make them run. For example:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/when-clicked-spin.png" alt="when I am (clicked) {
	spin in a circle
}" title="when I am (clicked) {
	spin in a circle
}" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/when-departed-fade.png" alt="when I am (mouse-departed) {
	fade away
}" title="when I am (mouse-departed) {
	fade away
}" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/when-entered-clear-effects.png" alt="when I am (mouse-entered) {
	clear graphic effects
}" title="when I am (mouse-entered) {
	clear graphic effects
}" />
				</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" /></li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="takeItFurther">
			<ol type="A">
				<li>Experiment with other hat blocks:
					<ul>
						<li>The <img class="hatblock" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-i-receive.png" alt="when I receive ()" title="when I receive ()" /> block works together with <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/broadcast.png" alt="broadcast ()" title="broadcast ()" />. You can put the <code>broadcast</code> block anywhere in your code and set it to broadcast any message you like. When that message is broadcast, any <code>when I receive</code> block that has that message selected will run its attached code.</li>
						<li>
							<div class="sidenoteBig">You learned about predicates in <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L6/02-l33t-text.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=sparks.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 6 Activity 2: L33t Text" target="_blank">Unit 1 Lab 6 Activity 2: L33t Text</a>.</div>
							The <img class="hatblock" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-predicate-input.png" alt="when ()" title="when ()" /> takes a predicate expression (true/false statement) as input and will run its attached code when that predicate is true. For example: <br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/when-touching-mouse.png" alt="when (touching (mouse-pointer) ?)" title="when (touching (mouse-pointer) ?)" />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/when-xgt0.png" alt="when (x position > 0)" title="when (x position > 0)" />
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
