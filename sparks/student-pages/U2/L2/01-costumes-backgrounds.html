		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will learn about sprites (characters) and their costumes as well as the Snap<em>!</em> stage and its background.</div>

		<div class="sidenote">You first learned about sprites, costumes, and the Snap<em>!</em> stage in <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L4/03-investigating-and-storing-images.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 4 Activity 3: Investigating and Storing Images">Unit 1 Lab 4 Activity 3: Investigating and Storing Images</a>.</div>

		<p>Your project should have characters or objects that move around (<em>sprites</em>) on top of a background image (the Snap<em>!</em> <em>stage</em>). You'll control how the sprites look by changing their <em>costumes</em>, and you'll control how the stage looks by changing its <em>background</em>. </p>
		<p>
			Here are a few of the costumes included in Snap<em>!</em>. You can also import your own.<br />

				<li>The <strong>stage</strong> is the big rectangle in the upper right of the Snap<em>!</em> window. (It's white when you first open Snap<em>!</em>.) The stage is what users of your project see, and it's where your sprites live.</li>
