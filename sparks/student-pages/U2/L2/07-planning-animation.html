		<h2>Planning your Animation</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will decide what kind of animation you want in your project.</div>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Revisit your plan for the animation in your interactive project.
					<ul>
						<li>Will the stage background ever change?</li>
						<li>
							<div class="sidenoteBig">
								You can create animation by changing costumes. <em>This sprite isn't moving</em>; it just has four costumes and is changing between them using this script:<br />
								<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab02/avery-walking-script.png" alt="forever {
	next costume
	wait (0.1) secs
}" title="forever {
	next costume
	wait (0.1) secs
}" />
							</div>
							Will the sprite(s) ever change costumes?<br />
							<img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab02/avery-walking-animation.gif" alt="animation of a cartoon character walking that has been created by changing between four different costumes" title="animation of a cartoon character walking that has been created by changing between four different costumes" />
							<div class="endnote">There is a gray "play" button in the middle of the image above and also a few images below. If you click an image with a play button once, an animation will play. If you click it again, the animation will stop.</div>

						</li>
						<li>
							Will the sprite(s) move, change size, or turn? If they move, how will they move (instantly vs. slowly, change direction)?<br />
							<img class="indent noshadow" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/bug-animation.gif" alt="animation of a cartoon bug rotating, shrinking, and then moving" title="animation of a cartoon bug rotating, shrinking, and then moving" />
						</li>
						<li>
							Will the sprite(s) say or think anything?<br />
							<img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/middle-school/img/U2/lab02/dee-talking-animation.gif" alt="animation of a cartoon character with a thought bubble thinking, 'Hmmm... we are out of bread,' and then with a speech bubble saying 'Hey, do you need anything from the store?'" title="animation of a cartoon character with a thought bubble thinking, 'Hmmm... we are out of bread,' and then with a speech bubble saying 'Hey, do you need anything from the store?'" />
						</li>
						<li>
							Will there be any special effects (such as fading out or changing color)?
							<div class="todo">Add some animations here.</div>
							<div class="endnote">
								Special effects are changes to the way a sprite costume (or stage background) appears. You can explore the different effects by opening the menu of the <code>change effect</code> block located in the "Looks" palette and using a little script like this to cycle through the levels of an effect and then reset it to no effect.<br />
								<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/change-effect.png" alt="change (color) effect by (10) block with effect menu open showing these effect options: color, saturation, brightness, ghost, fisheye, whirl, pixelate, mosaic, negative" title="change (color) effect by (10) block with effect menu open showing these effect options: color, saturation, brightness, ghost, fisheye, whirl, pixelate, mosaic, negative" />
								<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/change-effect-script.png" alt="repeat (10) {
	change (color) effect by (10)
	wait (0.2) secs
}
set (color) effect to (0)
" title="repeat (10) {
	change (color) effect by (10)
	wait (0.2) secs
}
set (color) effect to (0)
" />
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>Will any sprites look at or follow the mouse or another sprite?
							<div class="todo">Add an animation here.</div>
						</li>
						<li>Will any sprites leave a path showing where they've been?
							<div class="todo">Add an animation here.</div>
						</li>
					</ul>
