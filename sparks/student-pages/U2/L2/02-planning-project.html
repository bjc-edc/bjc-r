		<h2>Planning Your Interactive Project</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will plan an interactive Snap<em>!</em> project (such as a poster, a card, or a cartoon) and seek input from other people to improve your plan.</div>
		<h3>New Snap<em>!</em> Skills</h3>

		<p>
			Your project should use each of the following features:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Costumes and Backgrounds:</strong> You can use images included in Snap<em>!</em>, import images, or draw your own.</li>
				<li><strong>Animation:</strong> You'll can make your sprites move around, say things, and change costumes.</li>
				<li><strong>Events:</strong> Your project can do things when something happens (such as play a sound when something is clicked).</li>
				<li><strong>Importing Code:</strong> You'll incorporate blocks from prior projects.</li>
				<li><strong>Sounds:</strong> You'll add or create audio recordings.</li>
				<li><strong>Click Areas:</strong> You'll create special areas on the stage where a user's click will make something happen.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Making Your Plan</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo" style="clear: right;">
			<ol>
				<li>Decide on the <em>purpose</em> and <em>design</em> of your interactive project. Is it a poster, a greeting card, or a cartoon? Who is it for? Is it for fun or for learning? Is there a theme?</li>
				<div class="endnote">
					<p><a href="#hint-project-example" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an example of an interactive project.">Click for an example.</a></p>
					<div id="hint-project-example" class="collapse">
						Click the image to play the animation that shows an interative poster about the eight planets and Pluto.<br />
						<img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U2/lab02/example-project.gif" alt="example of an interactive project: The stage background shows 8 planets and Pluto, and the mouse clicks one planet at a time. When it does, the sprite moves to that planet and says a fact or two about the planet." title="example of an interactive project: The stage background shows 8 planets and Pluto, and the mouse clicks one planet at a time.

					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sidenoteBig">It's normal to change your plans as you start creating, but it's helpful to have a plan before you start.</div>
				<li>Your project should use each of the new skills you will learn in this lab (costumes, animation, events, importing code, sounds, and click areas). Decide how your project will use each skill you will learn.</li>
				<li>Draw a sketch of what your interactive project will look like.</li>
				<li>
					<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />Share the plan for your interactive project with other people and ask for their feedback. What could make the project more fun, more useful, easier to use, or more appropriate for the intended audience?
				</li>
				<li>Review the feedback you've collected and make any improvements your project plan that make sense to you.</li>
				<div class="endnote">
					<h4><strong>Why gather feedback?</strong></h4>
					<p>Have you ever used an app that it was annoying or hard to use? The programmers may not have had those problems when they used it, but you are a different person. Creating good software requires getting input from different kinds of people.</p>
				</div>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you planned your interactive project and gathered feedback on your plan and made improvements.</div>
