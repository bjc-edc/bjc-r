		<h2>L33t Text</h2>
		<div class="todo">If this splits into three pages, any reason not to make it into it's own lab? (That would make it different than the SIGCSE paper though...) --MF, 1/10/23</div>

		<div class="learn">
			In this activity, youâ€™ll make your own text processing block by using a new block that tells the program to report specific things in specific cases:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" />
		</div>


		<h3>What is L33t?</h3>
		<p>In the 1980s, the Internet was mostly text-based. Similarly to how today we use emojis ðŸ¦Š ðŸš² and abbreviations (like LMK or LOL) to embellish messages, early Internet users (and some gamers today) used a modified spelling called <em>leet</em> (meaning, "elite") where certain letters are replaced with numbers that look similar (such as replacing "s" with "5" or "e" with "3").</p>
		<p>
			For example, can you read this text?<br />
			<pre class="indent">1 w4nt t0 g0 t0 5ch001 34rly t0d4y.</pre>
		</p>
		<p>You're going to build a <code>l33t</code> block that converts just one specific letter to a number (such as just changing "e" to "3").<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab06/l33t-change-e-to-3-reporting.png" alt="l33t (I have dance class at eight on Tuesday.) reporting 'I hav3 danc3 class at 3ight on Tu3sday.'" title="l33t (I have dance class at eight on Tuesday.) reporting 'I hav3 danc3 class at 3ight on Tu3sday.'" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Your block will need to need to:
			<ul>
				<li>Split the input text into a list of letters by using <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/split-by-letter.png" alt="split () by (letter)" title="split () by (letter)" />.</li>
				<li>Apply a letter-changing function to every matching letter by using <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/map.png" alt="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" title="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" />.</li>
				<li>Join the modified list of letters back into a single text string by using <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join.png" alt="join () ()" title="join () ()" />.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>You've already learned how to use <code>map</code> to apply a function to every item in a list, and how to use <code>join</code> to join elements of a list into a single text string. The missing ingredient is a letter-changing function.</p>
		<div class="todo"><h1>Consder Page Break Here</h1><p>And add "Write out a sentence in L33T (on paper)" and then "See id you can read someone elses." exercises to the end of the first page above.</p></div>


		<h3>Creating a Letter-Changing Function</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Open your "Texting Time" project, if it isn't open already.</li>
				<li>
					Decide which letter of the alphabet you want to change into a number, and create a new <code>change for letter</code> block that takes one input called <var>letter</var>. This block will decide whether to change one letter at a time. For example, if you were changing "e" to "3", your new block would look like this:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab06/change-e-to-3-starter.png" alt="change e to 3 for letter (letter) hat block with report () attached" title="change e to 3 for letter (letter) hat block with report () attached" />

						<div id="hint-new-block" class="collapse">
							<p>
								<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
									<li>Right-click (or control-click on a Mac) in an empty spot in the Scripts area and choose "make a block..."</li>
									<li>Choose the color for your block.</li>
									<li>Type the title text for your block (for example, "change e to 3 for letter").</li>
									<li>Select the shape for your block.</li>
									<li>Click "OK."</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
						</div>
						<p><a href="#hint-local-vars" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a reminder about how make a block take an input.">Click for a reminder about how make a block take an input.</a></p>
						<div id="hint-local-vars" class="collapse">
							<p>
								<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
									<li>Hold your mouse pointer at the point in the text text of the hat block in the block editor where you want the input slot to appear, and click the plus sign that appears.</li>
									<li>Type the name of the variable you want to add (such as <code>letter</code>), and press "OK."</li>
									<li>To use this new local variable in your code, drag off a copy from the hat block, drop it into your code.</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</li>

			You can use the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" /> block to decide which thing to report. The <code>if then else</code> block takes three inputs:
			<ul>
				<li>
				A <em>predicate</em> (a hexagon-shaped testing function that reports either true or false). For example:
				<img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab06/letter=e.png" alt="(letter) = (e)" title="(letter) = (e)" />
				</li>
				<li>An output to report if the predicate is true.</li>
				<li>An output to report if the predicate is false.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Predicate</strong> and <strong>Conditional</strong>
			<p>
                A <strong>predicate</strong> is a hexagon-shaped reporter that asks a true/false question such as these examples:<br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/8-gt-7-reporting-true.png" alt="8 > 7 reporting true" title="8 > 7 reporting true" />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/6-gt-7-reporting-false.png" alt="6 > 7 reporting false" title="6 > 7 reporting false" />
            </p>
			<p>
				A <strong>conditional</strong> is a block that controls the code based on a true/false condition (the predicate). The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" /> block is an example of a conditional.

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>Use <code>if then else</code> to write code for your <code>change for letter</code> block that will test whether the input letter matches the letter you want to change into a number, and if it does, reports the number, and if it doesn't, reports the input letter without changing it.</li>
				<li>
					Test your <code>change for letter</code> block with your chosen letter and with other letters.<br />

					<h4><strong>Duplicating a Block</strong></h4>
					<p>To easily make a new block that is similar to your letter-changing function (such as <code>change e to 3 for letter</code>), you don't need to start all over again. Instead, just right-click on the block name <em>in the palette on the left</em> and select "duplicate".</p>
					<p>That will create a new block (such as <code>change e to 3 for letter (2)</code>) and open it for you in the block editor. You can click the text in the hat block to change the name. Then create the code for your new block.</p>

							<span class="" style="font-size:1.5em;">â†’</span> <br />

						</li>
						<li>Replace multiple letters at once by <em>nesting</em> multiple letter-changing functions.</li>
