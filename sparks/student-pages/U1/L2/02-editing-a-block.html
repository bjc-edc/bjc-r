		<h2>Editing a Block</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you will customize the story by changing the words reported by one of the <code>random</code> reporter blocks.</div>
			
		<p>Some blocks are built into Snap<em>!</em> and can't be changed, but Snap<em>!</em> programmers (including you!) can also make and edit their own custom blocks. The <code>random</code> blocks in this project are custom blocks that you can edit.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em> and open your "Super Short Stories" project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
				<li>
					Choose one of the <code>random</code> blocks (<code>random job</code>, <code>random action</code>, or <code>random animal</code>), right-click it (or control-click it, if you're on a Mac), and select "editâ€¦" from the menu that appears. This will open the "Block Editor."
					<div class="endnote">
						<strong>Tip:</strong>
							<a href="#hint-edit" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an image that shows how to open the 'Block Editor.'">Click for an image that shows how to open the "Block Editor."</a>
							<div id="hint-edit" class="collapse"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/edit-block-in-dropdown.png" alt="'random job' block with right-click menu open and the 'edit...' option highlighted at the very bottom of the menu" title="'random job' block with right-click menu open and the 'edit...' option highlighted at the very bottom of the menu" /></div>
					</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			In the "Block Editor," you can see that this custom block called <code>random job</code> reports a random item from a list of jobs.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/random-job-block-editor.png" alt="random job: {report (item (random) of (list (artist) (computer programmer) (cashier) (musician) (landscaper) (nurse) (plumber)))}" title="random job: {report (item (random) of (list (artist) (computer programmer) (cashier) (musician) (landscaper) (nurse) (plumber)))}" />
		</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>
					Customize the block by changing some of the items in the list. (That is, change some of the jobs to other jobs, some of the actions to other actions, or some of the places to other places, etc.)
					<div class="endnote"><strong>Tip:</strong> You can also <em>add</em> more items to the list or reduce the number of items in the list by clicking the arrows at the end of the list block (&#9668; &#9658;).</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					When you are finished editing, click the "OK" button, and click the block that you edited several times to make sure that it reports a random item from the list you edited.
					<div class="endnote"><strong>Tip:</strong> If it doesn't work right, edit the block again <em>and also</em> edit another one of the <code>random</code> blocks <em>at the same time</em>. Compare the code for your edited <code>random</code> block that isn't working to the code from the <code>random</code> block that is working.</div>
				</li>
				<li>Once you have revised <code>random</code> block that works, try it out in your <code>super short story</code> block.</li>

		<div class="ifTime show">
			<ol start="7">
				<li>Edit another <code>random</code> block to customize the story further.</li>
