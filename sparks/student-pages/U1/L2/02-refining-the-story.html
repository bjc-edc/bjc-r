		<h2>Refining the Story</h2>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>There were a lot of fill-in-the-blank prompts in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12GtjpO8cawrWDrR-qTwy4kRTn3M4kF6WW-hW_x7JWtk/edit" title="Activity 2: Refining the Story Google Doc" target="_blank">Refining the Story Google Doc</a>. How are we going to handle that for the HTML version? --MF, 8/11/21<br />Any ideas, anyone? --MF, 8/20/21</p>
			<p>Next revision: this page should be split into at least three shorter pages, and the vocab box about abstraction should be cut down considerably. --MF, 2/9/22</p>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll use operator functions to generate random numbers and to join letters together to make new words to improve the story.</div>

		<h3>Using a Random Number</h3>
		<p>
			Notice that the input slot for numbers is a different shape. In Snap<em>!</em>, the shape of an input slot tells you what kind of input you can put in that slot. A rectangle will accept any kind of text (letters, numbers, punctuation, emojis, etc.), but an oval will only accept a number. <br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/super-short-story.png" alt="Super Short Story, feeling: (happy) job: (teacher) action: (jumps) place: (Central Park) action: (races) number: (7) color: (red) plural animal: (cats) food: (stir fry)" title="Super Short Story, feeling: (happy) job: (teacher) action: (jumps) place: (Central Park) action: (races) number: (7) color: (red) plural animal: (cats) food: (stir fry)" />
		</p>

		<p>You've used special <code>random</code> blocks that were designed especially for this project to generate random feelings, jobs, actions, places, etc. Programming languages (including Snap<em>!</em>) have a built-in way to generate random numbers.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em> and open your "Super Short Stories" project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
				<li>Locate <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-1-to-10-full-size.png" alt="pick random (1) to (10)" title="pick random (1) to (10)" /> in the palette on the left hand side of the Snap<em>!</em> window, drag it into the Scripts area, and click it a few times.
				<div class="todo">They could just click on the block in the palette without dragging it out; is there a reason not to teach that? -bh</div>
				</li>
				<li>Change the inputs to <code>pick random number</code> a few times, and each time you do, click it a few times to see what happens.
				<div class="todo">Do you want to specify whole number inputs?  (Or, alternatively, suggest they also try decimal-fraction inputs?) -bh</div>
				</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Describe what the <code>pick random number</code> block does.</li>
				<li>
					Drag <code>pick random number</code> into the number input slot of <code>Super Short Story</code>, and run that block a few times to verify that a random number is used in the story. If it isn't working right, work with another student to sort out the problem.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/super-short-story-pick-random.png" alt="'super story story' block with 'pick random (3) to (12)' in the 'number' input slot" title="'super story story' block with 'pick random (3) to (12)' in the 'number' input slot" />

		</div>

		<h3>Editing the Inputs with <code>Join</code></h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="6">
				<li>If you haven't used the <code>random animal</code> block, try it in the animal input slot of the <code>Super Short Story</code> block now. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair.png" alt="Talk with Another Pair" title="Talk with Another Pair" /> What is a potential problem with using this block in this story?<div class="todo"><p>The talk thing is awkwardly large and affects the line height funnily, maybe just the short icon? -- PF 8/20/21</p><p>I'm not sure what you mean by a "short icon" but here are some thoughts... --MF, 8/20/21<ol><li>We could redesign the icons; the originals are in /bjc-r/img/icons/icons.ai.

I think that's OK, but it's worth noting.</li><li>We could use class="imageRight" instead of "inline" but I do like using the icon as part of the text...</li></ol></p></div></li>
				<li><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Find the <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join()().png" alt="join" title="join" /> block in the palette and drag it into the Scripts area. Click it, change the inputs, and click it again. What does the <code>join</code> block do?</li>
				<li>
					Drag the <code>random animal</code> block into the first slot of the <code>join</code> block and type an "s" in the second slot. Click it to test that it reports a plural animal, and then drag the entire <code>join</code> expression into the <code>Super Short Story</code> block.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/join-random-animal-s.png" alt="join (random animal) (s)" title="join (random animal) (s)" />

				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work" /></li>
				<li>Share your project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>), selecting this project from the list, pressing "Share," and clicking "Cancel". Then copy the URL (web address) out of the location bar at the top of the window, and send it to your friends, family, and/or teacher.</li>

		<div class="todo"><h1>Page Break here</h1><p>So they have a page named "Creating a Block". Need to review why the next page is called "Creating and Editing Blocks" (I think that's a mistake.) --MF, 1/11/23</div>

		<h3>Creating a Block</h3>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Abstraction</strong>
			<div class="commentBig"><p>Will they be watching a video on abstraction here? Or does Dan mention it in welcome? It feels so..abstract..here that I wonder what students will take from it. If I wasn't bound to use the term abstraction, I'd probably emphasize the benefit of reuse "When we realize we've developed a useful piece of functionality that we might want to use in other places, we can turn it into its own block." Anyway just musings from your local "abstraction" skeptic, feel free to delete. -- PF 8/20/21</p><p>I added your text at the beginning and am open to a Dan video and/or more discussion about teaching abstraction. :) --MF, 8/20/21</p></div>
			<p>When you realize you've developed a useful piece of script behavior that you might want to use in other places, you can turn it into its own block. This is a form of <em>abstraction</em>.</p>
			<p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is an important idea in computer science. One kind of abstraction is breaking up a large problem into smaller sub-problems.</p>
			<p>For example, instead of putting <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/join-random-animal-s.png" alt="join (random animal) (s)" title="join (random animal) (s)" /> into an input slot of <code>super short story</code>, you can create a <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/plural-of.png" alt="plural of ()" title="plural of ()" /> block and put <code>random animal</code> in its input slot.</p>
			<p>This makes your code easier to read, you can use this new block again in other places, and once the block is working, you don't need to think about <em>how</em> it works each time you use it.  (For example, you might later improve <code>plural</code> to handle words such as "fly" and "box" that don't form their plural just by adding an "s.")</p>

				<li>
                    Make a new block.

			You are creating a reporter, so the block editor opens with a <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/report.png" alt="report" title="report" /> block already attached to the <code>plural </code> hat block. Whatever input you give to the <code>report</code> block will become the value reported by your new block.<br />

		<div class="todo"><h1>Page Break</h1><p>I think this should be yet another page called "Adding an Input to Your Block" so that this page isn't so long, and that so students and teachers can easily refer back to where they learned these critical skills. --MF, 1/11/23</p></div>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
		  <div class="todo">Why do you prefer the Plain Prototype Labels mode?  We put a lot of thought into the visible plus signs in the default mode, mainly because it makes the process of adding inputs <i>discoverable,</i> whereas it's pretty hard to hover in just the right place to make an invisible plus sign become visible and then click it.  I made Jens add the invisible-plus option only for the sake of making script pics for the manual and other documentation, not as a good way for users to use Snap<i>!.</i> -bh<p>We've talked about this. ;) It's great in Snap!, but it doesn't offer anything except clutter in a static image. --MF, 1/11/23</p></div>
			<ol start="12">
				<li>
					Add an input slot for the word that will be made plural.
					<div class="vocabBig">
						<p>
							<strong>Hat blocks</strong> tell you when a piece of code should be run and what (if any) inputs it takes.<br />

					<ol>
						<li>
							Hold your mouse pointer right after the word "of" in the <code>plural</code> <em>hat block</em>, and click the plus sign that appears.<br />

				<li>
					Code your <code>plural</code> block.
					<ol>
						<li>Drag a new <code>join</code> block out of the palette on the left and into the <code>report</code> block.</li>
						<li>Drag off a copy of the "word" block from the <code>plural</code> hat block, drop it into the first input slot of <code>join</code>, type an "s" in the second slot, and press "OK." Whatever text is typed into the <var>word</var> input slot of <code>plural</code> will be the first input to <code>join</code>.<br/>

						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					Drag your <code>plural of</code> block out of the palette (it'll be at the bottom of the Operators category) into the Scripts area, and test it with different inputs. (For example, if you give it the input "cat," it should report, "cats.") If there are any problems with your block, right-click it, select "edit..." and make sure your code looks like this:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/plural-definition.png" alt="'plural of' in the block editor with 'report (join (word)('s'))' attached below it" title="'plural of' in the block editor with 'report (join (word)('s'))' attached below it" />
				</li>
				<li>Once your <code>plural</code> block is working, try it with <code>random animal</code>, and finally, drag <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/plural-random-animal.png" alt="plural of (random animal)" title="plural of (random animal)" /> into <code>super short story</code>, and make sure it works as expected.</li>

				<div class="todo"><p>It'd be cool if they could try it with something other than random animal, to grok the point of reusable blocks. I realize nothing else needs a plural in the story though, but maybe they could play with it and not put in story? 🤷🏽‍♀️ -- PF 8/20/21</p><p>I agree. Any ideas? --MF, 8/20/21</p></div>
