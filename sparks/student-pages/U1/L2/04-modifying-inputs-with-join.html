		<h2>Modifying Inputs with <code>Join</code></h2>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>There were a lot of fill-in-the-blank prompts in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12GtjpO8cawrWDrR-qTwy4kRTn3M4kF6WW-hW_x7JWtk/edit" title="Activity 2: Refining the Story Google Doc" target="_blank">Refining the Story Google Doc</a>. How are we going to handle that for the HTML version? --MF, 8/11/21<br />Any ideas, anyone? --MF, 8/20/21</p>

				<li>If you haven't used the <code>random animal</code> block, try it in the animal input slot of the <code>Super Short Story</code> block now. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair.png" alt="Talk with Another Pair" title="Talk with Another Pair" /> What is a potential problem with using this block in this story?<div class="todo"><p>The talk thing is awkwardly large and affects the line height funnily, maybe just the short icon? -- PF 8/20/21</p><p>I'm not sure what you mean by a "short icon" but here are some thoughts... --MF, 8/20/21<ol><li>We could redesign the icons; the originals are in /bjc-r/img/icons/icons.ai. Any changes will to the existing PNG will impact CSP. I think that's OK, but it's worth noting.</li><li>We could use class="imageRight" instead of "inline" but I do like using the icon as part of the text...</li></ol></p></div></li>
				<li><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Find the <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join()().png" alt="join" title="join" /> block in the palette and drag it into the Scripts area. Click it, change the inputs, and click it again. What does the <code>join</code> block do?</li>
				<li>
					Drag the <code>random animal</code> block into the first slot of the <code>join</code> block and type an "s" in the second slot. Click it to test that it reports a plural animal, and then drag the entire <code>join</code> expression into the <code>Super Short Story</code> block.<br />
