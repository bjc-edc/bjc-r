		<h2>Adding an Input to Your Block</h2>

			<p>Add support for new variadic slot features. --MF, 2/1/22</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
		  <div class="todo">Why do you prefer the Plain Prototype Labels mode?  We put a lot of thought into the visible plus signs in the default mode, mainly because it makes the process of adding inputs <i>discoverable,</i> whereas it's pretty hard to hover in just the right place to make an invisible plus sign become visible and then click it.  I made Jens add the invisible-plus option only for the sake of making script pics for the manual and other documentation, not as a good way for users to use Snap<i>!.</i> -bh<p>We've talked about this. ;) It's great in Snap!, but it doesn't offer anything except clutter in a static image. --MF, 1/11/23</p></div>
			<ol start="12">
				<li>
					Add an input slot for the word that will be made plural.
					<div class="vocabBig">
						<p>
							<strong>Hat blocks</strong> tell you when a piece of code should be run and what (if any) inputs it takes.<br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/plural-hat.png" alt="'plural of (word)' inside a hat-shaped block" title="'plural of (word)' inside a hat-shaped block" /><br />
							This code will run whenever the <code>plural</code> block is called, and takes one input called <var>word</var>.
						</p>
					</div>
						
					<ol>
						<li>
							Hold your mouse pointer right after the word "of" in the <code>plural</code> <em>hat block</em>, and click the plus sign that appears.<br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/plural-add-input.jpg" alt="'plural of' in the block editor showing the plus sign just after the word 'of' in the hat block" title="'plural of' in the block editor showing the plus sign just after the word 'of' in the hat block" />
						</li>
						<li>Type the word "word," and press "OK."</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					Code your <code>plural</code> block.
					<ol>
						<li>Drag a new <code>join</code> block out of the palette on the left and into the <code>report</code> block.</li>
						<li>Drag off a copy of the "word" block from the <code>plural</code> hat block, drop it into the first input slot of <code>join</code>, type an "s" in the second slot, and press "OK." Whatever text is typed into the <var>word</var> input slot of <code>plural</code> will be the first input to <code>join</code>.<br/>
						<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/plural-drag-word.jpg" alt="'plural of' in the block editor showing a copy of the 'word' variable being dragged off" title="'plural of' in the block editor showing a copy of the 'word' variable being dragged off" />
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					Drag your <code>plural of</code> block out of the palette (it'll be at the bottom of the Operators category) into the Scripts area, and test it with different inputs. (For example, if you give it the input "cat," it should report, "cats.") If there are any problems with your block, right-click it, select "edit..." and make sure your code looks like this:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/plural-definition.png" alt="'plural of' in the block editor with 'report (join (word)('s'))' attached below it" title="'plural of' in the block editor with 'report (join (word)('s'))' attached below it" />
				</li>
				<li>Once your <code>plural</code> block is working, try it with <code>random animal</code>, and finally, drag <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/plural-random-animal.png" alt="plural of (random animal)" title="plural of (random animal)" /> into <code>super short story</code>, and make sure it works as expected.</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work" /></li>
				<div class="todo"><p>It'd be cool if they could try it with something other than random animal, to grok the point of reusable blocks. I realize nothing else needs a plural in the story though, but maybe they could play with it and not put in story? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è -- PF 8/20/21</p><p>I agree. Any ideas? --MF, 8/20/21</p></div>
