					These blocks don't take any inputs, but they are reporters, which means they still report an output.
					<div class="todo">Used to say "since they are reporters" -- I haven't looked at the TG. Do kids know what reporters are? Do teachers? The key word here is "since," which seems to imply we already know that they are. How would <em>novices</em> know? Since this is not a framework-driven course (like CSP), it would be nice if teachers could learn basically from the same curriculum that faces the kids, even though there will (and should) be PD. We want the kids and teachers to learn terms like "reporter," best done from use in context, but might need a bit more context to use them here. --P</div> 
					<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> The <code>super short story</code> block always reports the same thing if given<div class="todo">"if given" -- I'm not an expert on ELs in middle school, but the curriculum should be read by someone who is. My guess is that the syntax (e.g., here with "if given") will be challenging. Some of the vocab will be too, of course, but we want students to learn that (and some will be equally new to all students). Just thinking about extra burdens for EL students. --P </div> the same inputs. What do these blocks report?
