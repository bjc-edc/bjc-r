		<h2>Using a Random Number</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll use a random number generator in the story.</div>

		<p>
			Notice that the input slot for numbers is a different shape. In Snap<em>!</em>, the shape of an input slot tells you what kind of input you can put in that slot. A long rectangle will accept any kind of text (letters, numbers, punctuation, emojis, etc.), but an oval input slot will only accept a number. <br />

		<p>You've seen special <code>random</code> blocks that were designed especially for this project to generate random jobs, actions, and places. Programming languages (including Snap<em>!</em>) usually have a built-in way to generate random numbers.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em> and open your "Super Short Stories" project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
				<li>Locate <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-1-to-10-full-size.png" alt="pick random (1) to (10)" title="pick random (1) to (10)" /> in the palette on the left hand side of the Snap<em>!</em> window, and click it a few times.</li>
				<li>Change the inputs to <code>pick random</code>, and click it a few times to see what happens.</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Describe what the <code>pick random</code> block does.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="ifTime show">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>If you haven't already, try using a decimal number as input to the <code>pick random</code> block. If you haven't already, try using only whole numbers.</li>
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> What happens when you use a whole number as input to <code>pick random</code>? What happens when you use a decimal number?</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="7">
				<li>
					<div class="sidenote">Your <code>super short story</code> block may look different depending on the inputs you've used.</div>
					Drag <code>pick random</code> into the number input slot of <code>super short story</code>, and click the <code>super short story</code> block a few times to check that a random number is used in the story. If it isn't working right, work with another student to sort out the problem.<br />
