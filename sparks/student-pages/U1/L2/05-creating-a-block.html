							<li>
								Right-click (or control-click on a Mac) in an empty spot in the Scripts area and choose "make a block..." <br />
								<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/make-a-block.jpg" alt="make a block option" title="make a block option" />
							</li>
							<li>Choose the color/category for your block (for this block, you might choose light green/Operators; see image at right)</li>
							<li>Type the title for your block (we'll call this block <code>plural of</code>)</li>
							<li>Select the shape for your block (in this case, you want a reporter)</li>
							<li>Click "OK."</li>
						</ol>
						<div class="endnote">Ignore the "for all sprites" vs. "for this sprite only" choice. (It lets you limit where blocks can appear in your project.)</div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<div class="endnote">
					You are creating a reporter, so the block editor opens with a <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/report.png" alt="report" title="report" /> block already attached to the <code>plural </code> hat block. Whatever input you give to the <code>report</code> block will become the value reported by your new block.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/plural-definition-empty.png" alt="'plural of' in the block editor showing with the 'report' block attached below it" title="'plural of' in the block editor showing with the 'report' block attached below it" /><br />
					Your block will only look like that <em>inside the Block Editor</em> that lets you define what the block does. Once you close the Block Editor, your block will look like this: <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/plural-of.png" alt="plural of ()" title="plural of ()" />.

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you made a new block to use to add an "s" to the end of any word.</div>
