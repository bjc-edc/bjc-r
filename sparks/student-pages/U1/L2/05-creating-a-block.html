		<h2>Creating a Block</h2>

		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Abstraction</strong>
			<div class="commentBig"><p>Will they be watching a video on abstraction here? Or does Dan mention it in welcome? It feels so..abstract..here that I wonder what students will take from it. If I wasn't bound to use the term abstraction, I'd probably emphasize the benefit of reuse "When we realize we've developed a useful piece of functionality that we might want to use in other places, we can turn it into its own block." Anyway just musings from your local "abstraction" skeptic, feel free to delete. -- PF 8/20/21</p><p>I added your text at the beginning and am open to a Dan video and/or more discussion about teaching abstraction. :) --MF, 8/20/21</p></div>
			<p>When you realize you've developed a useful piece of script behavior that you might want to use in other places, you can turn it into its own block. This is a form of <em>abstraction</em>.</p>
			<p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is an important idea in computer science. One kind of abstraction is breaking up a large problem into smaller sub-problems.</p>
			<p>For example, instead of putting <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/join-random-animal-s.png" alt="join (random animal) (s)" title="join (random animal) (s)" /> into an input slot of <code>super short story</code>, you can create a <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/plural-of.png" alt="plural of ()" title="plural of ()" /> block and put <code>random animal</code> in its input slot.</p>
			<p>This makes your code easier to read, you can use this new block again in other places, and once the block is working, you don't need to think about <em>how</em> it works each time you use it.  (For example, you might later improve <code>plural</code> to handle words such as "fly" and "box" that don't form their plural just by adding an "s.")</p>

				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em> and open your "Super Short Stories" project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
				<li>
                    Make a new block.
					<ol>
						<li>
							Right-click (or control-click on a Mac) in an empty spot in the Scripts area and choose "make a block..." <br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/make-a-block.jpg" alt="make a block option" title="make a block option" />
						</li>
						<li>Choose the color for your block: light green (Operators).</li>
						<li>Type the title for your block: <code>plural of</code>.</li>
						<li>Select the shape for your block: reporter.</li>
						<li>Click "OK."</li>

					(For now, you should ignore the "for all sprites" vs. "for this sprite only" choice.  Later on, you'll learn when you might want to choose "for this sprite only.")

			You are creating a reporter, so the block editor opens with a <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/report.png" alt="report" title="report" /> block already attached to the <code>plural </code> hat block. Whatever input you give to the <code>report</code> block will become the value reported by your new block.<br />
