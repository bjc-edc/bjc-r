		<h2>Editing the Story Structure</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll edit the structure of the story itself to make it your own story.</div>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, open your "Super Short Stories" project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
				<li>Right-click the <code>super short story</code> block, and select "editâ€¦" from the menu that appears.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			Just as in the <code>plural</code> block, the <code>super short story</code> hat block at the top shows you the structure of the block that will be visible from the outside, including the name of the inputs (<var>job</var>, <var>action</var>, <var>number</var>, and <var>plural animal</var>).<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/super-short-story-block-editor1.png" alt="super short story, job: (job) action: (action) number: (number #) plural animal: (plural animal)" title="super short story, job: (job) action: (action) number: (number #) plural animal: (plural animal)" /><br />
			As before, the code inside the yellow <code>report</code> block controls what is reported when the <code>super short story</code> block is run. These inputs have already been dragged into the code for the block.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/super-short-story-block-editor2.png" alt="report (join ('The happy ') (job) (' sings through the parks and ') (action) (' over ') (number) (' yellow ') (plural animal))" title="report (join ('The happy ') (job) (' sings through the parks and ') (action) (' over ') (number) (' yellow ') (plural animal))" /><br />
		</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Discuss the code inside the <code>report</code> block and how it works to create the output of <code>super short story</code>.</li>
				<li>
					<div class="sidenoteBig">
						For example:
						<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
							<li>Story: Fifteen students are in the park.</li>
							<li>Words to vary: fifteen, students, park</li>
							<li>Variables: number, plural people, place</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					Design your super short story on paper:
					<ol>
						<li>Write out a single-sentence story. You can write your own or use a line from a song, a poem, or something else.</li>
						<li>Choose 3-5 words that you want to vary.</li>
						<li>For each circled word, write the name of a <em>variable</em> (category) to describe the words that could go there.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>

		</div>

		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Variables</strong>
			<div class="todo">Revisit how to do this better for the middle school level. --MF, 7/23/23</div>
			<p>Block inputs (such as <var>job</var>, <var>action</var>, <var>number</var>, and <var>plural animal</var>) are a type of <strong>variable</strong> because the value that they provide to the <code>join</code> block <em>varies</em> based on what is typed into the input slots of the <code>super short story</code> block<!-- but they only can be used in this <em>local</em> context (you can't drag them out of the block editor and expect them to work in other parts of your code)-->.</p>
			<div class="todo">Should this mention that block/script local is different from sprite local? -bh 2/6/22</div>

						<p>You learned how to create a new block in <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L2/05-creating-a-block.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=sparks.html" title="Activity 5: Creating a Block">Activity 5: Creating a Block</a>.</p>
						<p>You learned how to edit an existing block on <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L2/02-editing-a-block.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=sparks.html" title="Activity 2: Editing a Block">Activity 2: Editing a Block</a>.</p>
					</div>
					Decide whether you want to edit the <code>super short story</code> block or create your own new block. If creating your own block, make the new block now.
				</li>
				<li>
					Either way, set up the hat block inside the Block Editor by adding your variables and labels for them. For example, you might want your hat block to look something like this:<br />
					<img  class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/edited-super-short-story-block-editor1.png" alt="super short story, number: (number) people: (people) place: (place)" title="super short story, number: (number) people: (people) place: (place)" /><br />

							</li>
							<li>
								To <strong>add</strong> a label or variable:
								<ol>
									<li>
										Click the plus sign where you want to add something. The plus sign might be invisible until you hold the mouse pointer there.<br />

										To add a label, choose "Title text," or to add a variable, choose "Input name."<br />
										<!--<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/create-input-name.png" alt="" title="" />-->
									</li>
									<li>Type your variable name and click "OK". (You might want a colon in the label as in the examples.) </li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>To <strong>remove</strong> a label or variable: Click the label or variable and choose "Delete."</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					Set up the text and drag in the variables to tell your story using a <code>join</code> block inside the <code>report</code> block. For example, yours might look something like this: <br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/super-short-story-definition.png" alt="" title="" />


				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="ifTime">
			<ol start="8">
				<li>
					<div class="comment">To make the color match, choose the "Lists" as the palette in the block editor.</div>
					Make your own <code>random</code> blocks for your story. For example:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/random-name-definition.png" alt="random name {
	report (item (random) of (list ('Maria') ('Omar') ('Kenji') ('Pablo') ('Kai')))
}" title="random name {

}" />
					<!--<div class="endnote"><strong>Tip:</strong> You can duplicate a block by right-clicking it, selecting the picture of the block in the menu that appears, and dropping the code attached to your mouse pointer in the desired location.<div class="todo">Add a pic. --MF, 7/6/24</div>
					<div class="todo">This used to say "selecting 'duplicate,'" but that's true only if the block is the last one in its script.  I understand that that will be the case in these early functional examples, but imho we shouldn't teach wrong things and then have to unteach them later. If y'all agree you can delete this red box. -bh 2/6/22</div></div>-->
				</li>
				<li>
					Use a line from a song or a poem to inspire a story that uses variables. For example, you might change the song "Mary had a little lamb" to use a random name and a random animal:<br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/song-maker-reporting.png" alt="song marker, name: (random name) animal: (random animal) reporting 'Pablo had a little elephant'" title="song marker, name: (random name) animal: (random animal) reporting 'Pablo had a little elephant'" /><br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/song-maker-definition.png" alt="song maker, name: (name) animal: (animal) {
		report (join (name) (' had a little ') (animal))
	}" title="song maker, name: (name) animal: (animal) {
		report (join (name) (' had a little ') (animal))
	}" />
						</div>
					</div>
				</li>

			</ol>
		</div>


		<div class="learn">In this activity, you changed the labels and variables in the <code>super short story</code> block to match the categories in your own story and edited the structure of the story to make it your own.</div>
