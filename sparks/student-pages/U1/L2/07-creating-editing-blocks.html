		<h2>Editing the Story Structure</h2>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>Split this page into 2 pages ("Editing the Story Structure" and "Saving and Sharing Your Snap<em>!</em> Project"). We need to teach sharing early. --MF, 12/28/21</p>
		</div>
		

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll edit the structure of the story itself to make it your own story.</div>

		<div class="endnote">
			<div class="todo">Move or remove</div>
			<p>The <code>join</code> block joins two strings of text into one (without a space), and you used it to create a plural word. There is also a <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/join-words().png" alt="join words ()" title="join words ()" /> block that joins strings of text <em>with</em> a space between them.<br />
				<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/join-short-story-reporting.png" alt="'join (short) (story)' reporting 'shortstory'" title="'join (short) (story)' reporting 'shortstory'" />
				<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/join-words-short-story-reporting.png" alt="'join words (short) (story)' reporting 'short story'" title="'join words (short) (story)' reporting 'short story'" />
			</p>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em> and open your "Super Short Stories" project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
				<li>Right-click the <code>super short story</code> block, and select "edit…" from the menu that appears.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			Just as in the <code>plural</code> block, the <code>super short story</code> hat block at the top shows you the structure of the block that will be visible from the outside, including the name of the inputs (<var>job</var>, <var>action</var>, <var>number</var>, and <var>plural animal</var>).<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/super-short-story-block-editor.png" alt="Super Short Story, feeling: (feeling) job: (job) action: (action 1) place: (place) action: (action 2) number: (number #) color: (color) plural animal: (animals) food: (food): {report (join words ('The') (feeling) (job) (action 1) ('through') (place) ('and') (action 2) ('over') (number) (color) (animals) ('eating') (food))}" title="Super Short Story, feeling: (feeling) job: (job) action: (action 1) place: (place) action: (action 2) number: (number #) color: (color) plural animal: (animals) food: (food): {report (join words ('The') (feeling) (job) (action 1) ('through') (place) ('and') (action 2) ('over') (number) (color) (animals) ('eating') (food))}" /><br />
			As before, the code inside the yellow <code>report</code> block controls what is reported when the <code>super short story</code> block is run. These inputs have already been dragged into the code for the block.
		</p>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Local Variables</strong>
			<div class="todo">Revisit how to do this better for the middle school level. --MF, 7/23/23</div>
			<p>Block inputs (such as <var>job</var>, <var>action</var>, <var>number</var>, and <var>plural animal</var>, in the <code>super short story</code> example) are called <strong>local variables</strong> because the value they report to <code>join words</code> <em>varies</em> based on what is typed into the input slots of <code>super short story</code>, but they only can be used in this <em>local</em> context (you can't drag them out of the block editor and expect them to work in other parts of your code).</p>
			<div class="todo">Should this mention that block/script local is different from sprite local? -bh 2/6/22</div>
		</div>

		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Discuss the code inside the <code>report</code> block and how it works to create the output of <code>super short story</code>.</li>
				<li><div class="todo">In the limited time I have, I can't make a revision as sweeping as this, but this sequence of instructions, each of which is several details long, with parenthesized contents, will be basically unreadable to many (most?) middle schoolers. They don't need teaspoonfuls, but the entire block of text is likely to be intimidating, especially if they have any reading (or English language) issues. A couple of pictures could help, just to support the text with context. --PG</div>On paper, write out a single-sentence story, select several words to remove, and for each removed word, write the name of a category of words that could replace that word (for example, "feeling" could replace "happy" and "job" could replace "teacher"). Make a list of these categories so you have their names in order.</li>
				<div class="todo">This needs an animation; even a great picture really won't do it as well as an animation would. I need help here. :) --MF, 8/16/21
					<p>Can we just do a short movie? Animated GIFs aren't great usability wise since you can't replay/pause/etc. --PF 8/20/21</p>
					<p>We have a JS script so they can be paused. I'm not against movies in theory, and I can't recall exactly why we've opted against them, but it might have been usability. Videos have to be hosted somewhere, and if the school restricts domains, then the video might not be visible. Uploading elsewhere also recreates development overhead. That's acceptable when a video is really needed (like 1.1.1) but for something quick like this, a little animated GIF is easier to create and embed as an image. Just a few thoughts. We can discuss further if you like. --MF, 8/20/21</p>

				<li>
					Starting at the beginning of the <code>super short story</code> hat block, click each input label (for example, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/feeling-label.jpg" alt="'feeling:' label" title="'feeling:' label" />) and change it to your category name, and then click the variable name for that input (for example, <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/feeling-variable.jpg" alt="'feeling' variable name" title="'feeling' variable name" />) and change that to the same category. Do this for each category in your list.
					<ul>
						<li>If you don't have as many categories as <code>super short story</code> did, click a label or variable and choose "Delete."</li>
						<li>If you have more categories, hold the mouse pointer after the last word in the hat block, and click the plus sign that appears. Then, add text for a label and click "Title text," or add text for a variable and choose "Input name."</li>

		<p>Hello, all. 

My students seem excited about this last activity for Super Short Stories. Using the information in the Student Materials for Activity 3, 

I demonstrated how to take a saying like

The cow jumped over the moon

and turn it into a really short story. See script pick below:



Then, their next activity is to come up with a saying or line from a poem or music that they will change. 

They were really excited about it. A few they were batting around included

To be or not to be. 

I have a dream. 

Kill two birds with one stone. 

I have been to the mountaintop. 

Cheers, 

Bob </p>
