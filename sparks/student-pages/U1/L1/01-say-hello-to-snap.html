			Snap<em>!</em> is a block-based programming environment designed to teach the big ideas of computer science. It can be used to make all sorts of programs—image editing, text processing, games, data analysis, scientific computation, sound editing, robotics, and more.<br />

		<h3>Making Reporters Report</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<div class="vocab">
					<p>A <strong>block</strong> is a piece of code. If you click a block, the computer will run the code.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="todo">Add the open project icon here and on all lab pages going forward. Also update project names to say Sparks instead of BJCMS, and remove any extra blocks added to projects by Snap updates.</div>
				<li>Open this <a class="js-run snap-project" href="/bjc-r/sparks/prog/U1/lab01/say-hello-to-snap.xml" title="Say Hello To Snap - Snap! project">Say Hello To Snap</a> project. It has a single <em>block</em> in the "Scripts" area (the central space of the Snap<em>!</em> window):<br />
			<img class="indent js-runInSnap" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello.png" alt="say hello to () in ('English')" title="say hello to () in ('English')" /></li>
				<li>
					Type a name in the blank slot, and click the block to see what happens. Did you see a bubble pop-up?<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-english-with-inputs-reporting.png" alt="say hello to (Amira) in (English) reporting 'hello, Amira'" title="say hello to (Amira) in (English) reporting 'hello, Amira'" />
				</li>
				<li>Change the name, and click the block again.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Every Snap<em>!</em> program is made up of blocks like <code>say hello</code> that tell the computer what to do. This block says hello to someone in a specified language.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>
					Choose a different language from the dropdown menu that says "English," and click the block again. What changed about the bubble this time?
					<div class="endnote">
						If you'd like a demonstration, click the image below to start/stop a video demonstration.<br />
						<img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-change-language.gif" alt="video showing how to choose a different language in the 'say hello' block by clidking the dropdown menu that says 'English'" title="video showing how to choose a different language in the 'say hello' block by clidking the dropdown menu that says 'English'" />
					</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><!--<strong>: Reporters</strong> and <strong>Inputs</strong>-->
			<ul>
    			<li>
					<strong>Reporters: </strong> There are several kinds of blocks in Snap<em>!</em>. The <code>say hello</code> block is a <strong>reporter</strong> block. (You can tell because it is rounded on the ends.) Reporters do a computation and then "report" the result, such as the reporter block below that is reporting the text "olá Ana."<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-with-inputs-reporting.png" alt="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'olá Ana'" title="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'olá Ana'" /><br />
				</li>
				<li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Many blocks, like <code>say hello</code>, accept <strong>inputs</strong> that customize what they do. Inputs appear as spaces you can edit. The <code>say hello</code> block accepts two inputs: a name and a language. As you've seen, changing the inputs to a reporter can change the output it reports.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3>Blocks Within Blocks</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>Find the <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/fancy.png" alt="fancy ()" title="fancy ()" /> reporter block in the palette on the left. Drag it into the Scripts area somewhere separate from the <code>say hello</code> block.</li>
				<li>Type a name into the <code>fancy</code> block, and click the block to see what it reports. Does it look… Ƒᵃ𝐍𝓬у?</li>
				<li>
					Snap<em>!</em> got its name because you can <em>snap</em> blocks together. Drag the <code>fancy</code> block inside the first input slot of the <code>say hello</code> block, replacing the name from before. Click the combined expression to see the output.
					<div class="endnote">
						<strong>Tip:</strong> When you drag one block inside another block, you can see where it will go. It will go in the input slot marked with the white box.<br />
						<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/drag-and-drop.jpg" alt="An image showing 'fancy(Huan)' being dropped into 'say hello'. There is a white box around the first input of 'say hello' showing where 'fancy(Huan)' will go." title="An image showing 'fancy(Huan)' being dropped into 'say hello'. There is a white box around the first input of 'say hello' showing where 'fancy(Huan)' will go." />
					</div>
					You should see a personalized greeting to a fancy version of the input name in the chosen language.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-fancy-with-inputs-reporting.png" alt="say hello to (fancy('Huan') in ('Cantonese') reporting 'néih hóu ᕼย𝕒Ｎ'" title="say hello to (fancy('Huan') in ('Cantonese') reporting 'néih hóu ᕼย𝕒Ｎ'" />
				</li>
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> Does order matter for blocks inside blocks?
					<ol>
						<li>
							What will be the results of clicking the two expressions below? Will they be the same or different? Don't check in Snap<em>!</em>. Try to figure it out.<br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-fancy.png" alt="say hello to (fancy(Esperanza)) in (Spanish)" title="say hello to (fancy(Esperanza)) in (Spanish)" />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/fancy-say-hello.png" alt="fancy (say hello to (Esperanza) in (Spanish))" title="fancy (say hello to (Esperanza) in (Spanish))" />
						</li>
						<li>After discussing your ideas, check the difference in Snap<em>!</em>. What's going on? Talk to other people until everyone understands what's happening.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned to run a block by clicking it, you saw how changing the inputs to a reporter block can change its output, and you used the output of one reporter as the input to another, making a chain of computation.</div>
