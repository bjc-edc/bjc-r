		<h2>Say Hello to Snap<em>!</em></h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll play greet the user in various languages and with fancy text.</div>
		<div class="todo">I don't know the expected class time per activity. I assume (hope) it is less than one full class period. But this is the kids' fourth activity and the first time they get to <em>be</em> (not pretend to be) a programmer. Activity 3 was account creation and UI. Account creation <em>could</em> be accounted for (ahem) by the teacher in advance, allowing kids (in a suitably designed microworld) to have a real experience in programming immediately on the first day and even save it, and <em>later</em> learn the picky details. The original UCB hoc click-on-Alonzo project, pre-EDC, was a great model. A single palette with a limited set of blocks, and suggestions about what to accomplish next but leaving the student the nice puzzle of figuring out how, which blocks to use. That particular project was not functional-first, but Sparks could invent one. Just saw 1.2.1, where you do exactly what I'd hoped to see first thing. If you <em>start with that the very first day</em>the immediate experience will be an experience doing something impressive with functional programming, leaving details and formalities for later.  (See also the model of BJC's gossip project <a href="https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/2-gossip.html" target="_blank">https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/2-gossip.html</a> which, except for using the sprite to say the result, was entirely functional.)  --PG </div>

		<h3>Loading a Snap project</h3>
		<p>For each lab, we'll provide you with starter projects that you can save to your account.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<div class="todo">Need to edit all other XML files to remove extra blocks. --MF, 9/21/22</div>
				<li>Open this <a class="js-run snap-project" href="/bjc-r/sparks/prog/U1/lab01/say-hello-to-snap.xml" title="Say Hello To Snap - Snap! project">Say Hello To Snap</a> project.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>


		<h3>Saying Hi</h3>
		<p>
			When you open the project, you'll see this single <em>block</em> in the "Scripts" area (the central space of the Snap<em>!</em> window):<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello.png" alt="say hello to () in ('English')" title="say hello to () in ('English')" />
		</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>Type a name in the blank slot, and click the block to see what happens. Did you see a bubble pop-up?</li>
				<li>Change the name, and click the block again.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Every Snap<em>!</em> program is made up of blocks like <code>say hello</code> that tell the computer what to do. This block says hello to someone in a specified language.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="4">
				<li>Choose a different language from the dropdown menu that says "English," and click the block again. What changed about the bubble this time?</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>You just saw how changing the inputs to a block changed its output. Now let's introduce some terminology.</p>
		<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Reporters</strong> and <strong>Inputs</strong>
			<ul>
    			<li>
					There are multiple types of blocks in Snap. This <code>say hello</code> block is a <strong>reporter</strong> block. That means that it does some sort of computation and then "reports" the result. When you click it, the computer runs its code, and you see the reported result in a bubble, like this:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-with-inputs-reporting.png" alt="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'ol√° Ana'" title="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'ol√° Ana'" /><br />
				</li>
				<li>Many blocks, like <code>say hello</code>, accept <strong>inputs</strong> that customize what they do, and those inputs show up as spaces you can edit. The <code>say hello</code> block accepts two inputs, a name and a language. You can change the inputs to change the output (in this case, the reported greeting).</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3>Blocks Within Blocks</h3>
		<p>There are lots of blocks in Snap<em>!</em>, and you can even make your own. For this first project, most of the blocks are hidden, but you should see a <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/fancy.png" alt="fancy ()" title="fancy ()" /> block in the palette on the left.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>Drag the <code>fancy</code> block
		somewhere separate from the <code>say hello</code> block in the Scripts area.</li>
				<li>Type a name into the <code>fancy</code> block, and click it to see the output. Does it look‚Ä¶ ∆ë·µÉùêçùì¨—É?</li>
				<li>Snap<em>!</em> is called Snap<em>!</em> because you can <em>snap</em> blocks together. Drag that <code>fancy</code> block into the first input slot of the <code>say hello</code> block, replacing the name from before, and click the block to see the output.</li>
				<div class="endnote">
					<strong>Tip:</strong> You can tell where the block you are dragging will drop when you let it go because the input slot where it will land will be marked with a white box. <a href="#hint-drop" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a picture of how to know where a block you are dragging will drop">Click for a picture.</a>
					<div id="hint-drop" class="collapse"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/drag-and-drop.jpg" alt="image of Snap! 'Scripts' area with the 'fancy('Huan')' block being dropped into 'say hello to ('Huan') in ('Cantonese')'. There is a white box around the 'Huan' in the 'say hello to ('Huan') in ('Cantonese')' block showing where 'fancy('Huan')' will land." title="image of Snap! 'Scripts' area with the 'fancy('Huan')' block being dropped into 'say hello to ('Huan') in ('Cantonese')'. There is a white box around the 'Huan' in the 'say hello to ('Huan') in ('Cantonese')' block showing where 'fancy('Huan')' will land." /></div>
				</div>

				<li>
					You should see a personalized greeting to a fancy version of the input name in the chosen language.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-fancy-with-inputs-reporting.png" alt="say hello to (fancy('Huan') in ('Cantonese') reporting 'n√©ih h√≥u ·ïº‡∏¢ùïíÔºÆ'" title="say hello to (fancy('Huan') in ('Cantonese') reporting 'n√©ih h√≥u ·ïº‡∏¢ùïíÔºÆ'" />
				</li>
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
					Without checking first, discuss what you think will be the difference between running these two blocks. After discussing your ideas, check in Snap<em>!</em>.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-fancy.png" alt="say hello to (fancy(Esperanza)) in (Spanish)" title="say hello to (fancy(Esperanza)) in (Spanish)" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/fancy-say-hello.png" alt="fancy (say hello to (Esperanza) in (Spanish))" title="fancy (say hello to (Esperanza) in (Spanish))" />
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>That's the power of reporter blocks! You can use the output of one block as the input to another block, making a chain of computation.</p>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned to run a block by clicking it, you changed the inputs to the <code>say hello</code> and <code>fancy</code> blocks and observed their outputs, and you dragged the <code>fancy</code> block into the <code>say hello</code> block so that the output of one block could be used as the input of the other.</div>
