					Discuss the growth mindset.
					<ul>
					    <li>When is a time when you used the growth mindset? How did it help you?</li>
						<li>When is a time you would have benefited from thinking with a growth mindset? what could you do differently in a situation like that next time?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Part of cultivating a growth mindset is creating a classroom culture that supports learning. Work with your class to develop a list of classroom norms by responding to these questions:
					<ul>
						<li>What makes it easier for you to learn?</li>
						<li>What gets in the way of your learning?</li>
						<li>What classroom norms could we create to facilitate your learning?<div class="comment">The questions "what makes it easier to learn" and "what gets in the way" above might be worth the teacher knowing, if the teacher is a sensitive person. The questions about prior experience and goals are certainly worth the teacher knowing. But, to the question about norms middle school students will parrot only what they think the teacher wants to hear. It is unlikely to be perceived as a sincere question unless they already know and trust and are extremely comfortable with the teacher. --PG</div></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					All levels of computing experience are welcome in this class. To help your teacher understand your background, share your responses to these questions:
					<ul>
						<li>What is your computing experience?</li>
						<li>What do you want out of this course?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned that this new course is currently under development and about using the growth mindset for constructive learning and problem solving.</div>
		<div class="todo">I think that developing/acquiring a growth mindset is enormously important and school often doesn't foster it. My experience in schools, though, is that <em>discussing</em> growth mindset becomes ritualized propaganda. Many (most?) teachers enter the profession with a fixed mindset——this student has a mathematical mind, that one is a born artist, I was never good at math. If you don't <em>have</em> a growth mindset yourself, you can't help students develop one because you are trying to teach something you don't believe. If you do believe, "teaching" it is still proselytizing to kids who do or don't have the same religion. Kids are so used to this in school that they hear it just as "more school blather." If you want kids to <em>believe</em> that they can learn, they need proof, not propaganda. So, especially on the first day, <em>prove</em> that they can grow by letting them <em>learn</em> something they didn't think they could do. <li>A superhighenergy, dynamic, charismatic college professor working in special sessions with kids <em>could</em> start anywhere and still have kids expectantly waiting for the heady stuff. But in the average school, while kids may have high hopes, they don't generally have high expectations. Discussions of how to behave, especially with middle-schoolers, won't set a tone of beauty and joy.</li>To pull kids in, to give them an immediate experience of beauty and joy, start with Lab 2, and come back later for whatever is really needed in Lab 1. --PG </div>
