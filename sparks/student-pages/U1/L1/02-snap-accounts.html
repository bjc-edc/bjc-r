		<h2>Snap<em>!</em> Accounts</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll use a Snap<em>!</em> account to save your work and customize your programming environment.</div>

		<h3>Creating a Snap<em>!</em> Account</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Go to <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/run" title="https://snap.berkeley.edu/run" target="_blank">https://snap.berkeley.edu/run</a>.</li>
				<li>
					<div class="comment">Image should be redone at a higher resolution. --MF, 8/12/21</div>
					Click the Cloud menu (it looks like a cloud: <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" alt="cloud menu button" title="cloud menu button" />), select "Signup...", and follow the instructions.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/button-cloud-with-context.png" alt="cloud icon" title="cloud icon"/>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>You should be logged in whenever you are in Snap<em>!</em>, and you should log out whenever you are done. You can use the Cloud menu to log in, log out, check if you are logged in, and change your password.</p>

		<h3>Saving Your Project</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work" />
				<li>Make sure you are logged in to Snap<em>!</em> by checking that your name appears in the Snap<em>!</em> Cloud menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png" alt="cloud menu button" title="cloud menu button" />), and logging in if necessary.</li>
				<li> Save this project to your Snap<em>!</em> account by choosing "Save" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (it looks like a piece of paper with a corner folded: <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File menu button" title="File menu button"/>).</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>Be sure to save your projects after an important change and, if you are using a shared computer, whenever you're done for the day.</p>

		<h3>Customizing Snap<em>!</em></h3>
		<p>When you are logged in, you can customize the Snap<em>!</em> environment based using the Snap<em>!</em> Settings menu (it looks like a gear: <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/settings.png" alt="Settings menu button" title="Settings menu button" />). Next time you log in, you'll have your customizations set up already.</p>

		<h4><strong>Language</strong></h4>
		<p>If you'd prefer to work in a language other than English, you can change the language used in the Snap<em>!</em> interface.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="5">
				<li>Open the Settings menu, select "Language" (at the top of the menu), and select a different language.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>A few blocks may stay in English, but most of the interface will be translated.</p>

		<h4><strong>Block Size</strong></h4>
		<p>You can adjust the size of the blocks in Snap<em>!</em> in case you need to see better or you want more room to work.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="6">
				<li>Open the Settings menu, select "Zoom blocks" (near the top of the menu), choose a new setting (with the slider, with the dropdown menu, or by typing a value in), and click "OK."</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h4><strong>Light Mode vs. Dark Mode</strong></h4>
		<p>Snap<em>!</em> starts off in a "dark mode" by default, which means the backgrounds are a dark gray. Some people prefer dark modes, especially people who work late at night. You can change the background back and forth between dark and light by using the "flat design" setting.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="7">
				<li>Open the Settings menu, and select "Flat design" (about halfway down the menu).</li>
			</ol>
			<div class="endnote">
				<a href="#hint-drop" data-toggle="collapse" title="Why is it called &ldquo;flat&rdquo; mode and not &ldquo;light&rdquo; mode?">Why is it called &ldquo;flat&rdquo; mode and not &ldquo;light&rdquo; mode?</a>
				<div id="hint-drop" class="collapse">Although the background color is the most visible difference, the block shapes are also different.  The normal blocks are shaded to give a three-dimensional look; the flat blocks don't have that shading.  There's no reason there couldn't be dark flat mode or light shaded mode, but the fewer modes, the less likely it is for things not to work together.</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned how to log out, check if you are logged in, change your password, and configure the language, block size, and "look" of Snap<em>!</em>.</div>
