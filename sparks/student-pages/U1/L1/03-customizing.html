		<h2>Customizing Snap<em>!</em></h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll customize your programming environment.</div>
		<p>You can customize the Snap<em>!</em> environment based using the Snap<em>!</em> Settings menu (it looks like a gear: <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/settings.png" alt="Settings menu button" title="Settings menu button" />). If you have a Snap<em>!</em> account, the next time you log in, you'll have your customizations set up already.</p>

		<h3><strong>Language</strong></h3>
		<p>If you'd prefer to work in a language other than English, you can change the language used in the Snap<em>!</em> interface.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="1">
				<li>Open the Settings menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/settings.png" alt="Settings menu button" title="Settings menu button" />), select "Language" (at the top of the menu), and select a different language.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>A few blocks may stay in English, but most of the interface will be translated.</p>

		<h3><strong>Block Size</strong></h3>
		<p>You can adjust the size of the blocks in Snap<em>!</em> in case you need to see better or you want more room to work.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>Open the Settings menu, select "Zoom blocks" (near the top of the menu), choose a new setting (with the slider, with the dropdown menu, or by typing a value in), and click "OK."</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3><strong>Bright vs. Dark Background</strong></h3>
		<p>Snap<em>!</em> starts off in a dark mode by default, which means the backgrounds are a dark gray. Some people prefer dark backgrounds, especially people who work late at night. You can change the background using "Looks..."</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>Open the Settings menu, and select "Looks..." (near the top of the menu). There are (at least) two ways to change the look. "Bright theme" makes the background white. "Flat design" removes the slight three-dimensional shading from the blocks.<br />
                (If you see a seasonal option, those appear on blocks in the yellow "Control" palette.)</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned how change the "look" of Snap<em>!</em>.</div>
