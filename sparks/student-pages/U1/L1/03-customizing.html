		<h2>Customizing Snap<em>!</em></h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll customize your programming environment.</div>
		<p>You can customize the Snap<em>!</em> environment based using the Snap<em>!</em> Settings menu (it looks like a gear: <img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/settings.png" alt="Settings menu button" title="Settings menu button" />). If you have a Snap<em>!</em> account, the next time you log in, you'll have your customizations set up already.</p>

		<h3><strong>Language</strong></h3>
		<p>If you'd prefer to work in a language other than English, you can change the language used in the Snap<em>!</em> interface.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="1">
				<li>Open the Settings menu (<img src="/bjc-r/img/sys/settings.png" alt="Settings menu button" title="Settings menu button" />), select "Language" (at the top of the menu), and select a different language.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>A few blocks may stay in English, but most of the interface will be translated.</p>

		<h3><strong>Block Size</strong></h3>
		<p>You can adjust the size of the blocks in Snap<em>!</em> in case you need to see better or you want more room to work.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>Open the Settings menu, select "Zoom blocks" (near the top of the menu), choose a new setting (with the slider, with the dropdown menu, or by typing a value in), and click "OK."</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<h3><strong>Light Mode vs. Dark Mode</strong></h3>
		<p>Snap<em>!</em> starts off in a "dark mode" by default, which means the backgrounds are a dark gray. Some people prefer dark modes, especially people who work late at night. You can change the background back and forth between dark and light by using the "flat design" setting.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="3">
				<li>Open the Settings menu, and select "Flat design" (about halfway down the menu).</li>
			</ol>
			<div class="endnote">
				<a href="#hint-drop" data-toggle="collapse" title="Why is it called &ldquo;flat&rdquo; mode and not &ldquo;light&rdquo; mode?">Why is it called &ldquo;flat&rdquo; mode and not &ldquo;light&rdquo; mode?</a>
				<div id="hint-drop" class="collapse">Although the background color is the most visible difference, the block shapes are also different.  The normal blocks are shaded to give a three-dimensional look; the flat blocks don't have that shading.  There's no reason there couldn't be dark flat mode or light shaded mode, but fewer modes keep things simpler.</div>
			</div>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned how change the "look" of Snap<em>!</em>.</div>
