The gray ring tells you that the <code>map</code> function is expecting a function (not the output of a function) as input.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab04/gray-ring.png" alt="gray ring" title="gray ring" />
				</p>
				<p><code>Map</code> takes a function as input so it can apply that function to each item in the list. The empty input slot in the function (in this case, the pixel) is where each item from the list (in this case, the list of pixels) goes every time the function is applied.</p>
