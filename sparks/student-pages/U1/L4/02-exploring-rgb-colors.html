		<h2>Exploring RGB Colors</h2>
		<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll explore how RGB color values create colors.</div>

				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em> and open your "Pixel Display" project by choosing "Open" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu.</li>
				<li>Find the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab04/rgb-pixel.png" alt="RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255)" title="RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255)" /> block in the palette, drag it into the scripting area, and click the block to run it. The <code>RGB pixel</code> block takes three numbers as input and reports a <em>list</em> with the those three color values.</li>
				<div class="vocabFullWidth">
					<p>A <strong>list</strong> is an ordered sequence of items.<div class="todo">PLEASE don't interrupt experiments with huge vocabulary lessons. The language "reports a list" is sufficient context to make clear what a list is. And anyway, kids already know. They've seen the lists you show here and before that they've seen shopping lists. The fact that a list, in this context  is "an ordered sequence" (unlike a shopping list) is true and important but can be taken for granted. Kids want to experiment and the last two items in this activity are potentially fun and interesting. Making vocabulary a priority just guarantees that it will become the focus of the course, will be tested, and will kill any semblance of B and J that is left. --PG </div></p>

							You've seen a list before when you selected random items from lists in the Super Short Story project:<br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/random-job-block-editor.png" alt="random job: {report (item (random) of (list (artist) (computer programmer) (cashier) (musician) (landscaper) (nurse) (plumber)))}" title="random job: {report (item (random) of (list (artist) (computer programmer) (cashier) (musician) (landscaper) (nurse) (plumber)))}" /><br />
							The output of <code>random job</code> was a random item from the list of jobs.

						<p>The output of <code>RGB pixel</code> is a list of three values: the amount of red, green, and blue for one pixel.</p>

					The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab04/draw-pixel.png" alt="draw pixel 'list input slot'" title="draw pixel 'list input slot'" /> block takes a list of RGB values as input and draws a pixel with those values on the stage. Find the <code>draw pixel</code> block in the palette, drag it into the scripting area, snap the <code>RGB pixel</code> block into the open input slot, and run the script to draw a pixel with those color values.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab04/draw-pixel-rgb-85-170-255.png" alt="draw pixel (RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255))" title="draw pixel (RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255))" />
				</li>
				<li>
					RGB pixels have integer color values from 0 to 255. Experiment with the input values to the <code>RGB pixel</code> block inside <code>draw pixel</code>, and see how it changes the pixel drawn on the stage.<br />

				</li>
				<li>
					The <code>paint color from pixel</code> block takes two inputs, a list of RGB color values and a resolution, and it paints a grid of pixels on the stage with those color values at that resolution. Find the <code>paint color from pixel</code> block, and build and run this script.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab04/paint-color-from-pixel-rgb-pixel.png" alt="paint color from pixel (RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255))" title="paint color from pixel (RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255))" /><br />
				</li>
				<li>Keep increasing the resolution and clicking the script. At what resolution do you start seeing a single color?</li>
				<li>
					<div class="sidenote">Reminder: RGB pixels have integer color values from 0 to 255.</div>
					Experiment with the input values to the <code>RGB pixel</code> block inside <code>paint color from pixel</code>.

					<p>These aren't really pixels but are instead <em>models</em> of pixels made to show how pixels blend to make colors. They are only a third as bright as real pixels because the real pixels that display these model pixels on your screen each include only a third of their total possible brightness. (Real white pixels have 100% red, 100% green, 100% blue not just 100% red but no green or blue near a pixel with 100% green but no red or blue and a pixel with 100% blue but no red or green.)</p>

					<p>You might be familiar with <em>subtractive</em> color mixing where the primary colors are red, yellow, and blue and you can get secondary colors by mixing red and yellow to make orange, yellow and blue to make green, and red and blue to make purple. Mixing paints is subtractive color mixing, but mixing light (like the images on a screen) is <em>additive</em> color mixing. In additive color mixing, the primaries are red, green, and blue, and the secondary colors that you get by mixing equal parts of the primaries are yellow, cyan, and magenta.</p>
					<p>Additive color mixing (like on a screen) is called <em>additive</em> because you start with no light and <em>add</em> light to get colors. Subtractive color mixing (like with paint) is called <em>subtractive</em> because you start with white light (which includes all the colors), and the paint <em>absorbs</em> (takes away) all the colors except the one reflected back to your eye.  (For example, when white light hits red paint, all colors are absorbed except red.)</p>
