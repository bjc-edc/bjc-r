			<ul>
    			<li>
					<strong>Reporters: </strong> There are several kinds of blocks in Snap<em>!</em>. The <code>say hello</code> block is a <strong>reporter</strong> block. (You can tell because it is rounded on the ends.) Reporters do a computation and then "report" the result, such as the reporter block below that is reporting the text "olá Ana."<br>

				</li>
				<li>
<strong>Inputs:</strong> Many blocks, like <code>say hello</code>, accept <strong>inputs</strong> that customize what they do. Inputs appear as spaces you can edit. The <code>say hello</code> block accepts two inputs: a name and a language. As you've seen, changing the inputs to a reporter can change the output it reports.</li>

			<div class="todo">
<p>Will they be watching a video on abstraction here? Or does Dan mention it in welcome? It feels so..abstract..here that I wonder what students will take from it. If I wasn't bound to use the term abstraction, I'd probably emphasize the benefit of reuse "When we realize we've developed a useful piece of functionality that we might want to use in other places, we can turn it into its own block." Anyway just musings from your local "abstraction" skeptic, feel free to delete. -- PF 8/20/21</p>
<p>I added your text at the beginning and am open to a Dan video and/or more discussion about teaching abstraction. :) --MF, 8/20/21</p>
</div>
			<p>When you've developed a useful piece of code that you want to use in other places, you can turn it into its own block. This is a form of <em>abstraction</em>. <strong>Abstraction</strong> is an important idea in computer science. One kind of abstraction is breaking up a large problem into smaller sub-problems.</p>
			<div class="endnote">For example, instead of putting <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/join-random-animal-s.png" alt="join (random animal) (s)" title="join (random animal) (s)"> into an input slot of <code>super short story</code>, you can create a <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/plural-of.png" alt="plural of ()" title="plural of ()"> block and put <code>random animal</code> in its input slot.</div>
			<p>This makes your code easier to read, you can use the new block again in other places, and once the block is working, you don't need to think about <em>how</em> it works each time you use it.</p>
			<!--<div class="endnote">For example, you might later improve <code>plural</code> to handle words such as "fly" and "box" that don't form their plural just by adding an "s.")</div>-->

			<div class="todo">Revisit how to do this better for the middle school level. --MF, 7/23/23</div>
			<p>Block inputs (such as <var>job</var>, <var>action</var>, <var>number</var>, and <var>plural animal</var>) are a type of <strong>variable</strong> because the value that they provide to the <code>join</code> block <em>varies</em> based on what is typed into the input slots of the <code>super short story</code> block<!-- but they only can be used in this <em>local</em> context (you can't drag them out of the block editor and expect them to work in other parts of your code)-->.</p>
