The <code>say hello</code> block is a <strong>reporter</strong> block. Reporters do a computation and then "report" the result. For example, the result of running the reporter block below is the text "olá Ana" shown in the bubble beside it.<br>					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-with-inputs-reporting.png" alt="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'olá Ana'" title="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'olá Ana'"><br>				</li>				<li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Many blocks, like <code>say hello</code>, accept <strong>inputs</strong> that customize what they do. Inputs appear as spaces you can edit. The <code>say hello</code> block accepts two inputs: a name and a language. As you've seen, changing the inputs to a reporter can change the output it reports.</li>			</ul>		</div><div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L1/01-say-hello-to-snap.html">1.1.1</a>					<p>A <strong>block</strong> is a piece of code.

(For example, you might later improve <code>plural</code> to handle words such as "fly" and "box" that don't form their plural just by adding an "s.")</p>		</div><div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L2/02-refining-the-story.html">1.2.2</a>						<p>							<strong>Hat blocks</strong> tell you when a piece of code should be run and what (if any) inputs it takes.<br>							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab02/plural-hat.png" alt="'plural of (word)' inside a hat-shaped block" title="'plural of (word)' inside a hat-shaped block"><br>							This code will run whenever the <code>plural</code> block is called, and takes one input called <var>word</var>.						</p>					</div><div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L2/03-creating-editing-blocks.html">1.2.3</a><strong>: Local Variables</strong>		  <p>Block inputs (such as <var>feeling</var>,  <var>job</var>, <var>action 1</var>, <var>place</var>, <var>action 2</var>, etc., in the <code>super short story</code> example) are called <strong>local variables</strong> because the value they report to <code>join words</code> <em>varies</em> based on what is typed into the input slots of <code>super short story</code>, but they only can be used in this <em>local</em> context (you can't drag them out of the block editor and expect them to work in other parts of your code).</p>		  <div class="todo">Should this mention that block/script local is different from sprite local? -bh 2/6/22</div>		</div><h3>Lab 4: Image Manipulation</h3><div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L4/01-picture-of-a-pixel.html">1.4.1</a>				<p>A <strong>pixel</strong> (short for <strong>pic</strong>ture <strong>el</strong>ement) is the smallest programmable unit of color on a screen.</p>			</div><div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L4/01-picture-of-a-pixel.html">1.4.1</a>				<p><strong>Resolution</strong> is the level of detail in an image.</p>			</div><div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L4/02-exploring-rgb-colors.html">1.4.2</a>					<p>A <strong>list</strong> is an ordered sequence of items.</p><div class="todo">PLEASE don't interrupt experiments with huge vocabulary lessons.
