		<h2>Programming a Caesar Cipher</h2>
		<div class="todo"><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=jadga&ProjectName=Caesarscheibe&editMode&noRun">Jadga's project</a> "In workshops, I often use this dial thing to let kids manually decipher a text. it takes a while though to do it by hand ;)"</div>

		<div class="learn">
			In this activity, you will write a program to encode and decode messages using a Caesar cipher (shift cipher).<br />

        <h3>Exploring Unicode</h3>
		<p>To shift the letters in a message, you need a way to add the shift value to each letter. Computers store characters (letters, digits, symbols, etc.) as numbers called <a href="https://home.unicode.org/" title="Unicode" target="_blank">Unicode</a>. So, you can change the characters of a message into Unicode, add (to make the shift), and then change the Unicode back into letters.</p>
		<div class="comment">Hm, I'm not sure how much to nitpick this, since I know we're trying to simplify. When a computer program uses a UTF encoding, then it stores characters in binary according to the Unicode standard which defines code-points for thousands of characters. "Unicode number" is ambiguous as a pharase (since it could describe a number which can be typed in Unicode), "Unicode code-point" is the correct phrase. It might be interesting to note that humans are the ones that decide those code-points, so you can't just guess it - a computer or language has to store the entire table of Unicode code-points for all 150K characters. There are also encodings besides UTF/Unicode, some of which are relatively popular in other countries (like Japan), since Unicode emerged from English-based ASCII. -PF 10/1/21</div>
		<p>
			This table shows the Unicode for some familiar characters:<br />
            <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/img_CaesarCipher/Mary_CharacterTable.jpeg" height="330px" alt="Unicode Table"/>
              <div class="comment">Another nitpick, which you can glaze over as needed for MS. Unicode code-points are technically written with U+ a hexadecimal number. So technically the codepoint is U+0041 for "A", and what you see in this table is the decimal numeral for that codepoint. And apparently snap returns the decimal numeral, for convenience. Yeah, probably should glaze over this point for MS, now that I write it out. -PF 10/1/21</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>unicode of</code> block reports the Unicode number that is used for a particular character:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab05/unicode-B-reporting.png" alt="unicode of (B) reporting '66'" title="unicode of (B) reporting '66'" />
		</p>
		<p>
            The <code>unicode as letter</code> block reports the character that a given Unicode number represents:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab05/unicode-66-reporting.png" alt="unicode (66) as letter reporting 'B'" title="unicode (66) as letter reporting 'B'" />
        </p>
		<p>
			You can right-click (or control-click on a Mac) either block and select "help..." from the down-down menu to see more details of how the block works.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab05/unicode-of-dropdown.png" alt="unicode of block with dropdown menu open showing 'help...' menu-item selected" title="unicode of block with dropdown menu open showing 'help...' menu-item selected" />

		</p>
		<div class="todo">We should go back and generate help-text for each of the custom blocks we created. When we do, we could add additional info to this reminder about how it works for other blocks and/or add additional notes to use the block help elsewhere in the curriculum. --MF, 10/5/21</div>

        <div class="forYouToDo" id="second">
            <ol>
				<li>Open this <a class="js-run snap-project" href="/bjc-r/sparks/prog/U1/lab05/caesar-cipher.xml" title="Caesar Cipher - Snap! project" target="_blank">Caesar Cipher</a> project, and save it to your account.</li>
                <li>Experiment with the <code>unicode of</code> and <code>unicode as letter</code> blocks. Write down the Unicode numbers for one word, give them to another student, and translate someone else's Unicode back into a word.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>


		<h3>Working with Lists</h3>
		<p>
			If you type more than one character into the input slot of <code>unicode of</code>, it will report a list of the Unicode numbers of those letters:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab05/unicode-BJC-reporting.png" alt="unicode of (BJC) reporting the list {66, 74, 67}" title="unicode of (BJC) reporting the list {66, 74, 67}" />
		</p>
		<p>
			You can shift all the letters at once by using that list as the input to the <img class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/plus.png" alt="() + ()" title="() + ()" /> block:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab05/unicode-BJC+3-reporting.png" alt="(unicode of (BJC)) + (3) reporting the list {69, 77, 70}" title="(unicode of (BJC)) + (3) reporting the list {69, 77, 70}" />
		</p>
		<p>
			The <code>unicode as letter</code> block can also accept a list as input. It will report a list of the characters for those Unicode numbers:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab05/unicode(unicode-BJC+3)as-letter-reporting.png" alt="unicode (unicode of (BJC) + 3) as letter reporting the list {E, M, F}" title="unicode (unicode of (BJC) + 3) as letter reporting the list {E, M, F}" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, the <code>join</code> block can accept a list as input too. It will join all the letters from a list into a single string of text:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab05/join-unicode(unicode-BJC+3)as-letter-reporting.png" alt="join( unicode (unicode of (BJC) + 3) as letter) reporting 'EMF'" title="join( unicode (unicode of (BJC) + 3) as letter) reporting 'EMF'" />
		</p>
                <div class="commentBig">I'm definitely curious whether MS students can follow the deep nesting here. I showed to my partner (a software engineer) and he was able to grok it, but said he'd prefer a piping flow versus a nesting flow. I don't think we used the pipe block yet, but it'd be very interesting pedagogically to see if that'd be a better learning experience for flows like this one. -PF 10/1/21<p>I like this idea, and we had taught it in CSP, but I believe Brian advocated for removing it entirely, which it appears we did. We should discuss why before deciding whether to add it to middle school. --MF, 10/12/21</p></div>
