		<h3>Storing Numbers in Bits</h3>
        <div class="vocabBig">: <strong>Bit</strong>
            <p>The word "bit" is an abbreviation for <em><strong>bi</strong>nary digi<strong>t</strong>.</em></p>
        </div>
		<p>In a binary numeral, the digit in each place value is called a <em>bit</em>. So 1010 is a 4-bit number. Because there are fewer digits in binary (only 0 and 1) than in decimal (0-9), a number that's only a few digits long in decimal may be many bits long in binary.</p>

				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap! and open your "Numbers Bits Electricity" project.</li>
				<li>
					Drag the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab05/bin-of-dec.png" alt=" binary of decimal ()" title="binary of decimal ()" /> block into the main area. You can type decimal numbers directly into that block or you can even drag your previous calculations into the block. <br />

					<ol>
						<li>Can you find a number that's the same in decimal and binary?</li>
						<li>Can you get a result that's all 1s? Hint: Start by trying to get just one 1, then two 1s, etc.</li>
						<li>Can you get a result that's 11110000? You may need a calculator and/or a teacher to figure this one out.</li>

		<h3>Storing Bits as Electricity</h3>
		<p>You might be wondering what the ones and zeros look like inside the computer, but actually, computers don't really store the digits 0 and 1. Computers store data using electricity. Generally, a 1 is stored as a positively charged electric signal and a 0 is stored as no charge at all.</p>
		<p>
			For example, the memory of your computer most likely stores bits by storing charge in a capacitor. Here are some capacitors of varying sizes:<br />

			<img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab05/capacitors.png" alt="three images of different-sized capacitors, which look like little cylinders with text and numbers on them and two wires coming out of one base" title="three images of different-sized capacitors, which look like little cylinders with text and numbers on them and two wires coming out of one base" />
		</p>
		<p>The bits inside your computer are teeny tiny&mdash;around 20 nanometers, and a nanometer is so small that a billion of them (1,000,000,000) are in one meter! That's why computers are able to store so much information.</p>
		<p>
			For the binary number 1010, we could imagine the computer storing it like this:<br />
			<img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab05/capacitors-1010.png" alt="four drawings of capacitors with charges: +, none, +, none" title="four pictures of drawings with charges: +, none, +, none" />
		</p>
		<p>The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab05/elec-of-bin.png" alt="electric of binary ()" title="electric of binary ()" /> block will help you visualize how the computer stores any binary number.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="6">
				<li>
					Drag the <code>electric of binary</code> block into the Scripts area, and experiment with it. You can type binary numbers directly into that block, or you can drag in a <code>decimal to binary</code> block. Try both ways.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab05/elec-of-bin-reporting.png" alt="electric of binary (1010) reporting four drawings of capacitors with charges: +, none, +, none" title="electric of binary (1010) reporting four drawings of capacitors with charges: +, none, +, none" />

				</li>
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
					<ol>
						<li>What numbers result in no capacitors charged at all?</li>
						<li>What numbers make all the capacitors light up with charge?</li>
						<li>What's a decimal numeral that charges every capacitor but one?</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>

		<div class="learn">In this activity, you explored binary representation further and learned that binary data is stored as electric signals by capacitors in a computer.</div>
