		<h2><code>Combine</code>-ing Data</h2>

            <p>In this activity, you'll create blocks to make Snap<em>!</em> do math with your data for you.</p>
        </div>
		<p>
			Snap<em>!</em> has another built-in block that is useful for data analysis: The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/combine.png" alt="combine 'list input slot' using 'predicate input slot'" title="combine 'list input slot' using 'predicate input slot'" /> block combines the elements of a list using an operation. For example, this expression adds all the values in the list 0, 1, 2.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/combine-simple-example.png" alt="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3" title="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3" />
		</p>
		<div class="takeNote">
            <p>Notice that the function used to <em>combine</em> the list items needs has <em>two</em> blank input slots. The <code>keep</code> block only needs one blank in its input function, but <code>combine</code> requires two slots since it combines an item with the item after it.</p>
        </div>

		<div class="endnote">
			<p>Unlike <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> which also take functions as inputs, the <code>combine</code> function is used with only a few input functions.</p>

			<div id="hint-which-functions" class="collapse">

					<code>Combine</code> is mostly used only with these built-in functions:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/plus.png" alt="+" title="+" /> <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/times.png" alt="&times;" title="&times;" /><br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/and-block.png" alt="and" title="and" /> <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/or-block.png" alt="or" title="or" /><br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/join.png" alt="join" title="join" /> <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/join-words.png" alt="join words" title="join words" /><br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/max-number-slots.png" alt="() max ()" title="() max ()" /> <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/min-number-slots.png" alt="() min ()" title="() min ()" />
				</p>
				<p><a href="#hint-why-only-these" data-toggle="collapse" title="Why can 'combine' only use these functions?">Why only these functions?</a></p>
				<div id="hint-why-only-these" class="collapse">
					<p><code>Combine</code> takes a <em>list</em> of values as input. It combines the first two values using the input function, then combines that result with the third value using the function, then combines that result with the next value, and so on.</p>
					<p>So, it can't matter to the input function in what order you group the items. Notice that (4&thinsp;+&thinsp;1)&thinsp;+&thinsp;3 is the same as 4&thinsp;+&thinsp;(1&thinsp;+&thinsp;3), but (4&thinsp;−&thinsp;1)&thinsp;−&thinsp;3 is different from 4&thinsp;−&thinsp;(1&thinsp;−&thinsp;3). With <code>combine</code>, we don't use functions where order matters (such as subtraction or division).</p>

		<h3>Finding a Maximum or Minimum Value</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>Open your "Data Dos" project if it isn't open already.</li>
				<li>
					Locate the <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/max-number-slots.png" alt="() max ()" title="() max ()" /> and <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/min-number-slots.png" alt="() min ()" title="() min ()" /> blocks hidden behind the <code>+</code>, <code>–</code>, <code>&times;</code>, and <code>/</code> functions.
					<div class="endnote">
						To access them, right click the block, select "relabel...", and choose the function you want. <a href="#hint-relabel" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for a demonstration of using the 'relabel' menu option to access hidden functions.">Click for a demonstration.</a>
						<div id="hint-relabel" class="collapse"><img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/relabel-demo-max-min.gif" alt="animation showing the + block, its right-click menu open with 'relabel...' selected, then another menu open showing additional operator reporter blocks with MAX selected, and finally just the MAX block in place of the + block.

The animation cycles through selecting a variety of different  operator reporter blocks." /></div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
                    Use these blocks with <code>combine</code> to complete the block definitions for  <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/maximum-of-list.png" alt="maximum of 'list input slot'" title="maximum of 'list input slot'" /> and <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/minimum-of-list.png" alt="minimum of 'list input slot'" title="minimum of 'list input slot'" />. These new blocks should take a list as input and report the maximum or minimum value in the list.<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/max-of-list-reporting.png" alt="maximum of list {1, 22, 3, -4} reporting 22" title="maximum of list {1, 22, 3, -4} reporting 22" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/min-of-list-reporting.png" alt="minimum of list {1, 22, 3, -4} reporting -4" title="minimum of list {1, 22, 3, -4} reporting -4" />
                </li>
				<li>Test your <code>maximum of list</code> and <code>minimum of list</code> blocks by dragging a <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/list-full-size.png" alt="list ()" title="list ()" /> block into the input slot, giving it additional input spaces by clicking the right-facing triangle, and adding some numbers. Make sure both blocks work correctly before moving on.</li>
				<li>
					Design and answer a question to ask about your data that requires the either <code>maximum of list</code> or <code>minimum of list</code> block to answer it.
					<div class="endnote" style="clear: right;">For example, you might ask: "What's the maximum number of years that any of the people who responded to my survey have played their favorite sport?"</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>


		<h3>Finding a Sum</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="6">
				<li>
					Complete the block definition for the <code>sum of list</code> block so that it reports the sum of the items of a list.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/sum-of-list-reporting.png" alt="sum of {1, 2, 3, 10} reporting 16" title="sum of {1, 2, 3, 10} reporting 16" />
                </li>
				<li>Test the <code>sum of list</code> block with a list of numbers before moving on.</li>
				<li>
					Revisit your investigation topic, and if it makes sense, design and answer a question that requires the <code>sum</code> block to answer it.
					<div class="endnote">For example, you might ask: "How many years in total have the people who responded to my survey played their favorite sport?"</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>


		<h3>Finding an Average</h3>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="9">
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> How do you find the average of a list of numbers?

				</li>
				<li>
                    Complete the block definition for the <code>average of list</code> block so that it calculates the average of the values in a list:<br />

							<p><a href="#hint-average3" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for another hint about building the 'average' block.">Click for another hint.</a></p>
							<div id="hint-average3" class="collapse"><p>You'll need the <code>length</code> and <code>/</code> (division) blocks as well as the <code>sum of list</code> block you just finished building.</p></div>
						</div>
					</div>
                </li>
				<li>Test your code for the <code>average of list</code> block, and fix any problems.</li>
				<div class="takeNote">Notice that if you hadn't checked that your <code>sum of list</code> block works first, then you wouldn't know whether any problems with your <code>average of list</code> block were really problems with <code>average of list</code> or were actually problems with <code>sum of list</code>.</div>
				<li>
					<img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save" />
					Design and answer a question to ask about your data that requires the 	<code>average of list</code> block to answer it.
					<div class="endnote" style="clear: right;">For example, you might ask: "How many hours on average do the people who responded to my survey listen to music each day?"</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
