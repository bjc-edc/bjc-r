		<h2>Collecting Your Data</h2>
		<div class="todo">This page should probably be split into two or three pages. --MF, 1/11/23</div>

		<div class="learn">
            <p>In this activity, you will gather responses to your survey questions.</p>
        </div>
		<p>
			The data you collect will be stored as table. As you collect data, the list will fill up with additional rows, but the survey questions will remain as the first row of the survey. For example:<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/my-survey-watcher-questions-and-data.png" alt="'my survey' watcher: a table with four rows and two columns. Row 1 column 1 has the text: 'How many years have you been playing music?' and row 1 column 2 has the text: 'How many hours do you listen to music each day?' Row 2 has the values '6' and '1'. Row 3 has the values '0' and '3'. Row 4 has the values '2' and '1.5'." title="'my survey' watcher: a table with four rows and two columns. Row 1 column 1 has the text: 'How many years have you been playing music?' and row 1 column 2 has the text: 'How many hours do you listen to music each day?' Row 2 has the values '6' and '1'. Row 3 has the values '0' and '3'. Row 4 has the values '2' and '1.5'." />
		</p>

			The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/questions-only.png" alt="questions only from survey 'list input slot'" title="questions only from survey 'list input slot'" /> block takes a survey as input and reports its first row with all the questions.<br />
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/questions-only-reporting.png" alt=" questions only from survey (my survey) reporting the list {How many years have you been playing music?, How many hours do you listen to music each day?}" title="questions only from survey (my survey) reporting the list {How many years have you been playing music?, How many hours do you listen to music each day?}" />
		</p>


		<h3>Asking the User a Question</h3>
		<div class="todo">Next version, change name to <code>ask question</code>. --MF, 12/28/21 and PF</div>
		<p>
			This project also includes an <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/ask.png" alt="ask ()" title="ask ()" /> block that takes a question as input, asks the user the question, and reports the user's response.<br />
		</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol>
				<li>If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em>, and open your "Data Dos" project.</li>
				<li>
					<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" />
 Look at the code inside the <code>questions only</code> block, and discuss how the block works (even when the survey is full of data).
					<div class="endnote">Each row in a table is a list of items, and <code>item of</code> selects one. You learned about <code>item of</code> in <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L4/03-investigating-and-storing-images.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Lab 4 Activity 3: Investigating and Storing Images">Lab 4 Activity 3</a>.</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					Type a question into the <code>ask</code> block, and then click it to see how the responses will be entered into  Snap<em>!</em> and then reported by the <code>ask</code> block.
					<div class="endnote">
						<p><a href="#hint-ask" data-toggle="collapse" title="How does the ask block work?">How does <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/ask.png" alt="ask ()" title="ask ()" /> work?</a></p>

	report (answer)
}" title="ask (question) {
	ask (question) and wait
	report (answer)
}" />
							</p>
							<p>
								The <code>ask</code> block takes a question as input, asks the user the question, waits for a response, and then reports the user's response as the output of the function.

				<li><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" alt="Talk with Your Partner" title="Talk with Your Partner" /> What kinds of tools do you still need in order to use <code>questions only</code> and <code>ask</code> together to ask the user each question from your survey and store that data in the <var>my survey</var> variable?</li>
			</ol>

		<h3>Adding New Responses to Your Table</h3>
		<p>The missing tool is the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/map.png" alt="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" title="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" /> block, which performs an action to each item in a list. In this case, the action is to <code>ask</code> the user, and the list is the output of <code>questions only</code> from <code>my survey</code>.</p>
		<div class="endnote">You learned about the <code>map</code> block in <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L4/04-pixel-mapper.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 4 Activity 4: Transforming Every Pixel">Lab 4 Activity 4: Transforming Every Pixel</a>.</div>

					Complete the block definition for <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/new-response.png" alt="new response for 'list input slot'" title="new response for 'list input slot'" /> so that it takes a survey as input, asks the user each question in the survey, and reports a list of the user's responses. Test the block, and make sure it works before moving on to the next step: adding the user responses to the survey.<br />
					<div class="sidenoteBig">You'll need to drag the <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/my-survey.png" alt="my survey" title="my survey" /> variable out of the palette on the left and into the empty input slot.</div>

		<p>The <code>new response</code> block reports the user's data, but it doesn't send it anywhere. The <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/add.png" alt="add () to 'list input slot'" title="add () to 'list input slot'" /> block will take data and add it the end of a list.<br />

						You can remove the data from the survey either by:
