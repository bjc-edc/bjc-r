		<h2>Planning Your Survey</h2>
		<div class="todo">Review <a href="https://piazza.com/class/h8yx482idav52y?cid=3739">teacher challenges</a> before revising lab. --MF, 3/8/22</div>
		<div class="learn">
			<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will design a more sophisticated research investigation on a topic that interests you, and you will create tools to gather data and analyze the results.</p>
			<p><strong>In this activity,</strong> you will choose a research question and design and set up your survey.</p>

		<h3>Designing a Research Plan</h3>
		<p>In <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U1/L3/01-gathering-data.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 3: Dealing with Data">Lab 3: Dealing with Data</a>, you used a survey to collect data about one question (such as favorite ice cream flavor, music genre, fruit, sport, pizza topping, etc.) and created a pictograph of the results. You've learned a lot since then. Now, you can create a survey with <em>multiple</em> questions and use Snap<em>!</em> to process the results.</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<div class="takeNote">For privacy, don't design a research plan that requires asking for personal information such as name, address, phone number, birthday, etc.</div>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Choose a topic of investigation, and design two or more survey questions to research your topic. Your survey should take numbers as responses to at least one question.
					<div class="endnote" style="clear: both;">
						<p>
							<em>Example Investigation Topic:</em> Do people stick with some sports longer than other sports?
							<ul>
								<li><em>Possible Survey Questions:</em>
									<ul>
										<li>What sport do you practice most?</li>
										<li>How many years have you been practicing that sport?</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>Example Investigation Topic:</em> Do people who have practiced music longer listen to more music?
							<ul>
								<li><em>Possible Survey Questions:</em>
									<ul>
										<li>How many years have you been playing music?</li>
										<li>How many hours do you listen to music each day?</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>

		<h3>Designing a Data Processing Strategy</h3>
		<p>
			In upcoming activities, you will learn about and create tools that allow Snap<em>!</em> to:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Process only data matching a certain condition (such as if a response equals a certain value or is greater than or less than some value)<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/keep-soccer.png" alt="keep items (() = soccer) from 'list input slot'" title="keep items (() = soccer) from 'list input slot'" />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/keep-gt3.png" alt="keep items (() > 3) from 'list input slot'" title="keep items (() > 3) from 'list input slot'" />
				</li>
				<li>
					Find the length of a list, the sum or average of a list's values, or the maximum or minimum value in a list:<br />
					<img class="smallindent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/length-list.png" alt="length of 'list input slot'" title="length of 'list input slot'" />
					<img class="smallindent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/sum-of-list.png" alt="sum of 'list input slot'" title="sum of 'list input slot'" />
					<img class="smallindent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/average-of-list.png" alt="saverageum of 'list input slot'" title="average of 'list input slot'" />
					<img class="smallindent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/maximum-of-list.png" alt="maximum of 'list input slot'" title="maximum of 'list input slot'" />
					<img class="smallindent" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab07/minimum-of-list.png" alt="minimum of 'list input slot'" title="minimum of 'list input slot'" />
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="2">
				<li>
					Come up with an overall strategy for using those Snap<em>!</em> blocks to investigate your question.
					If you realize your survey questions can't be researched using those blocks, you should redesign your survey before you go on.

								<em>Example Investigation Topic:</em> Do people stick with some sports longer than other sports?
								<ul>
									<li><em>Possible data processing strategy:</em> Make Snap<em>!</em> process the data for each sport played one at a time and find the average years spent playing each one.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Example Investigation Topic:</em> Do people who have practiced music longer listen to more music?
								<ul>
									<li><em>Possible data processing strategy:</em> Make Snap<em>!</em> identify the maximum, minimum, and average number of years spent playing music, use that  to choose a cutoff value (such as three years of playing music), and then have Snap<em>!</em> find the average hours spent listening for people who have played more than or less than that cutoff value and compare.</li>
