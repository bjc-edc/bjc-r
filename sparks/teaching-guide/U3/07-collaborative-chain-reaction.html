		<h2>Lab 7: Collaborative Chain Reaction</h2>
		<p>A chain reaction (or Rube Goldberg machine) is a series of causes and effects that often results in the accomplishment of a simple task. The sequence of events is often absurd or convoluted, but that is the beauty in creating one of these machines. In this lab, students will work together to create a chain reaction machine that blends micro:bit with analog materials. Students map out a plan, run tests on their segments, and perform collectively the chain reaction machine.</p>

		<h3>Daily Activity: Computing in the News.<a name="DA" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<p>Every day of BJC should begin with a 5-minute student presentation on a recent news article about computing. This helps build a foundation for considering the impacts of  computing technologies on employment, issues of bias and accessibility, and tradeoffs between public access to information and security. Read <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" title="Computing in the News" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> for additional details and suggested news sources.</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Assign to one student or a pair of students a recent news article about computing for them to read and then summarize for the class during the next class period.</li>
					</ul>

				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Pick a place for students to build their chain reactions. This can take up quite a lot of room, so pick a space with ample room for building as well as additional materials.</li>
                        <li>Place chain reaction materials nearby so students have easy access to balls, ramps, and other building materials.</li>
                        <li>Set a date for the chain reaction finale to invite friends, family, and other students and teachers to join in the celebration.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Make a plan for a multi-step project with their partner.</li>
                        <li>Collaborate with neighboring teams on how segments will connect.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students see what materials are available to then before making a plan.</li>
                        <li>Pairs articulate what materials they will need for their segment, how they will utilize both micro:bits, and how their segment will connect with neighboring segments.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
                        <li>Tables are great building surfaces, and each pair of students can use one table for building. Place tables in a zig-zag (non-linear) formation to add more complex movements between segments.</li>
                        <li>If possible, keep student projects undisturbed for the duration of their building. If that isn't possible, consider having them build on pieces of cardboard that then can be moved at the end of class and stored safely.</li>
                        <li>Make tape marks on the table where connections will occur between two pairs of students.</li>
					</ul>

					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Before launching the chain reaction, ask all students to clean up their workspaces of any extra materials.</li>
						<li>Find a place in the room where students and others who are watching can see the entire chain reaction. If that's challenging to do, consider filming the chain reaction set-off so that others can see it at a later time.</li>
						<li>Consider adding an announcer who will narrate the chain reaction finale. This can be you, a student, or someone else. It will help for those who can't see the small up-close details to hear what's happening.</li>
						<li>Ask each student pair to present what will happen at each stage of their chain reaction segment.</li>
						<li>If a segment of a student's chain reaction doesn't work as intended, ask them to help their segment along by making a small change.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-CS-03: Systematically identify and fix problems with computing devices and their components.</strong> Since a computing device may interact with interconnected devices within a system, problems may not be due to the specific computing device itself but to devices connected to it. Just as pilots use checklists to troubleshoot problems with aircraft systems, students should use a similar, structured process to troubleshoot problems with computing systems and ensure that potential solutions are not overlooked. Examples of troubleshooting strategies include following a troubleshooting flow diagram, making changes to software to see if hardware will work, checking connections and settings, and swapping in working components. </li>

				<li><strong>2-AP-18: Distribute tasks and maintain a project timeline when collaboratively developing computational artifacts.</strong> Collaboration is a common and crucial practice in programming development. Often, many individuals and groups work on the interdependent parts of a project together. Students should assume pre-defined roles within their teams and manage the project workflow using structured timelines. With teacher guidance, they will begin to create collective goals, expectations, and equitable workloads. For example, students may divide the design stage of a game into planning the storyboard, flowchart, and different parts of the game mechanics. They can then distribute tasks and roles among members of the team and assign deadlines. </li>
