		<h2>Lab 3: Game Play</h2>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>Trouble shooting: If students are having trouble with the circuits, have then try closing the circuit without any materials by directly connecting and disconnecting the ends of the two alligator clips and checking that their code is responding the way they would want if the circuit were closed/opened with their physical materials. If it doesn't work with the alligator clips, try checking the connection between the clips and the micro:bit board. If it does work with the alligator clips, try connecting one alligator clip at its intended connection point and touching the second clip at various points along the path of the circuit to identify the problem spot. (Also need to be clear about what a circuit is and what matters/doesn't matter in setting up the aluminum foil, etc.) --MF, 7/27/23</p>
		</div>

		<p>Students pair up to create their own games to play with other classmates. They can use only the micro:bit or also additional craft materials (see <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U3/L3/01-game-design.html">Activity 1</a> for details). Students are introduced to <code>variables</code> and the input/output (I/O) pins on the hardware. After completing their games, students introduce their projects to one for feedback to iterate on their design.</p>

				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Provide physical example projects for students to play to help in their own brainstorming process.</li>
						<li>Make available pens and paper for student pairs to use when brainstorming.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Collaborate with a partner to create a project design.</li>
						<li>Document the plan by sketching and writing on a piece of paper.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Introduce the project by showcasing examples for students to try themselves.</li>
						<li>Pair up students or ask students their own partner.</li>
						<li>Encourage brainstorming and identifying multiple possible projects before selecting the one that they want to pursue.</li>
						<li>Sketch and write down the game and its rules, its inputs and outputs, and any physical build that's required.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>As much as possible, it's helpful to be explicit with project planning at this stage. It's okay if projects evolve as students build, but the next activity will be much easier if there's a clear plan identified early.</li>

		<ul>
			<li>In what ways did your students successfully collaborate during this lab? In what ways was this paired project challenging?</li>
			<li>Was student feedback on projects successful? If so, how? If not, please explain.</li>
			<li>Did students choose to make switches as seen in the Skeeball example? If so, about how many students chose this path?</li>
			<li>How many students did micro:bit-only games? How many used physical materials?</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Correlation with CSTA Standards<a name="Standards" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-CS-01: Recommend improvements to the design of computing devices, based on an analysis of how users interact with the devices.</strong> The study of humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI) can improve the design of devices, including both hardware and software. Students should make recommendations for existing devices (e.g., a laptop, phone, or tablet) or design their own components or interface (e.g., create their own controllers). Teachers can guide students to consider usability through several lenses, including accessibility, ergonomics, and learnability. For example, assistive devices provide capabilities such as scanning written information and converting it to speech. </li>
