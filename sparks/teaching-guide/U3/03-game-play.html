		<h2>Lab 3: Game Play</h2>
		<p>Students pair up to create their own games to play with other classmates. They can just the micro:bit or additional craft materials (see <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U3/L3/01-game-design.html">Activity 1</a> for details). Students are introduced to <code>variables</code> and the input/output (I/O) pins on the hardware. After completing their games, students introduce their projects to one for feedback to iterate on their design.</p>

		<h3>Daily Activity: Computing in the News.<a name="DA" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<p>Every day of BJC should begin with a 5-minute student presentation on a recent news article about computing. This helps build a foundation for considering the impacts of  computing technologies on employment, issues of bias and accessibility, and tradeoffs between public access to information and security. Read <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" title="Computing in the News" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> for additional details and suggested news sources.</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Assign to one student or a pair of students a recent news article about computing for them to read and then summarize for the class during the next class period.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Materials:</strong> <a href="/bjc-r/sparks/student-pages/U3/L3/01-game-design.html" title="Activity 1: Game Design" target="_blank">Game Design</a> student page</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Provide physical example projects for students to play to help in their own brainstorming process.</li>
                        <li>Make available pens and paper for student pairs to use when brainstorming.</li>

						<li>Collaborate with a partner to create a project design.</li>
                        <li>Document the plan by sketching and writing on a piece of paper.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Introduce the project by showcasing examples for students to try themselves.</li>
                        <li>Pair up students or ask students their own partner.</li>
                        <li>Encourage brainstorming and identifying multiple possible projects before selecting the one that they want to pursue.</li>
                        <li>Sketch and write down the game and its rules, its inputs and outputs, and any physical build that's required.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
                        <li>As much as possible, it's helpful to be explicit with project planning at this stage. It's okay if projects evolve as students build, but the next activity will be much easier if there's a clear plan identified early.</li>

		<h3>Correlation with CSTA Standards<a name="Standards" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<strong>2-CS-01: Recommend improvements to the design of computing devices, based on an analysis of how users interact with the devices.</strong> The study of humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI) can improve the design of devices, including both hardware and software. Students should make recommendations for existing devices (e.g., a laptop, phone, or tablet) or design their own components or interface (e.g., create their own controllers). Teachers can guide students to consider usability through several lenses, including accessibility, ergonomics, and learnability. For example, assistive devices provide capabilities such as scanning written information and converting it to speech. </li>
