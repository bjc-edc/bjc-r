		<h2>Lab 2: Interactive Pet</h2>
		<p>Students plan and design their own interactive pet using the micro:bit and learn about inputs and outputs using hardware. They use the micro:bit's light and tilt sensors as inputs (changes to the pet's environment) and the LED display as outputs (the pet's response). Students use "hat blocks" such as <code>when ()</code> and <code>when button () pressed</code> to initiate code in response to inputs so events in the pet's environment trigger the pet's response.</p>

		<p>Alongside programming, students craft a physical body for their pet that houses the micro:bit while keeping the LED screen and buttons accessible. The body should communicate something about the pet that then is reinforced through its programmed behaviors.</p>

						<li>Encourage storytelling beyond listing inputs and outputs. Describe an encounter with the Interactive Pet. What is the experience like? What happens when you try to communicate with the pet?</li>
						<li>Sharing is an important part of the process. It's an opportunity for students to see different ways of creating interactions with micro:bit. Consider what mode of sharing works best for your students. One idea is to create an interactive petting zoo where students can go and meet each of the interactive pets alongside their documentation to know how to interact with them.</li>

		<div class="todo">Deanna, are there any standards you were thinking of for this lab? --MF, 1/28/22</div>
		<h3>Correlation with CSTA Standards<a name="Standards" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-CS-02: Design projects that combine hardware and software components to collect and exchange data.</strong> Collecting and exchanging data involves input, output, storage, and processing. When possible, students should select the hardware and software components for their project designs by considering factors such as functionality, cost, size, speed, accessibility, and aesthetics. For example, components for a mobile app could include accelerometer, GPS, and speech recognition. The choice of a device that connects wirelessly through a Bluetooth connection versus a physical USB connection involves a tradeoff between mobility and the need for an additional power source for the wireless device.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-19: Document programs in order to make them easier to follow, test, and debug.</strong> Documentation allows creators and others to more easily use and understand a program. Students should provide documentation for end users that explains their artifacts and how they function. For example, students could provide a project overview and clear user instructions. They should also incorporate comments in their product and communicate their process using design documents, flowcharts, and presentations. </li>
