		<h2>Lab 4: Marvelous Movements</h2>
		<div class="todo">
			<p>Lots of notes in PD 2023 papers. --MF, 7/27/23</p>

		</div>

		<p>Students create unique moving creations using servo motors. They learn how to program them using servo commands, including <code>set servo to degrees</code>, <code>set servo to speed</code>, and <code>stop servo</code>. Then, students will make their own projects inspired by servo movement that builds on their learning in previous labs.</p>

		<h3>Daily Activity: Computing in the News.<a name="DA" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<p>Every day of BJC should begin with a 5-minute student presentation on a recent news article about computing. This helps build a foundation for considering the impacts of  computing technologies on employment, issues of bias and accessibility, and tradeoffs between public access to information and security. Read <a href="/bjc-r/cur/teaching-guide/U1/general-support/computing-in-the-news.html" title="Computing in the News" target="_blank">Computing in the News</a> for additional details and suggested news sources.</p>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Assign to one student or a pair of students a recent news article about computing for them to read and then summarize for the class during the next class period.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Set up a zone for all of the crafting materials that's easy for students to access.</li>
                        <li>Consider supplementing materials based on what you have available in your space.</li>
                        <li>Clear off work surfaces so students have space to program and build in the same location.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Create movement by programming a servo motor.</li>
                        <li>Use a breakout board to control a servo motor using micro:bit.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Walk through setting up the Bit Booster board as a class.</li>
                        <li>Make one servo move and attach that movement to a micro:bit input.</li>
                        <li>Make another servo movement connected to another input.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
                        <li>
                            When troubleshooting the servos, check the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The direction of the servo wires (orange is positive, brown is negative).</li>
                                <li>The direction of the battery wires (red is positive, black is negative).</li>
                                <li>The direction the micro:bit is facing.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

		<h3>Feedback</h3>
		<p>Your feedback is critical to the success of this pilot. Please let us know how each lab went. For this lab, you might provide feedback such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Did you experience any challenges working with servo motors? If so, what were they?</li>
			<li>Did students make a variety of projects with servos? If so, what were they? If not, why do you think this was the case?</li>
			<li>Were students able to move the servo motor as intended? If not, please explain their intended movement.</li>

		<h3>Correlation with CSTA Standards<a name="Standards" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<strong>2-CS-01: Recommend improvements to the design of computing devices, based on an analysis of how users interact with the devices.</strong> The study of humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI) can improve the design of devices, including both hardware and software. Students should make recommendations for existing devices (e.g., a laptop, phone, or tablet) or design their own components or interface (e.g., create their own controllers). Teachers can guide students to consider usability through several lenses, including accessibility, ergonomics, and learnability. For example, assistive devices provide capabilities such as scanning written information and converting it to speech. </li>
