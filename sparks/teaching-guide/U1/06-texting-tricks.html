		<h2>Lab 6: Texting Tricks</h2>
		<p>At this point, students have learned a variety of functional programming techniques. In Lab 1, they nested blocks to use the output of one block as the input to another. In Lab 2, they used lists to store a selection of possible words, used <code>join</code> to add an "s" to the end of a word, and created new blocks that accept inputs. In Lab 4, they learned how images are stored as a list of lists (a list of pixels each containing a list of color values), and they used the higher-order function <code>map</code> to select a single color value from every pixel in a list. In Lab 5, they nested a more complex series of blocks to encode and decode messages.</p>
		<p>Here in Lab 6, students extend their growing facility with functional programming to create and analyze code with nested functions. They learn several new blocks: the relatively simple <code>split</code> block, which students use to divide a text string into a list of letters; the <code>if then else</code> block, which they use to make decisions based on a predicate (testing function); and the higher-order function <code>find first</code>, which identifies the first list item that passes a predicate test.</p>
		<p><img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab06/emojify-i-love-rain-reporting.png" alt="emojify ('I love rain) reporting 'I ❤️ ☔️ '" title="emojify ('I love rain) reporting 'I ❤️ ☔️ '" />These more advanced concepts are developed in the playful context of embellishing text with emojis and alternate spellings used in texting and on the Internet, and the lab culminates with a non-programming opportunity to consider issues of bias in the range of emojis available and with students designing an emoji of their own.</p>

						<li>Styling Your Text Messages: Students experiment with several text processing blocks and write descriptions of what they do. You may choose to have students write their descriptions on paper or on the computer; later they will refine their descriptions as they write "help text" for one or more of the blocks. (10&ndash;25 minutes)</li>
						<li>Adding Program Documentation: Students learn about program documentation, how to use comments in Snap<em>!</em>, and how to use comments to create help text for blocks.  (10&ndash;30 minutes)</li>
						<li>Export Text Messages: Students export the output of their text processing blocks so they can paste the results outside of Snap<em>!</em>. (Optional: 5&ndash;10 minutes, if used)</li>
						<li>Draw a Conversation: Students use a <code>draw convo with messages</code> block to create a simulation of a text conversation on the Snap<em>!</em> stage. (Optional: 5&ndash;10 minutes, if used)</li>

					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>What is L33t? Students learn about leet, a modified spelling system created in the 1980s, and what it will take to build a block that converts text into leet. Consider whether reading this as a class or in small groups might be more effective for your students than reading individually would be. (5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>
						<li>Creating a Letter-Changing Function. Students use the reporter form of the <code>if</code> conditional together with a predicate to create a function that takes one letter as input and if the letter the target for their change (such as "e"), then it reports the replacement character (such as "3"), and otherwise reports the input letter. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li><code>Map</code>ping the Letter-Changing Function Over All the Letters. Students use their <code>change letter</code> block together with <code>split</code>, <code>map</code>, and <code>join</code> to create a block that takes a word or phrase as input and reports the same word or phrase with all instances of one letter replaced by a number. This section includes several optional extension activities. (10&ndash;40 minutes)</li>
						<li>Post-activity Show &amp; Tell. You may wish to have students share the their <code>l33t</code> blocks, any project extensions they completed, and any ideas for project extensions they have. (Optional: 10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>

			<p>Pamela, given our new helper block setup, I didn't see a good way to integrate this project extension, but if you do, please LMK. --MF, 10/28/21</p>
			You can change emojify to generate random emojis by changing: <img class="" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab06/item-2-of-word-emoji-pair.png" alt="" title="" /> to: <img class="" src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab06/item-random-of-all-but-first-of-word-emoji-pair.png" alt="" title="" /> Then you can add additional emojis to each list, and it will pick randomly from them.
			<p>We'll consider adding this next year (also need to add <code>all but first</code> to XML) to do this. --MF, 11/2/21<br />

						<li>If you opt to use this activity, read through the student page and the links with optional reading, and be sure you understand how the <code>emojify</code>, <code>emojify word</code>, <code>emoji from pair</code>, and <code>find first</code> blocks work before leading this activity with students.</li>
						<li>Consider how you plan to run this activity. You could have students work through the page in pairs or small groups discussing as they go. You could work through the whole page together as a class. Or you would have students work in pairs or groups and then bring the class together periodically for discussions to make sure they understand each block before moving on.</li>

					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>

						<li>Using <code>Find First</code> to Make <code>Emojify Word</code>. Students learn the functionality of the <code>find first</code> block and analyze it's use in <code>emojify word</code> to search a list of lists. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Using <code>If Then Else</code> to Make <code>Emoji from Pair</code>. Students learn the <code>is () a ()? </code> block and review the <code>if then else</code> and <code>item  of</code> blocks as they analyze the <code>emoji from pair</code> block used by <code>emojify word</code>. (5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>
						<li>Using <code>Emojify Word</code> to Make <code>Emojify</code>. Students review <code>map</code>, <code>join</code>, and <code>split</code> as they analyze how the <code>emojify</code> block uses <code>emojify word</code>. After a discussion, they write a description and help text for the block, and then edit <code>emojify word</code> to add one or more word/emoji pairs of their choosing. (10&ndash;25 minutes)</li>

								Write a paragraph describing how the <code>emojify</code> block works. Example paragraph:

		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-AP-13: Decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs.</strong> Students should break down problems into subproblems, which can be further broken down to smaller parts. Decomposition facilitates aspects of program development by allowing students to focus on one piece at a time (e.g., getting input from the user, processing the data, and displaying the result to the user). Decomposition also enables different students to work on different parts at the same time. For example, animations can be decomposed into multiple scenes, which can be developed independently.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-19: Document programs in order to make them easier to follow, test, and debug.</strong> Documentation allows creators and others to more easily use and understand a program. Students should provide documentation for end users that explains their artifacts and how they function. For example, students could provide a project overview and clear user instructions. They should also incorporate comments in their product and communicate their process using design documents, flowcharts, and presentations.</li>
				<li><strong>2-IC-21: Discuss issues of bias and accessibility in the design of existing technologies.</strong> Students should test and discuss the usability of various technology tools (e.g., apps, games, and devices) with the teacher's guidance. For example, facial recognition software that works better for lighter skin tones was likely developed with a homogeneous testing group and could be improved by sampling a more diverse population. When discussing accessibility, students may notice that allowing a user to change font sizes and colors will not only make an interface usable for people with low vision but also benefits users in various situations, such as in bright daylight or a dark room.</li>
