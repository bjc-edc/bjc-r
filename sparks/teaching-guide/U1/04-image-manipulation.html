		<h2>Lab 4: Image Manipulation</h2>
		<p>This lab teaches about pixels&mdash;what they are, how they make up an image on the screen, and how manipulating their red, green, and blue values can change an image. Students begin by watching a video demonstrating that a screen is indeed made up of tiny squares of red, green, and blue. They then view an image made up of large pixels at low resolution and increase the resolution (while shrinking the pixels) to see the pixels disappear as the image becomes more visible. Students then learn about lists and tables as they explore the RGB values of pixels in an image, explore the higher-order function <code>map</code> as they select a single color value from each pixel in an image, and explore several filters that apply a transformation to each pixel of an image. </p>

		<h3>Pacing</h3>

					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Learn that images are made up of pixels, which can be stored as lists of color values.</li>
						<li>Learn that pixels are made up of varying levels of red, green, and blue elements.</li>

					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students watch a video demonstrating that screens are made up of pixels. They then experiment in Snap<em>!</em> with photos at various resolutions. Show a mystery image at lowest resolution, gradually increase the resolution until students begin guessing the image, and keep track of the resolution at which students successfully guess the picture.

					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Explore various Snap<em>!</em> costumes and their pixels.</li>
						<li>Learn that images are stored as tables (lists of lists), in which each row is one pixel.</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students learn about Snap<em>!</em> costumes and zoom in on an image of their choosing to see the RGB values of each pixel. (5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>
						<li>Optionally, students may add their own image to the Snap<em>!</em> project. (5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>

					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>The "If There is Time" activity invites students to add their own images to the Snap<em>!</em> project either by taking a picture with a webcam or dragging an image file into the "Costumes" tab in Snap<em>!</em>. If your class (or any given student or group of students) has extra time, this can be a fun way to personalize the project and learn new Snap<em>!</em> features, but as with any "If There Is Time" extension, it's not necessary for understanding the learning goals of this page.</li>
						<li>Troubleshooting: If students exploring the "If There Is Time..." activities aren't able to use their camera with Snap<em>!</em>, they may need to update their browser.</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>If you aren't familiar and comfortable with the higher-order function <code>map</code>, you may want to work through the activity on your own before supporting students through this activity. There is additional information about the <code>map</code> function in the section on "Higher-Order List Operations and Rings" in  the <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/help/SnapManual.pdf" title="Snap! Reference Manual" target="_blank">Snap<em>!</em> Reference Manual</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Learn how to select a item out of a list and a single cell out of a table.</li>
						<li>Use <code>map</code> to apply functions to every element in a list.</li>
						<li>Read more complex expressions with nesting functions.</li>
						<li>Explore several image filters that transform each pixel in an image.</li>

					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>

					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>There are several sets of optional, extension activities on this page:
							<ul>
    							<li>The first "If There is Time" invites students to take a look at the code behind the <code>color from pixel</code> block. This code uses predicates and reporters, which aren't introduced until Unit 2. It's not recommended to teach this content now, but, being a fairly readable block of code, is offered as a preview of what is to come.</li>
								<li>The second set of "If There is Time" prompt invites students to adjust the inputs to Mystery Filter #1 to achieve other goals. </li>
								<li>The third "If There is Time" set asks a deeper question about multiplying zero by a percentage.</li>
								<li>There is also a "Take It Further" prompt that invites students to create additional image filters of their own design.</li>

								<p class="indent">The <code>map</code> expression reports a list of only the red pixels from the <code>pixels of costume</code> table.</p>

							<li>
								What does this <code>map</code> expression do?
								<p class="indent">The <code>map</code> expression reports a list of only the selected color channel from the <code>pixels of costume</code> table.</p>

								Mystery Filter #1:
								<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
									<li>
										If an area of the resulting image is black, what does that mean about the original color?
										<p class="indent">The original color in that area had no red.</p>

									<li>
										What kinds of images would turn mostly or completely black with this filter?
										<p class="indent">Images that have very little red in them will turn mostly black.</p>
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								(If There Is Time) How could you make a filter that showed only the green or only the blue values?
									<p class="indent">
										Change the first input to the <code>color from pixel</code> block to green or blue, move the <code>color from pixel</code> block to the green or blue input slot of <code>RGB pixel</code>, and put a 0 in its place:<br />

							</li>
							<li>
								Then drag the <code>RGB pixel</code> block out of the <code>paint color</code> block and into the <code>scale pixel</code> block, and click the new <code>scale pixel</code> expression. How does the <code>scale pixel</code> block change the values of the input pixel?

									The <code>scale pixel</code> block scales the values of the input pixel by the input percentages.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								What do you think will happen if you drag the <code>scale pixel</code> expression into the <code>paint color</code> block and click it?
								<p class="indent">
									<img src="/bjc-r/sparks/img/U1/lab04/paint-color-scale-RGB-pixel.png" alt="paint color, RGB (scale red to (200%) green to (200%) blue to (200%) for pixel (RGB pixel, red: (128) green: (64) blue: (0)))" title="paint color, RGB (scale red to (200%) green to (200%) blue to (200%) for pixel (RGB pixel, red: (128) green: (64) blue: (0)))" /><br />
									It paints an orange color on the stage.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								Mystery Filter #2:
								<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
									<li>
										Can you make the image even brighter?
										<p class="indent">Yes, by significantly raising the percentage inputs (such as to 400%) to the <code>scale pixel</code> block.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										Can you make the image much darker?
										<p class="indent">Yes, by significantly reducing the percentage inputs (such as to 50%) to the <code>scale pixel</code> block.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										What happens if you scale different colors to different percentages of their original values?
										<p class="indent">Color channels with percentage values greater than 100% will be made brighter. Color channels with percentage values less than 100% will be made darker.</p>
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>
								The <code>scale up</code> block won't change black pixels. Why not?
								<p class="indent">The RGB value of a black pixel is 0, 0, 0. Multiplying 0 by any percentage will not chance its value.</p>
