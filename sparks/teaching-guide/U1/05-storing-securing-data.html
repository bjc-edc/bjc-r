		<h2>Lab 5: Storing and Securing Data</h2>
		<p>Having learned that images are stored as lists of pixels, which are themselves lists, students now dig deeper to understand how computers store that data as bits. In activities 1-3, students explore mathematical functions in Snap<em>!</em>, learn about binary representation (and optionally also hexadecimal), and learn that computers use binary to store data in on/off electrical signals. In activities 4 and 5, students encode and decode messages and learn about substitution ciphers both offline and in Snap<em>!</em>.</p>

		<div class="todo">
			Next time around, we should add content to cover (maybe an extra page like 1.6.4, Emoji Deep Dive):
			<p><strong>2-NI-05: Explain how physical and digital security measures protect electronic information.</strong> Information that is stored online is vulnerable to unwanted access. Examples of physical security measures to protect data include keeping passwords hidden, locking doors, making backup copies on external storage devices, and erasing a storage device before it is reused. Examples of digital security measures include secure router admin passwords, firewalls that limit access to private networks, and the use of a protocol such as HTTPS to ensure secure data transmission.</p>
			<p><strong>2-IC-23: Describe tradeoffs between allowing information to be public and keeping information private and secure.</strong> Sharing information online can help establish, maintain, and strengthen connections between people. For example, it allows artists and designers to display their talents and reach a broad audience. However, security attacks often start with personal information that is publicly available online. Social engineering is based on tricking people into revealing sensitive information and can be thwarted by being wary of attacks, such as phishing and spoofing.</p>

							If you have time after students answer the questions on the student activity page in their pairs, you may wish to discuss the various "Talk with Your Partner" questions as a class:
							<ul>
								<li>
									After the "Storing Numbers in Bits" section:
									<ul>
										<li>Can you find a number that's the same in decimal and binary?</li>
										<li>Can you get a result that's all 1s? Hint: Start by trying to get just one 1, then two 1s, etc.</li>
										<li>Can you get a result that's 11110000? You may need a calculator and/or a teacher to figure this one out.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									After the "Storing Bits as Electricity" section:
									<ul>
										<li>What numbers result in no capacitors charged at all?</li>
										<li>What numbers make all the capacitors light up with charge?</li>
										<li>What's a number that charges every capacitor but one?</li>
									</ul>

					<div id="hint-solutions-A2" class="collapse">
						<ul>
							<li>
								Can you find a number that's the same in decimal and binary?
								<ul>
									<li>0 and 1 are the only numbers that are the same.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Can you get a result that's all ones?
								<ul>
									<li>
										Every decimal that is one less than a power of 2 is all ones. For example:
										<ul>
											<li>1<sub>10</sub> = 1<sub>2</sub> = (2 - 1)<sub>10</sub></li>
											<li>3<sub>10</sub> = 11<sub>2</sub> = (4 - 1)<sub>10</sub></li>
											<li>7<sub>10</sub> = 111<sub>2</sub> = (8 - 1)<sub>10</sub></li>
											<li>etc.</li>
										</ul>
										That's because in binary, powers of 2 are always a one followed by a bunch of zeros, so the number just before is all ones. It's analogous to 9, 99, 999, etc. in decimal; the number that is all nines is always one less than the power of 10.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Can you get a result that's 11110000?
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>An easy way is to type "11110000 in decimal" in Google, and it will calculate it for you!</p>
										To manually calculate it, write out the powers of 2 under each bit in the number:
										<div class="indent bordered-table" style="width:500px; grid-template-columns: auto auto auto auto auto auto auto auto;">
											<div>1</div>
											<div>1</div>
											<div>1</div>
											<div>1</div>
											<div>0</div>
											<div>0</div>
											<div>0</div>
											<div>0</div>
											<div>128</div>
											<div>64</div>
											<div>32</div>
											<div>16</div>
											<div>8</div>
											<div>4</div>
											<div>2</div>
											<div>1</div>
										</div>
										Then add up the powers that have a 1 in that place: 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								What numbers result in no capacitors charged at all?
								<ul>
									<li>Only the number 0 results in no capacitors charged. Every other number would need at least one capacitor charged.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								What numbers make all the capacitors light up with charge?
								<ul>
									<li>This is the same as the question about making numbers with all ones from the previous section. Any decimal number that's one less than a power of 2 will result in a row of charged capacitors.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								What's a decimal numeral that charges every capacitor but one?
								<ul>
									<li>
										There are lots of numbers that can answer this question! Here are some early ones:
										<div class="indent bordered-table two-col" style="width:200px; text-align:center;">
											<div class="header">Decimal</div>
												<div class="header">Binary</div>
											<div>2</div>
												<div>10</div>
											<div>5</div>
												<div>101</div>
											<div>6</div>
												<div>110</div>
										</div>
										There's not a pattern to all the answers, so students can play with different decimal values until they find ones with a matching capacitor pattern, or they can write out binary sequences with only one 0 and then work out the decimal equivalent.

							<li>
							There are two prompts on the student-facing page asking students to consider how to decode a message without knowing know the shift (in the case of a Caesar/shift cipher) or the key (in the case of the more general simple substitution cipher). Here are a few common approaches:
							<ul>
								<li>Brute force: Try every possible shift. That's just 26 different shifts to try for the Caesar Cipher. That may feel like a lot if you're doing it by hand, but with a computer, that's very doable. (For the modern encryption methods used on computers, there are 340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 keys, so it'd take a computer trillions of years to try every possible shift key!)</li>
								<li>Known text: If you had any idea about what the message contained, it'd be easier to narrow down possible shift keys. For example, if you knew an encoded letter started with "Dear", you'd just have to figure out what shift key resulted in the encoded version of that. You might also notice the same encoded word show up multiple times and suspect it's a common word like "the", and use that to figure out the likely shift key. Even for a simple substitution cipher, this approach can be helpful since knowing three or four letters may help you guess other words leading to more known letters.</li>
								<li>Frequency analysis: Some letters are much more frequent than others in the English language ("E" is the most common). If the encoded text is very long, you could analyze which letters are the most frequent, and then make an educated guess about their decrypted identity. For example, if you saw "W" the most often, you might guess it was the encryption of "E", and so on.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>An If There Is Time prompt asks students how to make the encryption more secure. A shift/Caesar cipher is one of the least secure ciphers, since every letter is shifted by the same amount (once you've cracked one letter, you've cracked them all!), and there are only a relatively small number of possible shift keys (26). To make a more secure cipher, you ideally want an encryption technique that changes different letters in different ways and that has many possible keys. An example is the Vigenère Cipher, from the 1500, which used multi-word phrases as shift keys, and then swapped out letters according to a table created from that shift key. The Vigenère cipher was eventually cracked, especially as computers came about that were able to quickly analyze possible shift keys and decryptions. Modern encryption techniques use shift keys that are 128 bits long and require applying a complex sequence of mathematical operations for <em>every</em> bit in the key.</li>

						<li>Working with Lists: Students learn that the <code>unicode of</code>, <code>+</code>, and <code>unicode as letter</code> blocks can each accept a <em>list</em> as input (not just single values) and that they will report a new list with the results of performing that function on all elements of the list. Students then nest these blocks to encode/decode whole words and/or sentences at a time.  (5&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Generalizing the Process: In small groups or as a class, students discuss how encoding and decoding compare, how these processes varied for each person's message and shift value, and how to generalize the process. Lastly, they create a custom block that generalizes the process. (10&ndash;45 minutes)</li>

					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Here are a few common mistakes when making the <code>message shifted by</code> block:
							<ul>
    							<li>Using a command block instead of a reporter block. In this case, the block editor won't open with a <code>report</code> block.</li>
								<li>Not removing the second default argument of the <code>join</code> block. Outputs may have the word "world" appended to the end.</li>
								<li>Nesting the blocks in correctly. You might have students go back and start with converting a specific message into Unicode (and testing that), then adding an outer block to shift (and testing that), then shifting back (and testing), then <code>join</code>ing (and testing), and then finally creating a reporter, adding that code (testing once more), and finally adding the local variables.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							There are several opportunities for small group or class discussions. Regardless of which discussion format you use, ensure that your students to consider these questions.
							<ul>
								<li>(If There is Time&mdash;optional) How could you use Snap! to help you decode a message that was created with a simple substitution cipher <em>without knowing the key</em>?</li>
								<li>
									Discuss how you decoded the message you received, and listen to how other people decoded the messages they received.
									<ul>
									    <li>How did the process of encoding the message compare to the process of decoding the message?</li>
										<li>What parts of the encoding/decoding process were the same for everyone and what parts were different?</li>
										<li>How could make a general process that will work for all messages and all shift values?</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>How can you use this same block to decode a message?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>You may opt have some or all students explore the If There is Time or Take It Further exercises. Take It Further exercises are generally more involved than the For You to Do or If There Is Time exercises. </li>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-NI-06: Apply multiple methods of encryption to model the secure transmission of information.</strong> Encryption can be as simple as letter substitution or as complicated as modern methods used to secure networks and the Internet. Students should encode and decode messages using a variety of encryption methods, and they should understand the different levels of complexity used to hide or secure information. For example, students could secure messages using methods such as Caesar cyphers or steganography (i.e., hiding messages inside a picture or other data). They can also model more complicated methods, such as public key encryption, through unplugged activities.</li>
				<li><strong>2-DA-07: Represent data using multiple encoding schemes.</strong> Data representations occur at multiple levels of abstraction, from the physical storage of bits to the arrangement of information into organized formats (e.g., tables). Students should represent the same data in multiple ways. For example, students could represent the same color using binary, RGB values, hex codes (low-level representations), as well as forms understandable by people, including words, symbols, and digital displays of the color (high-level representations).</li>
