		<h2>Lab 3: Make Some Noise</h2>
		<p>
			This lab covers the basics of visualizing and generating sound waves. Students first create an oscilloscope (first image below) to graph <strong>sound intensity over <em>time</em></strong> for data picked up by the computer microphone. They then build a spectrum analyzer (second image below) which graphs the <strong>sound intensity of each <em>frequency</em></strong>.

		</p>
		<p>Students then create their own sounds first by generating and playing a set of random intensity values to make white noise, then by <em>repeating</em> a short set of random intensity values to make a note (where  pitch depends on the set length, which controls the frequency with which the set repeats); and finally (if there is time) by repeating a short set of <em>specific</em> intensity values to make an instrument.</p>

						<li>This lab is all about sound. Each pair of students will need a computer with a microphone for the first 4 lab activities. (Speakers and/or headphones are not needed until Activity 5.</li>
						<li>
							Before you work on this lab with students, <strong>work through the first two pages of the lab yourself</strong> to check your microphone and familiarize yourself project. You may also want to load your Snap<em>!</em> project on a student computer and to test out the microphone on a student machine.

					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>

									<li>Check system settings to see that the microphone works with the computer.</li>

						<li>
							Unplugged Introduction:
							In order to clarify the axes of an oscilloscope plot, do this quick unplugged activity where you graph volume intensity over time on the board:
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Make a plot based on a sound.</strong> Draw a coordinate axis on the board with "intensity" as the label on the vertical axis and "time" as the label on the horizontal axis. Have one person (a student or you) sing a pitch (or just say a vowel for a long time: "oooooooooo") and vary the volume (quiet, loud, medium, etc.). As the volume varies, plot the intensity over time. (That is, while moving the pen from left to right across the board, move the pen higher when the sound is louder and lower when the sound is quieter.)</li>
								<li><strong>Make sound based on a plot.</strong> Then do the opposite: draw and label a new axis ("intensity" over "time"), and ask a student (or the class) to sing (or say a vowel) at the volume level you are indicating on a new graph. Start with your pen at the middle of the vertical-axis, and while moving the pen from left to right, draw the line higher or lower to indicate the volume at which they should vocalize.  </li>
							</ul>
							This will help students understand what an oscilloscope shows and also helps to distinguish "higher and lower volume" from "higher and lower frequency" which will become relevant in the next activity. (5&ndash;10 minutes)
						</li>
						<li>Writing Code to Draw One Set of Samples: Students create a global variable to store the width that each sample gets on the stage, create the <code>for each</code> code that will move the sprite to the correct place on the Snap<em>!</em> stage for each volume sample, and discuss how the <code>for each</code> code works. The <code>for each</code> block is the core of the code for this algorithm, and specific changes to this code make the difference between an oscilloscope and a spectrum analyzer, as students will see in the next activity. After students have had a chance to discuss with their partner how the <code>for each</code> code will work, you may opt to facilitate a similar discussion with the whole class. (10&ndash;30 minutes)</li>
						<li>Drawing Microphone Samples Continuously: Students build out the rest of the project, troubleshoot any issues with their code, and add comments to help them remember how their code works. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Extensions: Students conduct some simple experiments with the vertical scaling factor. (about 5 minutes)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>If the oscilloscope doesn't appear nicely on the Snap<em>!</em> stage, check that the vertical scale factor (the 150 multiplier in the <em>y</em> input to the <code>goto</code> block) is an appropriate value to make the oscilloscope's oscillations both be visible and fit within the Snap<em>!</em> stage (the idea scale value may be vary across devices).</li>

						<li>Reading about spectrum analysis and exploring the <code>microphone</code> block: Students learn the difference between an oscilloscope and a spectrum analyzer and explore the <var>spectrum</var> input to the <code>microphone</code> block. (5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>

You may wish to wrap up class with a discussion of these changes to ensure that all students successfully updated their code and understand how it works. (10&ndash;30 minutes)</li>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-CS-02: Design projects that combine hardware and software components to collect and exchange data.</strong> Collecting and exchanging data involves input, output, storage, and processing. When possible, students should select the hardware and software components for their project designs by considering factors such as functionality, cost, size, speed, accessibility, and aesthetics. For example, components for a mobile app could include accelerometer, GPS, and speech recognition. The choice of a device that connects wirelessly through a Bluetooth connection versus a physical USB connection involves a tradeoff between mobility and the need for an additional power source for the wireless device.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-11: Create clearly named variables that represent different data types and perform operations on their values. </strong> A variable is like a container with a name, in which the contents may change, but the name (identifier) does not. When planning and developing programs, students should decide when and how to declare and name new variables. Students should use naming conventions to improve program readability. Examples of operations include adding points to the score, combining user input with words to make a sentence, changing the size of a picture, or adding a name to a list of people.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-12: Design and iteratively develop programs that combine control structures, including nested loops and compound conditionals.</strong> Collecting and exchanging data involves input, output, storage, and processing.

				<li><strong>2-AP-19: Document programs in order to make them easier to follow, test, and debug.</strong> Documentation allows creators and others to more easily use and understand a program. Students should provide documentation for end users that explains their artifacts and how they function. For example, students could provide a project overview and clear user instructions. They should also incorporate comments in their product and communicate their process using design documents, flowcharts, and presentations.</li>
