		<h2>Lab 3: Make Some Noise</h2>
		<p>
			<div class="todo">Finish after finishing labs</div>
			This lab covers the basics of visualizing and generating waveforms. In the first activity, students create an oscilloscope (example shown below) to graph sound intensity over <em>time</em> for data picked up by their computer microphone. In the second activity, they build a spectrum analyzer which graphs the intensity of each <em>frequency</em>.

The first 2:32 covers the difference between oscilloscopes and spectrum amalyzers. You can skip the next section called "Sine Wave Mathematical Formula," if you aren't interested in the math. The rest of this 9-minute video covers the basic waveforms: sine, square, triangular, sawtooth, ramp.</li>

		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-CS-02: Design projects that combine hardware and software components to collect and exchange data.</strong> Collecting and exchanging data involves input, output, storage, and processing. When possible, students should select the hardware and software components for their project designs by considering factors such as functionality, cost, size, speed, accessibility, and aesthetics. For example, components for a mobile app could include accelerometer, GPS, and speech recognition. The choice of a device that connects wirelessly through a Bluetooth connection versus a physical USB connection involves a tradeoff between mobility and the need for an additional power source for the wireless device.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-11: Create clearly named variables that represent different data types and perform operations on their values. </strong> A variable is like a container with a name, in which the contents may change, but the name (identifier) does not. When planning and developing programs, students should decide when and how to declare and name new variables. Students should use naming conventions to improve program readability. Examples of operations include adding points to the score, combining user input with words to make a sentence, changing the size of a picture, or adding a name to a list of people.</li>
