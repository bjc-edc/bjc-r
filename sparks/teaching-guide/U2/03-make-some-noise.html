		<h2>Lab 3: Make Some Noise</h2>
		<p>
			This lab covers the basics of visualizing and generating sound waves. Students first create an oscilloscope (first example below) to graph <strong>sound intensity over <em>time</em></strong> for data picked up by the computer microphone. They then build a spectrum analyzer (second example below) which graphs the <strong>sound intensity of each <em>frequency</em></strong>.

		</p>
		<p>Students then create their own sounds first by generating and playing a set of random intensity values to make white noise, then by <em>repeating</em> a short set of random intensity values to make a note (where  pitch depends on the set length, which controls the frequency with which the set repeats); and finally (if there is time) by repeating a short set of <em>specific</em> intensity values to make an instrument.</p>

						<li>This lab is all about sound. Each pair of students will need a computer with a microphone for the first 4 lab actives. (Speakers and/or headphones are not needed until Activity 5.</li>
						<div class="sidenoteBig">You can right-click the <code>microphone</code> block and choose "help..." to learn more about how the  Snap<em>!</em> <code>microphone</code> block works.</div>
						<li>
							Before you work on this lab with students, try the <strong>work through the first two pages of the lab yourself</strong> to check your microphone and familiarize yourself project. You may also want to load your Snap<em>!</em>project on a student computer and to test out the microphone.

								<strong><h4>Trouble-shooting Microphone Issues</h4>
								</strong>
								Your students may be better at troubleshooting microphone issues than you are. If you have issues, here are some things to try: 
								<ul>
									<li>For external microphones, check the connection of microphone to the computer</li>
									<li>Check system settings to see that the microphone works with the computer</li>
									<li>Check the browser settings to see that the microphone works with the browser</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>In order to clarify the axes of an oscilloscope plot, you may want to do a<strong> quick unplugged activity</strong> where you graph volume intensity over time on the board. Draw a coordinate axes on the board with "intensity" as the label on the vertical axis and "time" as the label on the horizontal axis. Have one person (a student or you) sing a pitch (or just say a vowel for a long time: "oooooooooo") and vary the volume. As the volume varies, draw a plot of volume intensity over time. (That is, while moving the writing implement from left to right at a constant speed across the board, draw the line higher when the sound is louder and lower when the sound is quieter.) Then, do the opposite: ask a student (or the class) to sing (or say a vowel) at the volume level you draw on a new graph. Start with your pen at the middle of the vertical-axis and while moving it from left to right, draw the line higher and lower to indicate the volume at which they should vocalize. This will help students understand what an oscilloscope shows and also helps to distinguish "higher and lower volume" from "higher and lower frequency" which will become relevant in the next activity. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Review creating and using global variables.</li>
						<li>Review list traversal with the <code>for each</code> block.</li>
						<li>Use the  Snap<em>!</em> drawing tools to visualize data.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Writing Code to Draw One Set of Samples: Students create a global variable to store the amount of space each sample gets on the stage, create the <code>for each</code> code that will move the sprite to the correct place on the Snap<em>!</em> stage for each volume sample, and discuss how the <code>for each</code> code works. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Drawing Microphone Samples Continuously: Students build out the rest of the project, troubleshoot any issues with their code, and add comments to help them remember how their code works. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Extensions: Students conduct some simple experiments with the vertical scaling factor. (about 5 minutes)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>The <code>for each</code> block is the core of the code for this algorithm, and specific changes to this code make the difference between an oscilloscope and a spectrum analyzer as students will see in the next activity. You may wish to take extra time to discuss how this code works as a class.</li>

					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>

						<li>Reading about spectrum analysis and exploring the <code>microphone</code> block: Students learn the difference between an oscilloscope and a spectrum analyzer and explore the <var>spectrum</var> input to the <code>microphone</code> block. (5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>
						<li>Re-purposing the code from <code>show volume samples</code> to create a new <code>show frequencies</code> block: Students modify the inputs to the <code>for each</code> block and of the <code>go to</code> block inside it to make their program draw a intensity-over-frequency plot rather than an intensity-over-time plot as they did previously. You may wish to wrap up class with a discussion of these changes to ensure that all students successfully updated their code and understand how it works. (10&ndash;20 minutes)</li>

				<li><strong>2-CS-02: Design projects that combine hardware and software components to collect and exchange data.</strong> Collecting and exchanging data involves input, output, storage, and processing. When possible, students should select the hardware and software components for their project designs by considering factors such as functionality, cost, size, speed, accessibility, and aesthetics. For example, components for a mobile app could include accelerometer, GPS, and speech recognition. The choice of a device that connects wirelessly through a Bluetooth connection versus a physical USB connection involves a tradeoff between mobility and the need for an additional power source for the wireless device.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-11: Create clearly named variables that represent different data types and perform operations on their values. </strong> A variable is like a container with a name, in which the contents may change, but the name (identifier) does not. When planning and developing programs, students should decide when and how to declare and name new variables. Students should use naming conventions to improve program readability. Examples of operations include adding points to the score, combining user input with words to make a sentence, changing the size of a picture, or adding a name to a list of people.</li>
