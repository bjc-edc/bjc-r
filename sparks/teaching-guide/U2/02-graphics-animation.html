		<h2>Lab 2: Graphics and Animation</h2>
		<p>After exploring song writing as an introduction to sequencing and looping commands, students explore the graphical aspects of  Snap<em>!</em> programing, including sprite movement and costumes as well as events such as clicking a sprite or a specific area on the  Snap<em>!</em>. stage. One goal is for students to create a fun and/or useful object of their own design such as an animated greeting card to share with others or an interactive poster for a presentation topic in another class. Another goal is for students to consider the user experience and solicit feedback before and after coding the project.</p> 
		<div class="endnote">
			<p>This lab laid out differently than previous labs. In response to teacher requests for shorter lab pages and more opportunities for differentiation, Unit 2 Lab 2 offers a new design with a greater number of shorter lab pages, some of which are entirely optional. To further shorten the appearance of the student-facing pages (both to present more manageable-looking content, but also to facilitate navigation), more of the text has been hidden behind links that open additional information available on the page.</p>
			<p>As a teacher, you may choose to include some of the supplemental pages or to skip some suggested pages (details on how to decide below) to adjust for the time you have available. Additionally, this Teacher Guide page has been set up differently to allow you to view the teacher-facing content for each student page one page at a time in a more focused format rather than by scrolling through a long list. Please provide us with your feedback on this new model as we consider whether to design and redesign other BJC Sparks labs with these formatting changes.</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Prepare:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>You may wish to review the contents of this lab&mdash;particularly the list of "New Snap<em>!</em> Skills" on this page&mdash;and decide ahead of time whether your class will cover (and hence should design a project plan for) each of the new skills. Each skill listed on this activity page aligns with a single later activity in this lab.</li>
						<li>Prepare to share the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mlbSvkS0-Q79WgHw7k0IaWsKEpLvMNHLs98VobeM438/copy" title="Activity 1: Planning Your Interactive Project worksheet" target="_blank">Planning Your Interactive Project</a> worksheet with students (e.g., print it, add it to your learning management system, etc.). If you plan to cover only a subset of the activities in this lab, you may wish to modify the worksheet before posting.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Understand the new skills they will learn in this lab.</li>
						<li>Plan an interactive project that uses each of these new skills.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>New Snap<em>!</em> Skills: Students learn about the kinds of animation-related features they will be learning to use in their project. (5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>
						<li>Making Your Plan: Students decide on the purpose of the interactive project they will create and decide how they will use each of the new skills they will develop of the course of this lab. (15&ndash;30 minutes)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>You might choose to review one or more of the example interactive projects together and to discuss how they use each of the new Snap<em>!</em> skills students will be learning.</li>
						<li>Students do not need to stick to their design plan perfectly. As they develop their project in Snap<em>!</em>, their design may change; this is normal for any creative endeavor. The purpose of creating a plan is so that they design a project with some overall coherence rather than one with a bunch of random features.</li>
						<li>Look out for any students having trouble understanding the new features they will be learning about. It's not possible to design for a feature you don't understand. Discuss these upcoming skills as needed.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Standards:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>2-AP-12:</strong> Design and iteratively develop programs that combine control structures, including nested loops and compound conditionals.</li>

						<li>Print or post copies of the <a href="/copy" title="Activity 8: Testing and Improving Your Interactive Project worksheet" target="_blank">Testing and Improving Your Interactive Project</a> worksheet.</li>
						<li>Decide how you want to run the testing and feedback sessions. How many users will student's observe using their project? Will you assign the users/testers to each programmer, or will they self-organize? Will some of the testing and feedback sessions occur outside the classroom as homework (such as with family or friends)?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Consider the user's experience of the final project <em>without programmer support</em>.</li>
						<li>Identify potential project improvements, and select and implement one or more that offer the greatest potential for improvement to the user experience within the constraints of time and programming ability.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Soliciting Feedback (20-60 minutes total): Each student should work with 2-3 users to evaluate their project. For each user, they should
							<ul>
								<li>Share the project (5-10 minutes per user): Students share their project with 2-3 people and watch them use it <em>without any support</em>. Programmers will want to tell their users how to use program, but they must resist this urge in order to observe an authentic user experience.</li>
								<li>Interview the users (5-10 minutes per user): After each unassisted user experience, students should gather feedback from the users. During this phase, the user can ask questions, the programmer can answer them, and the two can look at the Snap<em>!</em> project together.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Reflection (5-10 minutes): The programmer should reflect on the observed user experience and the user's feedback, and they should plan potential project improvements.</li>
						<li>Improvements (20-40 minutes): Students should have time to make at least one improvement (balancing the amount of potential improvement to the user experience with the time and technical demands of the change). As always, not all potential improvements will be possible with the time available and student's current skill-level.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>You may wish to wrap up the lab with a class discussion about the importance of soliciting and incorporating user feedback in the development process. You might ask students to describe a time when they wish that the software they were using was developed differently and how they dealt with it (keep using it despite the problem, contacted technical support, used a different project, etc.) or to share some of their feedback or observations about their own project and the improvement they made (or plan to make) in response.</li>

		<h3>Correlation with CSTA Standards<a name="Standards" class="anchor">&nbsp;</a></h3>
		<div class="Standards">
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2-AP-12: Design and iteratively develop programs that combine control structures, including nested loops and compound conditionals.</strong> Control structures can be combined in many ways. Nested loops are loops placed within loops. Compound conditionals combine two or more conditions in a logical relationship (e.g., using AND, OR, and NOT), and nesting conditionals within one another allows the result of one conditional to lead to another. For example, when programming an interactive story, students could use a compound conditional within a loop to unlock a door only if a character has a key AND is touching the door.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-13: Decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs.</strong> Students should break down problems into subproblems, which can be further broken down to smaller parts. Decomposition facilitates aspects of program development by allowing students to focus on one piece at a time (e.g., getting input from the user, processing the data, and displaying the result to the user). Decomposition also enables different students to work on different parts at the same time. For example, animations can be decomposed into multiple scenes, which can be developed independently.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-14: Create procedures with parameters to organize code and make it easier to reuse.</strong> Students should create procedures and/or functions that are used multiple times within a program to repeat groups of instructions. These procedures can be generalized by defining parameters that create different outputs for a wide range of inputs. For example, a procedure to draw a circle involves many instructions, but all of them can be invoked with one instruction, such as “drawCircle.” By adding a radius parameter, the user can easily draw circles of different sizes.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-15: Seek and incorporate feedback from team members and users to refine a solution that meets user needs.</strong> Development teams that employ user-centered design create solutions (e.g., programs and devices) that can have a large societal impact, such as an app that allows people with speech difficulties to translate hard-to-understand pronunciation into understandable language. Students should begin to seek diverse perspectives throughout the design process to improve their computational artifacts. Considerations of the end-user may include usability, accessibility, age-appropriate content, respectful language, user perspective, pronoun use, color contrast, and ease of use. </li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-16: Incorporate existing code, media, and libraries into original programs, and give attribution.</strong> Building on the work of others enables students to produce more interesting and powerful creations. Students should use portions of code, algorithms, and/or digital media in their own programs and websites. At this level, they may also import libraries and connect to web application program interfaces (APIs). For example, when creating a side-scrolling game, students may incorporate portions of code that create a realistic jump movement from another person's game, and they may also import Creative Commons-licensed images to use in the background. Students should give attribution to the original creators to acknowledge their contributions.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-19: Document programs in order to make them easier to follow, test, and debug.</strong> Documentation allows creators and others to more easily use and understand a program. Students should provide documentation for end users that explains their artifacts and how they function. For example, students could provide a project overview and clear user instructions. They should also incorporate comments in their product and communicate their process using design documents, flowcharts, and presentations.</li>
