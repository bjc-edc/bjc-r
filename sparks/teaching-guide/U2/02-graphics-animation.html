		<h2>Lab 2: Graphics and Animation</h2>
		<div class="todo">I moved the "Learning Goals" section before "Prepare" so that teachers know what they are preparing for. Need to go back and do this to prior labs. --MF, 10/23/23</div>

		<p>After experimenting with song writing as an introduction to sequencing and looping commands, students explore the graphical aspects of  Snap<em>!</em> programing, including sprite movement and costumes as well as events such as clicking a sprite or a specific area on the  Snap<em>!</em>. stage. One goal is for students to create a fun and/or useful object of their own design such as an animated greeting card to share with others or an interactive poster for a presentation topic in another class. Another goal is for students to consider the user experience and solicit feedback before and after coding the project.</p>

		<div class="endnote">
			<p>In response to teacher requests for shorter lab pages and more opportunities for differentiation, Unit 2 Lab 2 offers a greater number of shorter lab pages, some of which are entirely optional. To further shorten the appearance of the student-facing pages (both to present more manageable-looking content and to facilitate navigation), more of the text has been hidden behind links that open additional information available on the page.</p>
			<p>As the teacher, you may choose which of these optional pages to include (suggestions on how to decide below) based on your teaching context. Please provide us with your feedback on this new model as we consider whether to design/redesign other BJC Sparks labs with these formatting changes.</p>

					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>New Snap<em>!</em> Skills: Students read about the  animation-related features they will be creating in their project. (5&ndash;10 minutes)</li>
						<li>Making Your Plan: Students decide on the purpose of the interactive project they will create and decide how their project will demonstrate each of the new skills they will cultivate. (25&ndash;50 minutes)</li>

					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<div class="todo">We don't have a comprehensive enough example project yet. <li>You might choose to review one or more of the example interactive projects together and to discuss how they use each of the new Snap<em>!</em> skills students will be learning.</li></div>
						<li>Students do not need to stick to their design plan perfectly. As they develop their project in Snap<em>!</em>, their design may change; this is normal for any creative endeavor. The purpose of creating a plan is so that they design a project with some overall coherence and that supports the building of specific new skills.</li>
						<li>Look out for any students having trouble understanding the functionality of new features they will be learning about throughout the lab. It's hard to design for a feature you don't understand. Discuss and/or demonstrate these upcoming skills as needed.</li>

In particular, review the "Ways to Figure Out Snap<em>!</em> Coordinates" section on this page, the text around the example predicate (shown below) in Activity 13 before the first exercise, and the text about messages (shown right) in Activity 14 before the first exercise.

						<li>You may wish to plan a demonstration of the  Snap<em>!</em> coordinate system and/or the "Ways to Figure Out Snap<em>!</em> Coordinates" described on the student activity page before students identify the coordinates of the rectangle(s) they want to define their click area(s).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Students review their project plan, decide which rectangular area(s) will respond to user clicks, and determine the coordinates of the corners of each click area. (10&ndash;30 minutes)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>The "Ways to Figure Out Snap! Coordinates" section on this page presents several strategies for determining the coordinates of the rectangular area(s) that will be responsive to user clicks. These methods are not mutually exclusive, and sometimes a combination of methods can be useful.</li>
						<li>Students may ask why click areas have to be rectangular. They don't have to be rectangular, but because rectangles (that are at right angles with the coordinate system) have only two <em>x</em>-coordinates and two <em>y</em>-coordinates, they are much easier to encode than other shapes. If students have extra time after finishing the basic requirements of this lab, they can explore using non-rectangular click areas by writing more complicated predicates. There is an activity about matching predicates to the results of running them through a specific drawing script that may give you or your students ideas about how to encode diagonal or curved lines with predicates on <a href="http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/4-boolean-experiments.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="BJC AP CSP Unit 2 Lab 3 Page 4: Boolean Expression Experiments"  target="_blank">page 2.3.4</a> of the AP Computer Science Principles BJC course, but do note that some translation from that project, which has different goals, will be required.</li>

					<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>

						<li>
							Soliciting Feedback (20-60 minutes total): Each student should work with 2-3 users to evaluate their project. For each user, they should
							<ul>
								<li>Share the project (5-10 minutes per user): Students share their project with 2-3 people and watch them use it <em>without any support</em>. Programmers will want to tell their users how to use program, but they must resist this urge in order to observe an authentic user experience.</li>
								<li>Interview the users (5-10 minutes per user): After each unassisted user experience, students should gather feedback from the users. During this phase, the user can ask questions, the programmer can answer them, and the two can look at the Snap<em>!</em> project together.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Reflection (5-10 minutes): The programmer should reflect on the observed user experience and the user's feedback, and they should plan potential project improvements.</li>
						<li>Improvements (20-40 minutes): Students should have time to make at least one improvement (balancing the amount of potential improvement to the user experience with the time and technical demands of the change).

			<ul>
				<!--<li><strong>2-AP-12: Design and iteratively develop programs that combine control structures, including nested loops and compound conditionals.</strong> Control structures can be combined in many ways. Nested loops are loops placed within loops. Compound conditionals combine two or more conditions in a logical relationship (e.g., using AND, OR, and NOT), and nesting conditionals within one another allows the result of one conditional to lead to another. For example, when programming an interactive story, students could use a compound conditional within a loop to unlock a door only if a character has a key AND is touching the door.</li>-->
				<li><strong>2-AP-13: Decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs.</strong> Students should break down problems into subproblems, which can be further broken down to smaller parts. Decomposition facilitates aspects of program development by allowing students to focus on one piece at a time (e.g., getting input from the user, processing the data, and displaying the result to the user). Decomposition also enables different students to work on different parts at the same time. For example, animations can be decomposed into multiple scenes, which can be developed independently.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-15: Seek and incorporate feedback from team members and users to refine a solution that meets user needs.</strong> Development teams that employ user-centered design create solutions (e.g., programs and devices) that can have a large societal impact, such as an app that allows people with speech difficulties to translate hard-to-understand pronunciation into understandable language. Students should begin to seek diverse perspectives throughout the design process to improve their computational artifacts. Considerations of the end-user may include usability, accessibility, age-appropriate content, respectful language, user perspective, pronoun use, color contrast, and ease of use. </li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-16: Incorporate existing code, media, and libraries into original programs, and give attribution.</strong> Building on the work of others enables students to produce more interesting and powerful creations. Students should use portions of code, algorithms, and/or digital media in their own programs and websites. At this level, they may also import libraries and connect to web application program interfaces (APIs). For example, when creating a side-scrolling game, students may incorporate portions of code that create a realistic jump movement from another person's game, and they may also import Creative Commons-licensed images to use in the background. Students should give attribution to the original creators to acknowledge their contributions.</li>
				<li><strong>2-AP-19: Document programs in order to make them easier to follow, test, and debug.</strong> Documentation allows creators and others to more easily use and understand a program. Students should provide documentation for end users that explains their artifacts and how they function. For example, students could provide a project overview and clear user instructions. They should also incorporate comments in their product and communicate their process using design documents, flowcharts, and presentations.</li>
