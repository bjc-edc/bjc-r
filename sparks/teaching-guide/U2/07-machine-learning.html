Lesson Plan
●	[8 min] Intro, make predictions, put post-it notes on wall and compare
●	[30 min] Get data with hula hoop activity
●	[10 minutes] Digitize the data
●	[5 minutes] Build the model
●	[5 minutes] Visualize
●	[10 minutes] Test the model (compare with classmates or whole class, discuss what's a reasonable error, decide whether any data needs to be re-collected)
●	[15 minutes] Make predictions (compare to post-its, discuss the questions)
Standards

2-DA-09	Refine computational models based on the data they have generated.
A model may be a programmed simulation of events or a representation of how various data is related. In order to refine a model, students need to consider which data points are relevant, how data points relate to each other, and if the data is accurate. For example, students may make a prediction about how far a ball will travel based on a table of data related to the height and angle of a track. The students could then test and refine their model by comparing predicted versus actual results and considering whether other factors are relevant (e.g., size and mass of the ball). Additionally, students could refine game mechanics based on test outcomes in order to make the game more balanced or fair.
Practice(s): Creating Computational Artifacts, Developing and Using Abstractions: 5.3, 4.4

2-AP-11	Create clearly named variables that represent different data types and perform operations on their values.
A variable is like a container with a name, in which the contents may change, but the name (identifier) does not. When planning and developing programs, students should decide when and how to declare and name new variables. Students should use naming conventions to improve program readability. Examples of operations include adding points to the score, combining user input with words to make a sentence, changing the size of a picture, or adding a name to a list of people.
Practice(s): Creating Computational Artifacts: 5.1, 5.2
