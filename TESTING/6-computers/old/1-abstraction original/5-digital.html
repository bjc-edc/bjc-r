		<title>Unit 6 Lab 1: Computer Abstraction Hierarchy, Page 5</title>
	</head>
<body>
    <div class="todo">
Why this?  This page is about the four levels of abstraction between the program abstraction and the digital abstraction, from the chart on page 1.
<p>Why here?  There will be three pages, including this one, about the parts of the abstraction hierarchy separated by the two major abstraction barriers, going from top to bottom.</p>
<p>2.2.3F A logic gate is a hardware abstraction that is modeled by a Boolean function.<br />
2.2.3G A chip is an abstraction composed of low level components and circuits that perform a specific function<br />
5.2.1F Processes use memory, a central processing unit (CPU), and input and output.
</p>

<H2>The Digital Domain</H2>

<p>We now move to the levels of abstraction between the program abstraction and the digital abstraction: architecture, components, chips, and logic gates.</p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>

<p>What's an architecture? It's an abstraction that specifies the machine language, the instructions that the hardware will understand; it tells how the processor connects to the memory; but it doesn't include actual circuitry, which comes at a lower level of abstraction.</p>
<p>For example, most computer processors (the part that carries out instructions) in desktop or laptop computers use an architecture designed at Intel, a chip manufacturer, called &quot;x86.&quot; The first processor using that architecture was called the 8086, released in 1978. Since then, there have been many refinements of the architecture, but they're almost always <em>backward compatible,</em> meaning that a program written for the 8086 will still run on today's versions of x86.</p>
<p>One important part of an architecture is the number of wires that run in parallel between the processor and the memory. This is called the <em>width</em> of the architecture, measured in <em>bits.</em> The original 8086 was a 16-bit architecture; since then 32-bit (since 1985) and 64-bit (since 2003) versions have been developed.</p>

<h4>The memory hierarchy</h4>
<p>For a given level of circuit hardware, <strong>the bigger the memory, the slower it works.</strong> For this reason, computers don't just have one big chunk of memory. There will be a small number of <em>registers</em> inside the processor itself: between 8 and 16 of them in x86 computers. The size of a register is generally equal to the width of the architecture.</p>
<p>The computer's main memory, these days, is measured in GB (gigabytes, or billions of bytes). A memory of that size can't be fast enough to keep up with a modern processor. Luckily, computer programs generally have <em>locality of reference,</em> which means that if the program has just made use of a particular memory location, it's probably going to use a nearby location next. So a complete program may be very big, but only a small part of it will be needed over the course of a second or so. Therefore, between the processor and the memory will be one or more <em>cache</em> memories, much smaller than the main memory, and therefore faster. The processor makes sure that the most recently used memory is copied into the cache. One recent 64-bit x86 processor has a first level (L1) cache of 64KB (thousands of bytes) inside the processor chip, a larger but slower L2 cache of 256 KB, also inside the processor, and an L3 cache of up to 2 MB (megabytes, millions of bytes) outside the processor. Each level of cache has a copy of the most recently used parts of the next level outward: the L1 cache copies part of the L2 cache, which copies part of the L3 cache, which copies part of the main memory. Data in the L1 cache can be accessed by the processor about as fast as its internal registers, and each level outward is a little slower.</p>

<h4>Second sourcing</h4>

<p>Intel licenses other chip manufacturers to build processors that use the same architecture as Intel's processors. Why do they do that? Wouldn't they make more money if people had to buy from Intel? The reason is that computer manufacturers, such as Dell, Apple, and Lenovo, won't build their systems around an architecture that is only available from one company. They're not worried that Intel will go out of business; the worry is that there may be a larger-than-expected demand for a particular processor, and Intel may not be able to fill orders on time. But if that processor is also available from other companies such as AMD and Cyrix, then a delay at Intel won't turn into a delay at Dell. Those other chip manufacturers may not use the same circuitry as the Intel version, as long as they behave the same at the architecture level.</p>

<h3>Components</h3>

<p>For as long as people have been teaching other people about computers, one thing they always say is &quot;A computer consists of the processor, memory, and input/output devices.&quot; </p>
<p>In the early days of computers, it was easy to point out the huge racks of equipment that contained each of those three components:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/pdp-10.jpg" alt="PDP-10"></p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/pdp-10-disks.jpg" alt="PDP-10 I/O"></p>

<p>These are pictures of the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 computer, from the 1970s. Each of the big racks full of circuitry is about the size of a refrigerator.  Today, a processor takes up a square about 1Â½ inches on a side, <em>including</em> two levels of cache memory.  The full main memory today will occupy one or two rectangular circuit boards about 1 inch by 3 inches.</p>
<p>Even though they're harder to see today, the processor and memory are still the most important things to understand in an architecture. But the visible parts of a computer are also important:

<h3>Integrated Circuits</h3>
<p>The fundamental enabling technology for the computer age was the <em>transistor.</em> A transistor is an amplifier: A small change in its input causes a bigger change in its output. But in computer circuits, transistors are used as remote-control switches: The input either does or doesn't have voltage coming in, and the output does the same, but at higher power, similar to the way a light switch on the wall can control a high-power light bulb in the ceiling. We'll revisit how transistors function on the next page.</p>
<p>The transistor was invented in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Laboratories, also the home of Unix.  The inventors were awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.</p>
<p>At first, each transistor was in a separate plastic package. Here's a picture of a circuit made with discrete (separate) transistors:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/discrete-transistor-adder.jpg" alt="discrete transistor circuit"><br />
<small>Photo and circuit construction by Simon Inns.  License: CC-BY-SA.  Downloaded from http://www.waitingforfriday.com.</small></p>
<p>In this picture, the transistors are the black, D-shaped parts. The brown more-or-less cylindrical parts are <em>resistors,</em> a much simpler component that has been around about as long as electricity. The dark lines you can see through the circuit board are wires, printed onto the board. If your classroom printer had liquid silver ink, it could make circuit boards like this. All the components (transistors and resistors) are on the front of the board. The wires from these components (one at each end of a resistor, three close together on the flat side of a transistor) go through the board, where they are soldered (a kind of hot metallic glue) to the circuit board's wiring. A few wires are on the front side of the board, because otherwise the circuit couldn't be made without printed wires crossing each other.</p>
<p>The IBM 7090, developed in 1959, was built out of discrete transistors â over 50,000 of them. As you can imagine, this machine was large and expensive: about three million dollars, equivalent to over $55 million today. In those days, almost everyone thought that computers would be used only by large corporations or governments.</p>
<p>In order to have the modern computer age, in which many people carry extremely powerful computers in their pockets (their cell phones), circuits had to become much smaller and cheaper. The way this happened was through the invention of the <em>integrated circuit </em>(&quot;IC&quot; or &quot;chip&quot;). There wasn't a single definitive invention; the first relevant work was done in 1949, and techniques to fit components more closely in a chip are still being developed. But the Nobel Prize went to Jack Kilby, in 2000, for his 1958 demonstration of a working IC.</p>
<p>Early ICs could include only a few transistors. The circuit in the photo above could just about fit in one IC in the early 1960s, but progress was quick, and the first one-chip computer processor, the Intel 4004, was designed in 1969-1970. It had about 2300 transistors, and took up well under one square inch. It was called the &quot;4004&quot; because it had a four-bit bus architecture, so it wasn't very powerful as computers go. But progress was quick; the eight-bit Intel 8008, with 3500 transistors on the chip, came out in 1972. The Intel 8086, their first 16-bit-wide microprocessor, came out in 1978 and had about 20,000 transistors.  A variant version called the 8088 was used in the first IBM PC. The Motorola 68000, with 40,000 transistors, came out in 1979, and was used in several manufacturers' Unix workstations and in the early versions of the Apple Macintosh.</p>
<p>The largest processor chip in 2017, the AMC Epyc, has more than <em>19 billion</em> transistors!</p>

<h3>Logic Gates</h3>

<p>In a circuit with billions of transistors, or even thousands of transistors, hardware designers can't think about each individual transistor. Just as programmers use abstraction, hardware architects use abstractions, in which a group of transistors and other circuit elements are considered as a single thing. What kinds of things? There are basically two kinds, one for memory and one for computation.
<p>Memory is made out of <em>flip-flops.</em>
(They're officially called &quot;bistable multivibrators&quot; but you can see why nobody actually uses that name.) A flip-flop is a circuit that has two stable states, on and off. An input signal can tell it to change state, or to become on, or to become off.  Once that happens, the flip-flop stays in that state until it gets another signat. It has an output that reflects its state: on if the flip-flop is on, off if it's off.
<p>A flip-flop is generally made out of four transistors. A <em>register</em> in the processor is a group of flip-flops. If it's a 32-bit processor, a register is 32 flip-flops, and the same for other processor widths.
<p>The circuits to do computation are more interesting. They compute <em>functions,</em> just like reporters in Snap<em>!</em>. Since computers do a lot of arithmetic, you might think that the basic circuit functions would be addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but that's not the case. Of course there <em>are</em> circuits to do those things, but they're made out of <em>logic gates:</em> circuits that compute Boolean functions: <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>. The reason that Boolean functions are considered more fundamental is that their inputs and outputs can be represented with a single wire going into or out from the circuit.  That's not true about arithmetic functions.  If you consider a voltage on a wire as meaning 1, and no voltage as meaning 0, then you have to see that an adder will have <em>three</em> possible output values, because 1+1=2, which is neither 0 nor 1.  By contrast, if you consider a voltage on a wire as meaning True, and no voltage as meaning False, then the output from a Boolean function of two inputs can still only be True or False, so only one output wire is needed.
<p>In Lab 2 of this unit, you'll learn how numbers are represented using groups of wires, using <em>binary</em> representation.  In Lab 3, you'll learn how a handful of Boolean functions can be hooked up together, like composition of functions in Snap<em>!</em> programs, to make arithmetic circuits, such as an <em>adder,</em>
which computes the sum of two numbers.
