	<h2>Logic Gates: AND, OR, NOT </h2>
    
    <div class="learn"><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will catch a glimpse of how electronic circuitry can mimic Boolean operators and how elementary logic gates can be combined to manipulate and process binary digits to perform arithmetic tasks such as adding two numbers.  <strong>On this page,</strong> you will first explore the AND gate, OR gate and NOT gate.</strong></div><br />
    <p>Computers only deal with data in the form of the binary numbers 0 and 1 and you may wonder how they are able to execute their vast variety of complex tasks -involving thousands of decisions and computations- using only such simple numbers.  At the heart of digital electronics are elementary devices called <strong>logic gates</strong> which emulate Boolean functions you are already familiar with, such as : AND, OR and NOT.  Just as the inputs and outputs of Boolean functions are binary, False and True, the inputs and outputs of logic gates are also binary, 0 and 1, representing low and high voltage respectively.</p><br />
    
    <h3>AND gate:<img src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/LogicGates_img/Gates/AND.png" width="151" height="80" alt="AND-gate" title="AND-gate"/></h3>
    An AND gate is a logic gate that behaves exactly like the Boolean operator AND.  The output of the AND gate is 1 if and only if both of its inputs are 1, just as the output of the Boolean operator AND is True if and only if both of its inputs are True.  In the truth tables below you can see the correspondence between the Boolean operator AND and the AND gate.  In the tables, A and B represent the two binary inputs (False/True and 0/1) which are represented by the two wires going into the AND gate in the picture shown above.<br /><br />

    An OR gate is a logic gate that behaves exactly like the Boolean operator OR.  The output of the OR gate is 1 if and only if either or both of its inputs are 1, just as the output of the Boolean operator OR is True if and only if either or both of its inputs are True.  In the truth tables below you can see the correspondence between the Boolean operator OR and the OR gate.  In the tables, A and B represent the two binary inputs (False/True and 0/1) which are represented by the two wires going into the OR gate in the picture shown above.<br /><br />

                 <div class="sidenote">In daily human conversation the word "or" is often used with the implicit exclusive meaning "this or that, but <strong><em>not</em></strong> both" whereas in Boolean logic and computer circuitry "OR" always means the inclusive "this or that or both."</div>

   A NOT gate, also called an <em>inverter</em>, is a logic gate that behaves exactly like the Boolean operator NOT.  The output of the NOT gate is 1 if and only if its input is 0, just as the output of the Boolean operator NOT is True if and only if its input is False.  In the truth tables below you can see the correspondence between the Boolean operator NOT and the NOT gate.

    <p>The switch is basically a circuit breaker. If the switch is ON, the current flow is broken and the light bulb is OFF.
	If the switch is OFF, the current directly flows to the light bulb and then the light bulb is ON.</p>
