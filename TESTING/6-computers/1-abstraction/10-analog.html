        <p>You've learned that a wire can either have a voltage or not have a voltage on it. The reality is more complicated. The on-or-off picture of a wire, a transistor, or a logic gate output is a simplification&mdash;an abstraction. </p>

        <p>This is a rough graph of the actual input-output behavior of a transistor.  Don't worry about the details; just notice the two blue <em>flat</em> parts of the graph. <!--With a very small input (cutoff) or a very large input (saturation), the output is relatively unchanged by small variations.--> Within the "cutoff" region, small changes to the input voltage do not change the output voltage at all; the output is always <em>zero</em> volts. Likewise within the "saturation" region, small input changes hardly impact output voltage; the output is interpreted as a <em>one</em>. This is how transistors are used as <em>switches</em> in a computer.</p>
		<p>Transistors are versatile devices. When used in the middle, linear (pink) part of the graph, they're <em>amplifiers</em>; a small variation in input voltage produces a large variation in output voltage. That's how they're used to play music in a stereo. </p>

            <div id="hint-chart-labels" class="collapse">The lower region of the curve is called "cutoff" because the transistor's  output is <em>cut off</em> (the output is zero) for any input in that region. The  upper region is called "saturation" because, like a sponge that can't get any  wetter, the transistor can't give more output no matter how big the input. The  central region is called "linear" because it behaves like a linear (straight)  function.</div>

		<div class="endnote">The transistor was invented in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Laboratories, also the home of Unix. The inventors were awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.</div>

		<div class="takeNote">The digital domain is not a law of nature; circuit designers have to work at ensuring that each wire in a circuit is always either fully on or fully off.  The digital domain is an abstraction.</div>

            <div id="hint-digital-abstraction" class="collapse">
                <p>The flatness of the output at the two extremes is important because there <em>will</em> be small changes in the input. Electrical circuits have "noise," undesired changes in voltages, for reasons from the transistors getting hot to loose connections on the circuit board to cosmic rays. This is why computers use zeros and ones: a transistor has two flat regions in its input-output curve.</p>
                <p>But the flatness of the saturated region is only approximate, and it depends on how the transistor is connected to the rest of the circuit. One example of a potential problem is <em>fanout,</em> the number of transistor inputs to which one transistor's output is connected.  Beyond a certain number (it depends on the particular transistor type, but certainly ten inputs would be too many), the output voltage is reduced to the point that those inputs might not be sure whether they're getting a zero or a one.</p>
                <p>The way a transistor really works depends on quantum physics. (We're not talking about <em>quantum computers;</em> plain old computer circuits are based on quantum effects also.) To learn more about analog-domain circuit design and what's inside a transistor, take an Electrical Engineering course.</p>

                	Imagine the programs are running too slowly on your brand new, state of the art computer. At each of the following levels of abstraction, research what could be done to improve the speed (by you or by engineers):

    					<li>application software</li>
                        <li>programming language</li>

                    <li>Discussion: The If There Is Time problem on this page is about improving computer speed across several different levels of abstraction; it reviews and extends the ideas of the entire lab. This is a nice problem to have students discuss first in small groups and then together as a class. As students share their ideas with the class, you might ask <strong>"why hasn't someone already done this?"</strong>  of their various answers. Often, the answer is that people <em>have</em> done it; for example, running an older OS on newer hardware often <em>does</em> speed up the system, although it runs the risk of malware infection.  But sometimes, the answer is "it's hard, but they're trying."</li>
