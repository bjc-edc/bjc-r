	            <li>Describe the purpose of your program and the language that you used (Snap<em>!</em>, of course) to write it. (100 words or less)</li>
                <li>Describe how your project uses <em>abstraction</em>: (100 words or less)

                <li>Describe how you created your program step-by-step. What did you do first? Next? What challenges did you run into and how did you solve them? (100 words or less)</li>
