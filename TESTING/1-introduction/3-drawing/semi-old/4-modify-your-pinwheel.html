            <p>AC: They’ve experimented with the “second move” on the previous page. What’s new here is making the experiment programmatic by adding inputs. With a little surround, we could move directly to # 5. And is there a new idea in # 5?</p>

            <h4><strong>Debugging Tip: Organizing Your Code</strong></h4>
            <p>
                One way to avoid having bugs in your program in the first place is to keep your code organized by deleting any unused scripts.  You can use the <strong>clean up</strong> option by right-clicking (or control-clicking on a Mac) in the scripting area to organize your blocks.  You can <strong>remove a block or script</strong> either by dragging it out of the scripting area and back to the palettes on the left or by choosing the "delete" option from the drop-down menu. <a href="#hint-target" data-toggle="collapse" title="Click here for a video of cleaning up the scripting area and removing blocks.">Click here for a video</a>. (Note that this is different from the "delete block definition" option which will permanently delete a custom block and all its instances from your entire project.)<br />

                <ul>
                    <li>From Dan's work at San Mateo: U1.3.4.5 I really like how pinwheel is the generic block but you then ask them to make specific versions of "polygon" and "asterisk" based on inputs to pinwheel. Out of 15 groups, I probably saw 6 of them who, when asked to show their pinwheel block, had not "connected" all three inputs to their code below. That is, they hadn't dragged the input variables down, so the pinwheel was only responding to "number of turns". So there's something wrong there in that the task asks them to add "size" but nothing asks them to test it. <s>These kids also didn't connect "backup" so that means they must have skipped U1.3.4.7.</s> --MF, 9/5/17</li>
