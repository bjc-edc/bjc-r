                Teacher feedback from 2017-2018: 
                <ul>
                    <li>there were specific components that were challenging for students. A handful of teachers expressed the desire for more examples or variations, especially in relation to loops, including having students write their own loop, as well as the relationship between script variables and values of code. A few teachers mentioned that either their students had trouble with the directions or werenâ€™t reading the text carefully enough. Specific areas of struggle included loops, blocks with inputs, designing three inputs, always dragging an input inside each new custom block, feeling comfortable being creative and making mistakes, and building interest in creating scripts and utility scripts. </li>
                    <li>one teacher: "Page 3 Blocks with Inputs was especially challenging for the kids. They had a hard time understanding the relationship between the script variables and the values the user passed as parameters to the code. Perhaps before launching into this page where they have to understand the repeats and angle relationships, create some VERY basic examples. That being said, the kids LOVED making colorful designs. They were very proud of their creations. They spent a great deal of time exploring angle relationships and the images that were created. Page 6: The for loop needs more attention. There should be a number of examples showing how this works before students are asked to use it. The one say example was not enough to make them comfortable. They did enjoy making the spiral and squiral."</li>

In fact I might make a point of saying that when you're /teaching/ someone, you (we) put in comments that you wouldn't use if you were just programming for yourself.</p>
                        <p>But the hat block comment in the movie isn't very good documentation.  It should say "Draws a REGULAR five-sided polygon, with SIDE LENGTH set by the input."  (Not really capitalized; I just did that to emphasize to you what's missing.)</p>
                        <p>Really it's hard to give an example of useful commenting that doesn't look stupid unless you have a big project.
