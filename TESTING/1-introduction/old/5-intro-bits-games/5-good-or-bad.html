<div class="takeNote">Some of you will be the technology builders of the future.  All of you will be voters.  <em>You are not helpless in a world driven by technology!</em>  Instead of "technology is good" or "technology is bad," we hope you'll think, for each future technology, "how should this technology be designed and used to keep its benefits and still avoid its possible harms?"  <em>People</em> make the decisions that make a technology good or bad.</div>
