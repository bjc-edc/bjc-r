					It is useful to have a <code>max</code> block that takes two numbers as input and reports <img  src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/maxOfTwowithResult.png" height="40" alt=""/> whichever is bigger (the maximum).  Here is one way to define this block:<br />

				</li>
                <li>Similarly define a <code>min</code> block that takes two numbers as input and reports whichever is smaller (the minimum).

                <li>
                    Here is one way to define a block to find the maximum of three inputs <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/maxofThree.png"  height="30" alt=""/> :<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/maxofThreeCode.png"  height="116" alt=""/>
                    <div class="endnote">Notice that in the definition of three-input <code>max</code> we are using the two-input <code>max</code> <em>composed</em> with itself.  Using simpler blocks to define a more complicated block is an example of <em>abstraction</em> as this process hides complexity.  Using a block as an input for another block is an example of <em>composition</em>.</div>
                </li>
                <li>Similarly define <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/minofThree.png"  height="30" alt=""/> block that takes three numbers as input and reports whichever is the smallest (the minimum).</li>
                <li>
                    If we wanted to find the maximum of a list of numbers, <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/maxOfAList.png"  height="40" alt=""/>, we could define a reporter block that takes a list as an input and returns the largest element.  Here is one way to do this:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/maxOfAListCode.png" height="228" alt=""/>
                </li>
                <div class="endnote">Notice that <code>max of list</code> refers to itself in its definition. When a block refers to itself in its own definition, this definition is said to be <em>recursive</em>. The part of the code in a recursive definition that decides when the process terminates is called  the <em>base case</em>.  The part of the code in a recursive definition that calls on itself is called the <em>recursive case</em>.</div>
