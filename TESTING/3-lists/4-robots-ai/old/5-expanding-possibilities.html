        	<li><strong>JK: I don't have a place for this note from Brian</strong>: I'd like to say something, if we can make it understandable, about the way non-physical products (software, movies, etc.) distort the market for physical stuff (especially housing). People get rich on ideas, but you can't eat ideas, and the supply of real stuff isn't infinitely expandable, so in effect real stuff becomes more expensive for people not in the virtual-stuff business.</li>
