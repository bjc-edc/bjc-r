        	<ul>
				<li>GH Feedback 10/27/15: I do not understand the instructions on this page at all. This is the first lab all year where I am completely baffled by the instructions.</li>
                <li>Piazza Feedback 10/28/15: I cannot picture what the end product is supposed to look like after completed the part called "Improving Your Contact List App" Does anyone have a final product they could share with me so that I can see what we are shooting for? This is the first lesson I have encountered where I do not understand the instructions. Any help would be appreciated.</li>
                <li>There is too much text on this page. It needs to be cut down. --MF </li>
                <li>GH Feedback 11/30/15: The functionality of contact info is unclear. Does it report all the matching names, first and last, or only an exact match of the first or last name. etc.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 1/5/16: maybe provide a interactive example.</li>
                <li>GH Feedback 1/31/16: I don't feel that this page explains the need for constructor and selector blocks very well. I had to read through this several times before I could articulate why this method was not redundancy. If you add complexity to the contact, the constructor block WOULD have to be changed. So would the selector blocks so that they pull the right item from a contact. The only benefit to creating these blocks is if other programs were to use them. Instead of having to change the item number when selecting.... But I don't think you get that from this page....</li>

        <div class="todo">Brian's Notes from late July 2016:
        	<ul>
            	<li>I'm sad to say that everyone had trouble with my data abstraction stuff in the contact list app (3.2.4).  It's not that they couldn't do the individual steps, really; they just didn't understand how the steps were a story line.  The details that threw people are not understanding the difference between (GET PHONE) and (CONTACT PHONE) -- the first interacts with the user and the second is just a selector for contacts -- partly because the selector doesn't seem to do anything interesting enough to bother making a custom block for.  I think for 2016-17 we just flush that page, although then we have to decide whether what's left (in 3.2.1) is interestingly different from the grocery list app.  For 2017-18 one of you folks, who know how to write curriculum, should fix it.</li>
            </ul>

        	<p>3.2.1G Metadata is data about data.</p>
            <p>3.2.1H Metadata can be descriptive data about an image, a Web page, or other complex objects.</p>
            <p>3.2.1I Metadata can increase the effective use of data or data sets by providing additional information about various aspects of that data.</p>

                <li>Load your contact list app from before; it should be saved as "U3L2-ContactList"</li>
                <li>Real contact apps have a lot more information than just a name and a phone number.  Modify <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-new-contact.png" alt="get new contact"> so that each contact includes a name, <em>an address,</em> and a phone number, in that order.

    	<p>As we add more complexity to contacts&mdash;birthday, spouse, work address, and so on&mdash;the location of the phone number within a contact might keep changing. <em>This is where an abstract data type helps!</em> Instead of fixing every block that uses the phone number each time you move the phone number in the contact, you can define one <em>selector</em> block that knows where in the list the phone number is and use that in all other blocks that need to know.<!--  That way, a very small number of procedures will know the details of where things are, and only those will need editing when things change. Other parts of your program will use those special procedures and will keep working when the representation changes. --></p>
        
        
		<div class="ifTime">
        	<h4>Create the Abstract Data Type</h4>
			<ol start="5">
				<li>
                    To start, write a <em>constructor</em> block for the contact type that looks like this:<br />
					<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/contact-constructor.png" alt="contact name= () addr= () phone= ()"><br />
					It should report a contact (still a list of three items). 
              </li>
                <div class="endnote">Note that it takes the three items as inputs; it doesn't ask the user to enter the information. This block will be used in <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-new-contact.png" alt="get new contact">, but it doesn't do the entire job of <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-new-contact.png" alt="get new contact">.</div>
              <li>Rewrite  <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/get-new-contact.png" alt="get new contact"> to use this constructor.</li>
                <li>
                	Now write two new <em>selector</em> blocks. Each of them should take a contact as input and report the right piece of that contact.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/address-selector.png" alt="contact address ( )"><br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/phone-selector.png" alt="contact phone ( )"><br />
                	
                </li>
                <li>Also, check that the selectors you've already written still work, and fix them if needed.<br /> 
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-display.png" alt="name (display form) ()"><br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-sorting.png" alt="name (sorting form) ()"><br />
                    Together, the constructor and selectors define an <strong>abstract data type</strong>, in this case, the "contact" data type.
				</li>
          </ol>
    </div>
        
		<div class="ifTime">
			<h4>Rewrite the Lookup Blocks</h4>
            <ol start="9">
                <li>
                	Now you can rewrite the <code>phone number</code> block as shown below. You'll write the red <code>contact info</code> block using the definition from your old <code>phone number</code> block, except that instead of extracting the phone number, it should report the entire contact (a list).<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/phone-number-script.png" alt="report contact phone (contact info for (name))">
                </li>
                <li>Do the same thing for the <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-from-number.png" alt="name from number ()"> block. You'll need a red <code>contact info from number</code> block. Make sure this all works. </li>

        <!--<p>Later in this unit, you'll improve the contact app still further, to handle family-name-first names correctly.</p>-->
