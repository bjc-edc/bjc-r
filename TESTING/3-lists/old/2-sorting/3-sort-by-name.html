<h2>Sorting Contacts by Name</h2>
    <div class="learn">There's hardly anything you have to do <strong>on this page</strong>, but that's the point &mdash; to see how easy data abstraction makes this problem.</div>
    <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
    <ol>
    <li>Read through all the blocks you wrote on the previous page, and write down a list of all the ones that assume that the list you're sorting has words or numbers, rather than Contacts (the abstract data type from Lab 1), as items.</li>
    <li>Compare your ideas with another group.</li>
    <li>Edit your <code>min</code> block so that instead of comparing text or numeric values, it compares two Contacts, using the <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/name-sorted-block.png" alt="sorting form of name: ( )"> block.
 <!--   <a id="hintbutton" onClick="document.getElementById('hintbutton').innerHTML='The list input slot in the <code>name</code> block counts as one empty slot for <code>combine</code>.';">(Don't click unless you really, really need a super big hint.)</a>  -->
    </li>
    <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work" />
    <li>Now try 
      <img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sort-contact-list.png" alt="sort (contact list)">. Debug it if necessary.  Make sure the contacts are sorted by <em>last</em> name (family name, if you did the TIF on page 2 of Lab 1).</li>
      </ol></div>
      <div class="ifTime">
      <ol start="5">
    <li>Add a &quot;sort by name&quot; button to your contact list app. It should replace <var>contact list</var> with a sorted version of itself.</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="takeItFurther">
    <ol type="A">
<li>It's a shame that, now that your <code>sort</code> block sorts contacts, it doesn't work for numbers any more.  Make a
<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sort-using.png" alt="sort (list) using comparison function (predicate)"> block.  You should be able to sort numbers with
<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/sort-using-less.png" alt="sort ( ) using comparison function (&lt;)">.
<ol type="a">
<li>The block's second input <em>must</em> have a type of Predicate (not Boolean).  That puts the gray ring around the input slot, so that the input is the function itself, not the result of calling the function. (You'll find Predicate in the same type-choosing window in which you can declare an input to be Number or List type.)</li>
<li>Pass the input predicate down to <code>min</code>, also as an input of type Predicate.</li>
<li>To use the predicate inside <code>min</code>, do this:<br />
<img src="/bjc-r/img/3-lists/call-pred.png" alt="call (pred) with inputs (a) (b)"><br />
where <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are the two values you want to compare. To get the &quot;with inputs&quot; part of the <code>call</code> block, you have to click the right arrowhead at the very end of the block (twice, since you want two input slots).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Make sure you can sort both lists of numbers and lists of contacts by using appropriate predicates as the second input to <code>sort</code>.
<li>Use your block to sort a list of numbers from largest to smallest.
<li>What would happen if you used <code>≤</code> instead of <code>&lt;</code>
    in your comparison function? To see the effect, set up a contact list with several entries with the same name but different phone numbers or addresses.
    </ol>
