            It would be nice to create a data-plot of the average time it takes a reporter to ouput, given a list of inputs. To do this, you'll want to create a list. The reporter <code> make a list of times for a reporter between two inputs </code> creates such a list. Here's how it looks in action:<br />

            What's happened here is that Alphie's reporter (adding the numbers between 1 and some upper limit) was applied to upper limits between  100 and 10000, and <code>average time</code>'d along the way.  The input 2 specifies what "along the way" means:  these special inputs start with 100 and are multiplied by 2 until you get the largest multiple less than 10000:<br />

            It's important to recognize that an unreasonable-time algorithm <strong>still solves a problem correctly</strong>. Unreasonable-time algorithms can sometimes be replaced by <em>heuristics</em>, which are polynomial-time algorithms that don't solve the problem exactly, but give a good enough approximation.</div>
        <div class="comment">Yellowbox-Hint this too. --MF, 9/26/18</div>
        <p>One reason it's worth learning these categories is that in writing programs, you often need to solve a problem for which there are already established solutions. For example, you've learned that searching for something in an unordered list takes linear time, but if the list is sorted, you can search it faster (in sublinear time).  So when you're writing a program that needs to search through a list repeatedly, you'll know that it's worthwhile to sort the list before the searching. Knowing about standard algorithms that already exist can help you construct new algorithms.</p>

                                As the population size is multiplied by 10, the time needed for entering data is also multiplied by 10, so for a population of 1,000,000, it should take about 10&times;200=2000 hours.

                                As the population size is multiplied by 10, time needed for backing up data is multiplied by 10, so for a population of 1,000,000, it should take about 10&times;50=500 hours.

                                Correct! <!--Sorting the data seems to go up exponentially as the the population grows. For a population of 1,000,000, it should take about 10,000 hours.-->  As the population size is multiplied by 10, the time needed for the sorting of data is multiplied by 100.  So, for a population of 1,000,000, it should take about 100&times;100=10,000 hours.
