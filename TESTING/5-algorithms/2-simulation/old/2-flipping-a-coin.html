            <h2>Slated for removal</h2>
            <p>Paul suggests scrapping this page, and both Brian and Mary agree on the grounds that the situation is too simple to warrant a simulation. In the removal though, we should carefully read over this page and its TG to see if there is any idea or text worth salvaging for the Disease Spread Project. --MF, 1/28/19</p>

            <p>PG: SCRAP. This feels so narrow and overspecified that the importance of modeling is swamped by the pointless decorations. All the video shows is how clever we can be with costumes, no intellectual content and, more importantly, no genuine relationship to modeling. And all the Snap file shows is how clever its builder was. We should NEVER do that to our students. Building the histogram generator would also not be modeling, but might well be worthy. That isn't done.  </p>
            <p>BH: Get rid of hints page; put good hints in expanding link.  Also, "Do this on your own" sounds like we want them not to pair program.</p>

        <p>When you toss a coin, you assume that the chances of getting a head or a tail are equal. But if you toss a coin 10 times, you know that you might not get exactly 5 heads and 5 tails. What percent of the time do you get that result? Is it different if you tossed the coin 100 times? 1000 times?  It is tiresome and impractical to toss a coin hundreds or thousands of times, but it is possible to explore these questions with a <em>simulation</em>. In this project you will simulate the flipping of a coin and test your hypotheses.</p>

                    linked here</a> to see a possible implementation of what you are trying to achieve with your the simulation. Before starting to program in Snap<em>!</em>, plan out the sequence of events that will occur in your simulation:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When and how will the user input the desired number of flips?</li>
                        <li>How will the program simulate the coin toss mathematically?</li>
                        <li>How will the program simulate the coin toss visually?  What will the user see?</li>
                        <li>What are the variables to create in order to keep track of the important parameters in the simulation?  When should these be initialized?  When should they be updated?</li>
                    </ul>
                    Before building your algorithm in Snap<em>!</em>, work through your pseudocode with a few example inputs until you have debugged it as much as possible.

                    If you toss a coin 10 times and repeat this 10-toss trial many times, how likely do you think each possible percentage of heads will be across all trials?  Here are two examples of possible distributions of the percentage of heads across many 10-toss trials. Which shape of a histogram do you expect in your class simulations?<br />

                <li>Use your program to simulate tossing a coin 10 times and record the percentage of heads that is observed. Combine your results as a class to graphically display the distribution of this percentage with a histogram. Are the results in accordance with what you predicted?</li>
                <li>If you were to repeat the above experiment but this time tossing the coin 100 times (doing 100-toss trials), how would you expect your histogram of percentage of heads to change? Test your hypothesis using your simulation and combining the results as a class. </li>
