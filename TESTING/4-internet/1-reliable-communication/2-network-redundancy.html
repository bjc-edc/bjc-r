			<p>Thomas (David) Petite (born 1956) is a member of the Fond du Lac Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa tribe. David is best known for his work on wireless enabled devices. He is one of the early inventors of the wireless ad hoc networks, a temporary decentralized type of wireless network that enables all mobile phones to work today. His inventions were also a driving force behind the development of what is now known as the "Smart Grid" which monitors and harnesses the power of wireless-enabled devices at a specific location.</p>

        <p>Given the enormous number of devices on the Internet and the reality that pieces of a complex system fail at unexpected times (and often in groups of neighbors such as a whole city), the Internet had to be designed to be <em>reliable</em>. This is achieved by building many <em>redundant</em> connections into the physical systems of the Internet. That way, if part of the Internet fails, data can be re-routed via a different <em>path</em>. And such changes to the path can happen in transit because <em>routing</em> on the Internet is dynamic; it is not specified in advance. Creating such redundancy can require additional resources (such as additional computers and cables) but it also increases the Internet's <em>fault tolerance</em> (ability to work around problems) and helps the Internet <em>scale</em> (expand) to more devices and people.</p>

        <p>In the animation, a lightening bolt strikes one of the nodes. There are many reasons a node can fail, such as power failure, chip burnout, etc. The other thing that can happen is that the nodes can all be fine, but the green lines linking the nodes, which represent connections, could fail (e.g., a cable could be cut or disconnected, either accidentally or on purpose).</p>

                            In this model of a network, what is the <em>minimum</em> number of nodes (connection points) that can stop working before the sender and the receiver can't communicate? (Other than the sender or the receiver themselves, of course.)
