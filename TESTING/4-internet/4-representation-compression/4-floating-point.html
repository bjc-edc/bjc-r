            <p>Scientific notation (such as 2,350,000 = 2.35 &times; 10<sup>6</sup>) uses powers of ten to represent very large or very small values. <strong>Floating point</strong> is the same idea but with powers of two.</p></div>

            <div id="hint-float" class="collapse">This non-obvious name is used because there used to be a <em>fixed point</em> non-integer notation with a <em>fixed</em> number of digits after the decimal <em>point.</em> For example, a fixed point notation with two digits after the decimal point was used to represent an amount of money in dollars and cents: $82.47. But today's computers always use floating point for non-integer values.</div>

            In Snap<em>!</em>, you can store any data type in a variable (number, text string, list, costume, <code>quiz item</code>, etc.). But in some languages, you have to declare what kind of data your variables will store. If you have a collection of values, it's obvious that you'll need a list to store it. But it's not always obvious how best to represent a value in a computer program. For example, the most straightforward way to represent an amount of money is in <em>floating point</em> because it allows for decimals. But if you use floating point to store a value like 3.20, it's likely to be displayed to the user as 3.2, and people rarely write money this way. Instead, even though it's more programming effort, you might choose to create an abstract data type <code>money, dollars: ( ) cents: ( )</code> with two integer inputs so that you can control how the value is displayed.

            <p>Floating point allows computers to store very large numbers and also decimals, but the format still has a specific number of bits, and that limits the range of floating point values and mathematical operations just as with integers. However with floating point, values that exceed the limitation may result in <em>round off</em> errors instead.</p>

		<p>The decimal representation of ⅓ is 0.33333... It has infinitely many digits, so the closest you can come in floating point isn't <em>exactly</em> ⅓; it gets cut off after a while because your computer doesn't have enough memory.</p>

            <div id="hint-roundoff" class="collapse">These results seem surprising because a fractional value such as 0.2 can be represented exactly <em>in decimal</em> (unlike the example of ⅓). But <em>in binary,</em> only fractions whose denominator is a power of 2 can be represented exactly. So 2/16 can be represented exactly, but 2/10 can't. The binary floating point representation of 0.2 is just slightly too big, and so is the binary representation of 0.4. Adding two slightly-too-big values produces an error big enough to get to the next higher representable value.</div>

		<p>No matter how good the hardware is, certain kinds of computations are likely to give severe errors in floating point.  One simple example is subtracting two numbers that are almost equal in value.  The correct answer will be near zero, and if it's near enough, it will <em>underflow</em> and an exact zero might be reported.</p>

            <p>A notorious example is the fate of the Ariane rocket launched on June 4, 1996 (European Space Agency 1996). In the 37th second of flight, the inertial reference system attempted to convert a 64-bit floating-point number to a 16-bit number, but instead triggered an overflow error which was interpreted by the guidance system as flight data, causing the rocket to veer off course and be destroyed.</p>
            <p>The Patriot missile defense system used during the Gulf War was also rendered ineffective due to roundoff error (Skeel 1992, U.S. GAO 1992). The system used an integer timing register which was incremented at intervals of 0.1 s. However, the integers were converted to decimal numbers by multiplying by the binary approximation of 0.1, 0.00011001100110011001100<sub>2</sub> = 209715/2097152.</p>

        <p>Computer arithmetic on <em>integers</em> is straightforward. Either you get an exactly correct integer result or, if the result won't fit in (non-bignum) integer representation, you get an <em>overflow error</em> and the result is, usually, converted to floating point representation (as 30! was).</p>
        <p>By contrast, computer arithmetic on <em>floating point numbers</em> is hard to get exactly right. Prior to 1985, every model of computer had a slightly different floating point format, and all of them got wrong answers to certain problems. This situation was resolved by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point" target="_blank" title="IEEE 754">IEEE 754 floating point standard</a>, which is now used by every computer manufacturer and has been improved several times since it was created in 1985.</p>

                If the subtle errors in floating point computation turn out to be unacceptable in a particular application, software can use alternative representations:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Exact rationals.</strong>
                    Two bignums, one for the numerator and one for the denominator, can be used to represent any fractional value exactly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Binary coded decimal.</strong> A decimal digit can be represented in four bits, with a few four-bit combinations left over for a minus sign and a decimal point. A sequence of decimal digits of any length can be used to create decimal bignums, representing exactly any fractional value that takes a finite number of decimal digits. This would avoid the 0.2+0.4 problem, but wouldn't work for problems involving ⅓.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decimal floating point.</strong> If the binary coded decimal notation is extended with a four-bit code for "times ten to the power," numbers in (base 10) scientific notation can be represented exactly.</li>

        <br />
        No, sorry.  The type encoding works fine. In bignum mode you get correct answers. In non-bignum (floating point), the issue is that in <em>binary</em> floating point, 1/10 is an infinite fraction, like 1/3 in decimal. So roundoff errors are possible. --bh</div>Programming languages differ in how they do this, but there's always some <em>extra</em> bit sequence that encodes the <em>data type</em> of any sequence of bits that tells the computer how to interpret it.</p>
		<div class="takeNote">At the lowest level of software abstraction, <em>everything</em> in a computer is represented as a binary sequence. For example:
        	<ul>
            	<li>A Boolean value is a single bit, 0 for <code>false</code> and 1 for <code>true</code>.</li>
                <li>A text string is a sequence of Unicode character codes, each of which is stored as a separate integer.</li>

                <p>
                    In well-designed languages (those based on Scheme, for example), that data type code is attached to the value itself. In other languages, when you make a variable, you have to say what type of value it will contain, and the data type is attached to the <em>variable</em>, so you can't both get exact answers when the values are integers and also be able to handle non-integer values of the same variable. So instead of seeing:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/varfoo.png" alt="script variables (foo)" title="script variables (foo)"><br />

                	<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/intfoo.png" alt="integer (foo)" title="integer (foo)"><br />
                    In a language with <em>dynamic typing</em> (where you don't have to declare the types of variables) it's just as easy to make a list whose items are of different data types as it is to make one whose items are all the same type (all integers or all character strings, etc.)
                </p>
                <p>Snap<em>!</em> has strengths that many programming languages do not, and it's very likely that your <em>next</em> computer science class will use one of those other languages.</p>
