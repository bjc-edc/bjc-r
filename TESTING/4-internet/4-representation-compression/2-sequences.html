            In case someone wants to do more with the project one day:
            <ul>
                <li>The color version of the project (<a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/6-computers/U6L1-TranslatingBinary_color.xml" target="_blank">U6L1-TranslatingBinary_color.xml</a>) breaks Snap<em>!</em> because of an unresolved bug (<a href="https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks/issues/1873" target="_blank">#1873</a>). </li>
                <li>The PHP script that I used to get the binary sequences for images is here: <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/utilities/colorreader.php" target="_blank">http://localhost/bjc-r/utilities/colorreader.php</a>. Edit the $im variable initialization (currently line 9) to change the path of the color file exported into a binary sequence, and edit the $imbw initialization (currently line 59) to change the B&amp;W file. It would be amazing to incorporate this into the project, but that would require being able to handle uploaded images or images with an existing URL, and I haven't thought through that possibility yet. --MF, 11/30/17</li>

            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn more about how information is represented inside the computer as sequences of bits.</p>
		</div>
		
        <div class="sidenote">In many programming languages there's a convention that every text string ends with a <em>null</em> byte, in which all eight bits are zero, a code that's reserved for this purpose. So our "<code>Welcome...</code>" string might actually occupy 44 bytes.</div>
        <p>So far we've been working with small chunks of data, from Boolean values (one bit) to characters (eight bits). But of course some information in your computer or smartphone is much bigger than that. For starters, characters aren't generally used one at a time; they're used in <em>text strings</em> such as "<code>Welcome to the Beauty and Joy of Computing.</code>" These 43 characters occupy 43 bytes of computer memory. But the real champion users of space are media files: pictures, sounds (mostly music), and video.</p>
        <p>If we could see inside the memory's bits, a section of the memory might look something like this:</p>

        <p>"Binary sequence" is a very broad category, and often, several layers of abstraction are built on it. For example, you can include a picture in an email or text message, in which case, the <em>message</em> includes a <em>picture</em>, which is a kind of <em>file</em>, which is a kind of <em>binary sequence</em>.</p>

            <p><strong>Analog</strong> data have values that change smoothly, unlike digital data which change in discrete intervals.</p>
            <p><strong>Sampling</strong> means measuring values, called <strong>samples</strong>, of an analog signal at regular intervals.</p>
	    <p>The <strong>sampling rate</strong> is the number of samples measured per second.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Not all data are naturally digital.  (That is, they may not be individual values that can be represented in the form of binary sequences.)  Some real-world values (such as the pitch and volume of music, the colors of a painting, or the position of a sprinter during a race) change smoothly over time or position; they are <em>analog</em>. When analog data are encoded digitally (as bits on a computer), their values are approximated. This is an example of abstraction. The continuously changing air pressure of a sound, for example, is <em>sampled</em> (measured) thousands of times a second, and the samples are stored as bits.</p>

 	            A text is a finite number of characters, each of which comes from a finite alphabet. So a book without pictures is naturally digital. When a piece of music is written down, there are a finite number of possible notes, so there's a finite "alphabet" of symbols such as &#x266B; or &#x1d122;, and the piece of music uses only finitely many of them. So the <em>score,</em> the written notation for the music, is naturally digital. But the actual sound of words being read or music being played includes much more information (such as they way someone says the words, their accent, or the way each instrument sounds). So speech and musical performance are <em>not</em> naturally digital.

        <div class="takeNote" style="clear: right;">
            <p>So if pictures, music, and words all look the same in memory—all binary sequences—how can the computer tell what any chunk of memory actually is? For example, should the sequence 01000001 be interpreted as the number 65, the letter A, a rather dark shade of red, or something else?</p>
            <div class="comment">DAT-1.A.7</div>
            <p>The meaning of a sequence of bits depends on the context in which it is used. What exactly do we mean by "context"? How does a programming language know whether to interpret a bit sequence as an integer, a picture, a string of characters, an instruction, or something else? There's always <em>another</em> bit sequence somewhere that encodes the <strong>data type</strong> of the bit sequence.</p>

            But different languages use data types differently. In high-level languages, that data type code is attached to <em>the value itself.</em>  In lower-level languages, when you make a variable, you have to say what type of value it will contain, and the data type is attached to the <em>variable</em>, so you can't get exact answers when the values are integers and <em>also</em> be able to handle non-integer values of the same variable. So instead of seeing <br />
