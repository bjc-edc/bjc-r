                        <li>I get upset/mad every time I think about...</li>
                        <li>The world can be so unfair - I care about issues that affect...</li>

                <li>What are some ways that technology might be used to address some of these issues?</li>
                <li>What are some things technology <em>can't</em> do to address some of these issues?</li>
