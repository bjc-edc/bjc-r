        <p>Social media are designed to improve lives by helping people communicate and collaborate, but cyberbullying was an unexpected, illegal, and unethical misuse. It would have been better if the programmers who invented social media had anticipated these possibilities (although it's not obvious what they would have done differently). Today, responsible programmers do try to predict possible misuses of their software before they release it to the world. But it's not possible for programmers to anticipate all of the possible misuses of a technology.</p>
