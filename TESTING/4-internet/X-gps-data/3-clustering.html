        <p>Big Burgers wants to answer this key question: <em>where should the new restaurant be?</em> By visualizing the 223 data points, they've learned new information about their customers.</p>

                    I had edited this section to correct it for block dependencies (see <a href="https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks/issues/1126" target="_blank">Snap Issue #1126</a>), but it got unreasonable, so I just cut all this text. --MF
					<p>If you did <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/old/3-three-key-list-ops/4-combine.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment">Unit 3 Lab 3 Page 4: The Combine Block</a>, you've built an <code>average</code> block that returns the average of a list of values. You can use your own block or the one we present below.</p>

                        <li>
                            Import the <code>average</code> block into your current project by doing one of the following (either a or b):

                                        <li>Starting from the Unit 3 project, in Snap<em>!</em>, choose "Export blocks..." from the File menu.</li>
                                        <li>Right-click in the "Export blocks" window and choose "none" to de-select all the blocks, then hit OK.</li>
                                        <li>Find and click on the <code>average</code> block, the <code>combine</code> block (if you used it), the <code>empty?</code> block (which is embedded in <code>combine</code>), and any other blocks that you used in your <code>average</code> block (like a <code>sum</code> block), then click OK. This will generate an XML file.</li>
                                        <li>In your current project, choose "Import..." from the File menu, then select the XML file you just generated.</li>
                                        <li>The <code>average</code> block should now be usable in your current project.</li>

        <div class="comment">BK: I wonder if "40.70" would be better than "40.7" in the graphic here. Both are correct.</div>
        
        <p>Here's a visualization of the GPS data, along with some latitude lines for reference. The GPS data breaks into three clear zones:</p>
        
        <img class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/4-internet/GPS-map.png" alt="GPS data plus latitude lines">
        
        <p>
            Based on the visualization, Big Burgers will place their restaurant in the zone with the largest number of customers. But, which one is it? 
            <div class="sidenote">Taking a large data set and breaking it into smaller groups is called <strong>cluster analysis</strong>. Visualizations of data are especially helpful in identifying and classifying clusters.</div>
        </p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="5">
                <li>Given a specific pair of GPS coordinates, how might you decide which of the three zones it is in?</li>
                <li>Create a <code>zone</code> block. The input is a pair of GPS coordinates, and the output indicates which zone the coordinates are in.</li>
                <li>Use the <code>zone</code> block and the full set of GPS data to determine which of the three zones has the most customers.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>Now that Big Burgers knows the general area to place the restaurant, they still need to determine where <em>within that zone</em> to place it. To do this, they need a new list of the GPS coordinates of those customers within that zone.</p>

                <li>Use the <code>average</code> block to compute the average of all the longitudes and latitudes of the GPS data <strong>within the most popular zone</strong>.</li>
                <li>On a map, find the location where the data says the restaurant should be located. What practical limitations might there be to this analysis?</li>
