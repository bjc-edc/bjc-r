                    <p>You can visit this <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Convert-from-Decimal-to-Binary" target="_blank" title="Wikihow: How to Convert from Decimal to Binary">wikihow.com</a> page and discuss conversion from base 10 to base 2.</p>
                    <p>
                        Note that there are two methods presented in the link.
                  <ul>
                            <li>The first method (<em>Short Division by Two with Remainder</em>), is more general and works for conversion to any base.</li>
                            <li>The second method (<em>Descending Powers of Two and Subtraction</em>), is in tandem with a <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/youtube/cDZzsHvi44Q" target="_blank" title="Abstraction: Base Conversion">video</a> you may have watched earlier.</li>
                  </ul>
                        Choose one of the methods described and come up with a simple algorithm for this procedure.
                    </p>
              </div>
                <li><a class="run" href="/bjc-r/prog/6-computers/U6-BinaryTimer.xml" target="_blank"><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/load-save.png" alt="Click here to load this file. Then save it to your Snap! account." title="Click here to load this file. Then save it to your Snap! account."></a><br />Several sprites, blocks, and costumes have already been created for you. The <code>Get Binary Digits</code> block (in Timer) is the only place where you will need to fill in some code. </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
           
        <p>

            If you look at the Timer sprite code, you will see that the <code>timer</code> block (from the "Sensing" menu) is used as a time keeper.  The decimal and binary digits are computed and stored in lists, and then a broadcast is made to the sprites representing the digits to put on the appropriate costumes (0 and 1 for the binary digits and 0 through 9 for the decimal digits.)
            </p><br />

            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/6-computers/BinaryClock_img/TimerCode.png" height="400"  alt="when green flag clicked{reset timer; repeat until(round(timer)>(255)){script variables (time); set (time) to (round(timer)); set (Decimal Digits List) to empty list; set (Binary Digits List) to empty list; warp{Get Binary Digits (time); Get Decimal Digits (time); broadcast (time)}}}" title="when green flag clicked{reset timer; repeat until(round(timer)>(255)){script variables (time); set (time) to (round(timer)); set (Decimal Digits List) to empty list; set (Binary Digits List) to empty list; warp{Get Binary Digits (time); Get Decimal Digits (time); broadcast (time)}}}"/>
        </p>
        <p>The "warp" block is used to ensure that all the computation within the block is completed prior to the refreshing of the screen .</p>
        <p>The code for extracting the base 10 digits of a given number,<code>Get Decimal Digits</code>, is written for you. If you are using method 2 (<em>Descending Powers of Two and Subtraction</em>) to write <code>Get Binary Digits</code> you can ignore the code in <code>Get Decimal Digits</code>.  If you are using method 1 (<em>Short Division by Two with Remainder</em>) however, you can use this code as a model to write the <code>Get Binary Digits</code> code as it is based on method 1.  </p>

                <li>Review and understand the code for the rest of the sprites representing the decimal digits.  Check that your timer works in the decimal notation.</li>
                <li>Now write the code for the <code>Get Binary Digits</code> custom block using either conversion method.  If you get stuck, you can get some <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/optional-projects/1b-binary-counter-hints.html" target="_blank" title="Hints"> hints for the Binary Timer project</a>.  When you are done, review the code for the sprites representing the 8 binary digits. Check that the timer works in the binary notation. </li>

                    In this project, you generated the binary number representation of decimal numbers 0 through 255. While it takes only 3 digits to represent the number 255 in base 10, it requires 8 digits to represent the same number in base 2. Can you explain why?
