                    An algorithm takes <strong>polynomial time</strong> if the number of steps is less than or equal to a power of the size of the input, such as constant (<em>n</em><sup>0</sup>), sublinear, linear (<em>n</em><sup>1</sup>), quadratic (<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>), or cubic (<em>n</em><sup>3</sup>).

                    An algorithm takes <strong>exponential time</strong> if the number of steps is proportional to an exponential function of the size of the input, such as 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>, 10<sup><em>n</em></sup>, etc., which is much slower than any polynomial.

                        A <strong>correlation</strong> is a particular kind of information, namely a dependence between two variables. For example in the first picture here, as one variable goes up the other goes down. It's also a correlation when as one variable goes up or down the other changes in the same manner.

            <p><strong>Cleaning data</strong> is the process of making the data uniform <em>without changing its meaning</em> (such as replacing abbreviations, spellings, and capitalizations with the intended word or converting miles to kilometers). Programmers can use programs to filter and clean digital data, thereby gaining insight and knowledge.</p>

            <p>An <strong>unsolvable problem</strong> is one for which no algorithm can ever be written to find the solution.</p> 
            <p>An <strong>undecidable problem</strong> is one for which no algorithm can ever be written that will always give a correct <em>true/false decision</em> for every input value. Undecidable problems are a subcategory of unsolvable problems that include only problems that should have a yes/no answer (such as: does my code have a bug?).</p>
