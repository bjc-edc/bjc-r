            <ul>

                <li>A <strong>problem</strong> is a general description of a task that may (or may not) be solved algorithmically.</li>

                <li>An <strong>instance of a problem</strong> is one case of a problem, with specific inputs.</li>

        	<div class="comment">AAP-2.P.1, AAP-2.P.2</div>

            <p>A <strong>binary search</strong> algorithm starts in the middle of a <em>sorted</em> list and repeatedly eliminates half the list until either the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated.</p>

            <div class="comment">AAP-2.O.1</div>

            <div class="sidenoteBig">You learned about traversing a list on <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/3-traversing-list.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 2 Lab 2 Page 3: Checking Each Quiz Answer">Unit 2 Lab 2 Page 3: Checking Each Quiz Answer</a>.</div>

            <p>Linear search does a <em>complete</em> traversal of the list. Binary search saves time by doing a <em>partial</em> traversal of the list.</p>

            <p>The relationship between the input size and the number of steps required to solve a problem is the <strong>efficiency</strong> of the algorithm used to solve the problem.</p>

            <ul>

                <li>

                    An algorithm takes <strong>polynomial time</strong> if the number of steps is less than or equal to a power of the size of the input, such as constant (<em>n</em><sup>0</sup>), sublinear, linear (<em>n</em><sup>1</sup>), quadratic (<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>), or cubic (<em>n</em><sup>3</sup>).

                    

                </li>

                <li>

                    An algorithm takes <strong>exponential time</strong> if the number of steps is proportional to an exponential function of the size of the input, such as 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>, 10<sup><em>n</em></sup>, etc., which is much slower than any polynomial.

                <li>A <strong>decision problem</strong> is a problem with a true/false answer (for example, "is 5,825,496,221 a prime number?").</li>

                <li>An <strong>optimization problem</strong> is one with the goal of finding the <em>best</em> solution among many (for example, "what's the best school schedule to place every student into as many of their requested classes as possible?").</li>

            <div class="comment">CSN-2.A.1, CSN-2.A.2</div>

            <p>

                This section covers two computational models:

                <ul>

                    <li>In <strong>sequential computing</strong>, operations are performed in order one at a time.</li>

                    <li>In <strong>parallel computing</strong>, the program is broken into smaller steps, some of which are performed at the same time. Modern computers have multiple processors (2, 4, or 8) in a single computer, so you can do small-scale parallel processing on the machine on your desk.</li>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Data</strong> are the values that computers receive from various sources, including human activity, sensors, etc.</li>

                <li><strong>Information</strong> is the humanly-useful patterns extracted from data.</li>

            <p><div class="comment">DAT-2.A.2</div>Data provide opportunities for identifying trends, making connections, and addressing problems. Information is the result of analyzing that data.</p>

            <ul>

                <li>A <strong>record</strong> is one row in a dataset (other than the first row, which contains the column headings). A single record might be the data for one student in your school, the data for one earthquake that happened, the data for one hospital in the U.S, or the data for one contact in your contact list. In other words, a record is a horizontal slice of the dataset.</li>

                <li>A <strong>field</strong> is one item of a record in a dataset. It might be one person's homeroom teacher, the magnitude of an earthquake in Los Angeles last week, the owner of one hospital in Chicago, or the phone number of one person in your contact list.</li>

                <li>A <strong>column</strong> is a list containing the data from one field for all records in a dataset. A column might be the homeroom teacher for <em>every</em> student in your school, the magnitude of <em>every</em> earthquake in the dataset, the owner of <em>every</em> hospital in the U.S., or the phone number of <em>every</em> person in your contact list. In other words, a column is a vertical slice of the dataset.</li>

<h3>Lab 4: Unsolvable and Undecidable Problems</h3>

  <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/5-algorithms/4-unsolvable-undecidable/2-halting-problem.html">5.4.2</a>:
            <p>An <strong>infinite loop</strong> is a sequence of computer instructions that repeats forever.</p>

            <p>An <strong>unsolvable problem</strong> is one for which no algorithm can ever be written to find the solution.</p> 

            <p>An <strong>undecidable problem</strong> is one for which no algorithm can ever be written that will always give a correct <em>true/false decision</em> for every input value. Undecidable problems are a subcategory of unsolvable problems that include only problems that should have a yes/no answer (such as: does my code have a bug?).</p>
