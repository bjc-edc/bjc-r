<h3>Lab 1: Computer Abstraction Hierarchy</h3>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">  <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/1-abstraction/01-abstraction.html">6.1.1</a>: <strong>analog</strong> vs. <strong>digital</strong>

        	<p>Digital and analog are opposites. <strong>Digital</strong> means information that is represented as <em>ones and zeros</em>. <strong>Analog</strong> means information that is represented by signals that <em>vary continuously</em> (that is, including in-between values).</p>

			<div class="comment">AAP-3.D.1, AAP-3.D.2, AAP-3.D.3</div>

            <ul>

                <li>A <strong>software library</strong> is a package of procedures that you can import into your program. A library is a kind of abstraction: you don't have to know any of the details of how it's coded. You can build libraries yourself, or you can use one that someone else wrote.</li>

                <!--<div class="comment">AAP-3.D.4, AAP-3.D.5</div>

                <li>An <strong>application program interface (API)</strong> documents what the user of a library needs to know about it: it's a description of each procedure's purpose, inputs, and outputs (but not its algorithms).</li>-->

            </ul>

  <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/1-abstraction/06-digital-architecture.html">6.1.6</a>:
			<p><strong>Machine language</strong> is the lowest-level programming language; it is directly understood by the computer hardware.</p>

            <p><strong>Architecture</strong> is an abstraction, a specification of the machine language. It also tells how the processor connects to the memory. It doesn't specify the circuitry; the same architecture can be built as circuitry in many different ways.</p>

			<p><strong>Moore's Law</strong> is the prediction that the number of transistors that fit on one chip doubles every year.</p>
