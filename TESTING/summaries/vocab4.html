<h3>Lab 1: Computer Networks</h3>

            <p>

                <strong>TCP/IP</strong> is a pair of protocols that provide two levels of abstraction: 

                <ul>

                    <li><strong>IP</strong> (Internet Protocol) lets your computer pretend it has a <em>direct</em> connection to another computer. The routers at every connection point on the Internet run IP, which transmits packets from one IP address to another.</li>

                    <li><strong>TCP</strong> (Transmission Control Protocol) lets your computer pretend it has a <em>reliable</em> connection to the other computer. The computers (including servers) at the two endpoints of a communication run TCP, which guarantees that packets arrive successfully.</li>

                </ul>

            </p>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Encryption</strong> is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access.</li>

                <li><strong>Decryption</strong> is the process of decoding the data. </li>

            </ul>

            <div class="comment">IOC-2.B.5</div>

            <p><strong>Public key encryption</strong> uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The sender uses the public key to encrypt the message, and receiver uses their private key to decrypt it. </p>

        <div class="vocabFullWidth">  <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-cybersecurity/5-security-risks.html">4.2.5</a>: <p>A <strong>rogue access&nbsp;point</strong> is a wireless access point that gives access to a secure network without the authorization of the network administrator.</p></div>

                        <p>The <strong>digital divide</strong> refers to unequal access to computers and the Internet based on poverty, racism, sexism, isolation in the countryside, age, and other factors. The digital divide affects both individuals within a country and countries themselves.</p>

                <div class="comment">IOC-1.E.3, IOC-1.E.4 (vocab box)</div>

                <li><strong>Citizen science</strong> is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices.</li>

                <li><strong>Crowdsourcing</strong> is the general term for using the Internet to get a lot of people to help solve a problem. (Citizen science is a type of crowdsourcing.)</li>

                <div class="comment">CRD-2.A, IOC-1.B</div>

                <li>Pick another computing innovation (whether in the arts, science, or solving a practical problem), and write about its original purpose and unintended consequences. What was it designed for in the first place? What were the consequences, how were they missed in the design of the innovation, and how did the designers respond when they appeared? Make a chart like the Facebook example above.</li>

<h3>Lab 4: Data Representation and Compression</h3>

  <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-representation-compression/4-floating-point.html">4.4.4</a>:
            <p>Scientific notation (such as 2,350,000 = 2.35 &times; 10<sup>6</sup>) uses powers of ten to represent very large or very small values. <strong>Floating point</strong> is the same idea but with powers of two.</p></div>

            <p><strong>Lossless data&nbsp;compression</strong> algorithms (such as PNG) are reversible (there is no loss in quality); you can reconstruct the original data. </p>
