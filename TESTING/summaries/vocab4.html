<h3>Lab 1: Computer Networks</h3>
<div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-reliable-communication/3-open-protocols.html">4.1.3</a>
            <p>
                <strong>TCP/IP</strong> is a pair of protocols that provide two levels of abstraction: 
                </p>
<ul>
                    <li>
<strong>IP</strong> (Internet Protocol) lets your computer pretend it has a <em>direct</em> connection to another computer. The routers at every connection point on the Internet run IP, which transmits packets from one IP address to another.</li>
                    <li>
<strong>TCP</strong> (Transmission Control Protocol) lets your computer pretend it has a <em>reliable</em> connection to the other computer. The computers (including servers) at the two endpoints of a communication run TCP, which guarantees that packets arrive successfully.</li>
                </ul>

<h3>Lab 2: Cybersecurity</h3>
<div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-cybersecurity/1-cryptography.html">4.2.1</a>: <strong>Encryption and Decryption</strong>
            <div class="comment">IOC-2.B.5</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
<strong>Encryption</strong> is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                <li>
<strong>Decryption</strong> is the process of decoding the data. </li>
            </ul>
        </div><div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-cybersecurity/1-cryptography.html">4.2.1</a>: <strong>Symmetric Encryption</strong>
            <div class="comment">IOC-2.B.5</div>
            <p>Substitution ciphers are examples of <strong>symmetric encryption</strong> because they use the <em>same key</em> for both encryption and decryption.</p>
        </div> 

<div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-cybersecurity/3-asymmetric_cryptography.html">4.2.3</a>
            <div class="comment">IOC-2.B.5</div>
            <p><strong>Public key encryption</strong> uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The sender uses the public key to encrypt the message, and receiver uses their private key to decrypt it. </p>
        </div> 

<div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-cybersecurity/5-security-risks.html">4.2.5</a>: <p>A <strong>rogue access point</strong> is a wireless access point that gives access to a secure network without the authorization of the network administrator.</p>
</div> 

<h3>Lab 3: Community and Online Interactions</h3>
<div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-community/5-computing-world.html">4.3.5</a>
                        <div class="comment">IOC-1.C.1, IOC-1.C.2, IOC-1.C.3</div>
                        <p>The <strong>digital divide</strong> refers to unequal access to computers and the Internet based on poverty, racism, sexism, isolation in the countryside, age, and other factors. The digital divide affects both individuals within a country and countries themselves.</p>
                    </div> 

<div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-community/6-benefits.html">4.3.6</a>
            <ul>
                <div class="comment">IOC-1.E.3, IOC-1.E.4 (vocab box)</div>
                <li>
<strong>Citizen science</strong> is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices.</li>
                <li>
<strong>Crowdsourcing</strong> is the general term for using the Internet to get a lot of people to help solve a problem. (Citizen science is a type of crowdsourcing.)</li>
            </ul>
        </div><div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/3-community/6-benefits.html">4.3.6</a>
        <div class="comment">CRD-1.A.1, CRD-1.A.2</div>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>computing innovation</strong> can be physical (such as a self-driving car), non-physical software (such as picture editing software), or conceptual (such as the idea of e-commerce), but regardless of the form, they must include a program as an integral part of their function.</li>
            </ul>

<h3>Lab 4: Data Representation and Compression</h3>
<div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-representation-compression/4-floating-point.html">4.4.4</a>
            <p>Scientific notation (such as 2,350,000 = 2.35 × 10<sup>6</sup>) uses powers of ten to represent very large or very small values. <strong>Floating point</strong> is the same idea but with powers of two.</p>
</div> 

<div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-representation-compression/6-compression.html">4.4.6</a>: <strong>Lossless Compression</strong>
            <p><strong>Lossless data compression</strong> algorithms (such as PNG) are reversible (there is no loss in quality); you can reconstruct the original data. </p>
        </div><div class="vocabFullWidth"> <a href="https://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/4-representation-compression/6-compression.html">4.4.6</a>: <strong>Lossy Compression</strong>
            <p><strong>Lossy data compression</strong> algorithms are <em>not</em> fully reversible; you can reconstruct only an <em>approximation</em> of the original data.</p>
