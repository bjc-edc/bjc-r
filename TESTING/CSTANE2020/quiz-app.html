            <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop a quiz app by creating an <em>abstract data type</em> to pair the questions with their answers and by using a new block that loops through a list:<br />

                <p>A <strong>sublist</strong> is a list as an item of another list.</p>
            </div>
            You'll use a list to store your quiz items in a global variable and use a <em>sublist</em> for each question/answer pair. Then you can choose just one pair at a time to work with.

            But code like <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/item-1-of-item-3-of.png" alt="item (1) of (item (3) of (computer science quiz))" title="item (1) of (item (3) of (computer science quiz))" /> is hard to read and understand. A better way is to <em>use abstraction</em> to organize the quiz items. The abstraction just hides the <code>list</code> and <code>item of</code> blocks, so it isn't complicated to build, but it can make your code much easier to write, read, and debug.<br />

                    A <strong>data type</strong> is what kind of data something is (number, text string, list, etc.). For example, <em>number</em> is the data type for the first input to <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/item.png" height="35" alt="item (1) of ()" title="item (1) of ()"> and <em>list</em> is the the data type for its second input.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An <strong>abstract data type</strong> (or <strong>ADT</strong>) is a custom data type that's meaningful to your program. It's not built into the language; you develop it as you code. This is an abstraction because it hides the details inside the constructor and selectors so that the programmer who uses a <code>quiz item</code> has to think only about questions and answers, not about list indices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/quiz-item-constructor.png" alt="quiz item, question: () answer: ()" title="quiz item, question: () answer: ()" /> block is the <strong>constructor</strong>; it <em>constructs</em> one example of the data structure. By naming the pieces of the structure, the constructor makes it certain that every time you use it, you build the structure in the right order.<br />

                    The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/question-selector.png" alt="question from quiz item: ()" title="question from quiz item: ()"/> and <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/answer-selector.png" alt="answer from quiz item: ()" title="answer from quiz item: ()"/> blocks are the <strong>selectors</strong>; they each <em>select</em> one piece of the data structure.<br />

                The students are considering how to use their abstract data type as they develop the code for their project. 
            </div>
            <div><span>Alphie:</span> We can use our <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/question-selector.png" alt="question from quiz item: ()" title="question from quiz item: ()"/> and <img class="" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/answer-selector.png" alt="answer from quiz item: ()" title="answer from quiz item: ()"/> selectors to get the question and answer for quiz item in our list. But how do we get the quiz item <em>out</em> of the list in the first place?</div>
            <div>
                <span>Gamal:</span> Maybe we can use <code>item of</code> inside a <code>for</code> loop and use the index from the <code>for</code> loop as the first input to <code>item of</code>, like this:<br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/for-with-item-of.png" alt="for (i) = (1) to (4) {

                <span>Betsy:</span> Yeah, we could, but that's a little hard to read with that index variable, <var>i</var>, to keep track of. And if we add more questions, we'll have to update that number 4 that tells us when to end the loop. I bet we can use <code>for each</code> to <em>traverse</em> the list.
            </div>
            <div class="stagedir">
                Betsy drags <code>for each</code> into the scripting area.<br />

        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Traversing a List</strong>
            <p><strong>Traversing</strong> a list means looking at each item of the list. <code>For each</code> is iterative. That is, it's repetitive, like <code>for</code>, which can also traverse a list. But unlike <code>for</code>, <code>for each</code> traverses the list <em>without using index numbers</em>.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="5">
                <li>Use <code>for each</code> to <em>traverse</em> the list stored in the <var>computer science quiz</var> variable: asking each quiz question, checking each answer, and letting the user know if they are right or wrong on each item.</li>

                <li>
                    Users might give answers that are close enough but not exactly the answer you expected. For example, someone might answer "What kind of variable is available only in the part of the program where it is defined?" with "a local variable," "local variable," or just "local," or the same possibilities for "script variable." So your <code>question answer</code> ADT could take a <em>list</em> of keywords in the second slot and accept any answer that includes any of the keywords (so in this case, the list would be {local, script} and would accept "a local one"). Use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/contains-empty.png" alt="() contains ()" title="() contains ()" /> to adapt your code.
