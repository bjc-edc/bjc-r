        <p>In this example, it took 27 milliseconds to compute the list of integers from 1 to 1000. (The report you see will depend on how fast your computer is and what other programs are running on it.)</p>

        <h3>Understanding Binary Search: Is "Seperate" Spelled Correctly? (about 5 minutes)</h3>
        <div class="vocabBig">: <strong>Binary Search</strong>
            <p>A <strong>binary search</strong> algorithm starts in the middle of a <em>sorted</em> list and repeatedly eliminates half the list until either the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated.</p>
            <!--<div class="comment">AAP-2.O.1</div>
            <div class="sidenoteBig">You learned about traversing a list on <a href="http://localhost/bjc-r/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/3-traversing-list.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Unit 2 Lab 2 Page 3: Checking Each Quiz Answer">Unit 2 Lab 2 Page 3: Checking Each Quiz Answer</a>.</div>-->
            <p>Linear search does a <em>complete</em> traversal of the list. Binary search saves time by doing a <em>partial</em> traversal of the list.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Checking spelling is simple in Snap<em>!</em> because you can just ask a dictionary: <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/100000-words-contains-seperate.png" alt="100000-words-contains-seperate.png" title="(100,000 words) contains (seperate)" />. But <em>"simple" doesn't mean fast</em>. The <code>contains</code> block still has to look at each item in the list until it finds the one you are looking for (and says <code>true</code>) or reaches the end of the list (and says <code>false</code>). It is still a linear search.</p>
        <p>When you are only looking for <em>one</em> thing in a list (for example, checking whether a particular word is spelled correctly) rather than finding <em>all</em> the words with some characteristic (for example, looking for all five-letter words), the best strategy is a <em>binary search</em> algorithm: always guess the <em>middle</em> value and then adjust your guess based on whether it was too high or too low. That way, you eliminate half the possibilities with each guess. We can use a similar strategy to look for a word in a word list.</p>
                
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="7">
                <li>Check whether "seperate" is spelled correctly by using <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/binary-search.png" alt="binary search for () in 'list input slot'" title="binary search for () in 'list input slot'" /> to look for the word in the sorted list <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/100000-words-(sorted).png" alt="100,000 words (sorted)" title="100,000 words (sorted)" />.</li>

            The actual amount of physical time that it takes to solve a problem depends not only on your algorithm but also on how fast your computer is and what other programs you have running, etc. Therefore, computer scientists who want to measure the speed of an algorithm do it in terms of the number of <em>steps</em>. For example, what we really want to know about the efficiency of the <code>linear search</code> algorithm is how many times <var>current item</var> is compared to <var>value</var> (that is, how many times <img class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/current-item=value.png" alt="(current item) = (value)" title="(current item) = (value)" /> is called).
