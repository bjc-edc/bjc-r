        <h2>Copyright</h2>
        
 		<div class="learn">
        	<p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will learn about copyright: its history, what kinds of copying are legal or illegal, how technology has changed copyright issues, and how copyright is enforced with software.</p>
        	<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will discuss and reflect on your own opinions about copying other people's creative work.</p>
        </div>
     
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Do a show-of-hands survey of the class:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who has music on their phone or computer that they didn't pay for (or download from a legitimate free distributor)?</li>
                        <li>Who has movies on their phone or computer that they didn't get legally?</li>
                        <li>Who has games on their phone or computer that they didn't get legally?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now a different kind of question:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who thinks it's okay to steal music?</li>
                        <li>Who thinks it's okay to steal movies?</li>
                        <li>Who thinks it's okay to steal games?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <img class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair.png" alt="Talk with Another Pair" title="Talk with Another Pair" />
                <li>If your class is like most classes, the first set of questions got very different responses from the second set.  Discuss in small groups: Is it &quot;stealing&quot; to download artistic works without permission? Why or why not?</li>
            	<li>Discuss in small groups:  Suppose anyone were allowed to download any music, movies, etc., they want.  How could the artists (musicians, writers, producers, actors, and so on) support themselves?</li>
        		<div class="takeNote">
                    <div class="comment">IOC-1.F.1</div>
                    The <em>copyright</em> law makes it illegal for anyone to make copies of someone else's work (a book, a painting, a song, etc.) without the permission of the author. There are exceptions, as you'll learn later in this lab.
                </div>
                <li>Write out your opinion on some of these copyright issues. How well does your own behavior match what you think society should do?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="comment">IOC-1.F.4, IOC-1.F.6</div>
		<p>Copyright violation is very different from <em>plagiarism,</em> which means <em>pretending that you wrote</em> someone else's work.  You can illegally copy someone's work but say it's theirs (copyright violation), or you can copy something that isn't protected by copyright because it was written a long time ago, and pretend it's yours (plagiarism).  They're both illegal.  Copyright is complicated, but it's easy to avoid plagiarism: Just give credit to whoever wrote the stuff you want to copy.</p>
