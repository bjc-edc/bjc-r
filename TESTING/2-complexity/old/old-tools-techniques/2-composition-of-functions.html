                Debugging can be a pain. Here are some tips for writing code without (or with fewer) bugs:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Start Small</strong>: Build one (small) part of your program and get it working right before moving on to the next piece.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep it Working</strong>: When you build the next piece, get that new piece working before you move on again.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>This approach is nice because you won't have a huge mess with many bugs to sort out and you'll have something that works to share with your teacher and other programmers at every step of the way.</p>

                    It is useful to have a <code>max</code> block <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/max.png" alt="max of (), ()" title="max of (), ()" /> that takes two numbers as input and reports whichever is bigger (the maximum). Four versions of <code>max</code> are shown below: two that <em>report</em> the max value and two commands that <em>say</em> the max value. One of them doesn't work quite right. Click on one of the images below to load these scripts.<br />
