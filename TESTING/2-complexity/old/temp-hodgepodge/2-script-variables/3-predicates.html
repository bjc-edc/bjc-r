                <li>MF: I guess, overall, I'm missing a sense of where I'm going and why I'm doing this as a reader. I feel like I'm just reading "you'll use this later" content and doing lots of little tasks. <strong>PG: AGREED. REVISION NOTES</strong> This is useful practice, but feels arbitrary here. Create separate lab (as noted earlier) on analyzing and debugging, using content from U2L2.3 and U2L2.4 and any other leftover "analysis and debugging" content.</li>
                <li>MF: Our students might not be familiar with factorials and may not be solid enough with algebra to be confident with the presentation of 2a.</li>
                <li>GitHub Feedback: It would be helpful in yellow text to know how to export the "between block" we created in U2L2 Mathematical tools. Currently I am just going to recreate it in U2L3 because I am just getting a bunch of text when I tried to "export block". Thanks.</li>

        <h2>Building a Useful Collection of Predicates</h2>
        <p>Some tests—for example, a test to see if a number is even or if a letter is a vowel—are needed so often that you won't want to re-create them each time you need them. In this activity, you will create a set of tools that you may use often, especially for complicated programming tasks.  </p>
		<p>
        You've already built a predicate <code>vowel?</code> to test for vowels and a predicate to test for even numbers.  <span class="snap">snap</span> has a built-in test to see if something is a number, but not a test to see if the number is an integer, and often you will want that.</p>

                <li>
                    <span class="snap">snap</span> has a "greater than" operator (<code>&gt;</code>), an "equal" operator (<code>=</code>), and a "less than" operator (<code>&lt;</code>) built in, but doesn't have a "greater than or equal to" (<code>&gt;=</code>) operator.

                                <li>To set the block's name <code>&gt;=</code>  between the two input slots, use the left plus sign in the Block Editor. <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/left-plus-sign.png" alt="left plus sign"></li>

                                    You may find one or more of these Boolean operators helpful:

                        </div>
                    <p>There are several correct ways to do this! As long as your block gives the right <code> true</code> and <code> false</code> answers, it's correct.</p>

                <div class="takeNote">Operators like   <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/a-times-b.png"  alt="a times b"> that stand in between their two inputs are called <em><u>in</u>fix</em> operators. Operators like <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/sqrt-of-120x28.png" alt="sqrt of"> that stand before their inputs are called <em><u>pre</u>fix</em> operators. When we write <em>n</em>! to mean "<em>n</em> factorial," the "!" is a <em><u>post</u>fix</em> operator&mdash;it comes after its input <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/postfix factorial 47&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;27 pixels.png" alt="n factorial"> In <span class="snap">snap</span>, it is possible to mix the types, as you will do in the next problem.</div>

                    Build a block that tells whether a given number is between two other given numbers.

                <li>Write a <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/weekday.png" alt="weekday?"> block. You could write this  without your <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/weekend.png" alt="weekend?"> block, but it'll be much easier (and cleaner code!) if you use <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/weekend.png" alt="weekend?"> as part of this new block.</li>
