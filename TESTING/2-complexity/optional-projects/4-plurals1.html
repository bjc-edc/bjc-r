		<h2>Modeling Language: Plurals, Part 1</h2>
        <div class="todo">
            <p>PG: This /has/ a learning purpose. It's lost in "optional." The learning purpose is couched in machine generation of language, but the content/programming goals are also practice of old, learning new, and foreshadowing. The important "new" is the essential element of problem decomposition and abstraction: this problem is too difficult /without/ decomposing it, but perfectly tractable /with/ decomposition. And then, perfectly extensible to Spanish or...</p>
            <p>Brian and Mary are considering possibly one day making these two pages into a non optional lab before or after Lab 4. --MF, 1/2/21</p>

            Siri and other robots are programmed to generate language. Siri speaks; some robots write. You have developed a program, <code>gossip</code>, that writes. <b>In this project,</b> you will extend the computer's abilities with language by developing a reporter block, <code>plural</code>, that takes a noun as input and correctly spells and outputs the plural <br />

                    To do this project, you will need to use the new blocks <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/last-letter-of-169x27.png" alt="last letter of ()" title="last letter of ()" />, and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/all-but-last-letter-of-231x27 pixels.png" alt="all but last letter of ()" title="all but last letter of ()" />. You will also need <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/(list-of-items)-contains-(some-item)-predicate.png" alt="(list () () () ()) contains ()" title="(list () () () ()) contains ()"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/join-117x27.png" alt="join () ()" title="join () ()" />, which you used in Unit 1 Lab 2, Gossip and Greet.<br />

                    Try all its expressions (the nine one-line scripts) and experiment with their inputs until you are sure you understand what they do. For each expression,  say what that script does <em>in general</em> not just what it does with this particular input. (Example: <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/last-letter-of-butterfly-with-result-y.png" alt="last letter of (butterfly) reporting 'y'" title="last letter of (butterfly) reporting 'y'" > reports "y", but you want to say what <code>last letter of</code> will report if, say, "2017" is its input.)

                <li>Here's one way to start building the <code>plural</code> block. Build this much and test it out on at least "day" and "boss" and "medicine," to make sure it works correctly for those. If it does not, edit and fix it. <br /> <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/plural-(script).png"  alt="plural (word) {
    if (s = last letter of (word)) {
        report (join (word) ('two letters: es'))
    }
    report (join (word) ('one letters: s'))
}" title="plural (word) {
    if (s = last letter of (word)) {
        report (join (word) ('two letters: es'))
    }
    report (join (word) ('one letters: s'))
}" /></li>                
                <li><strong>Debugging: </strong> Try to find words for which this version of <code>plural</code> does <em>not</em>  work correctly. List  the words you find. <em>Organize that list</em>, sorting the words into categories according to their last letter. For example, it will get wrong some words that end with the letter "h". Try to find many words it gets wrong. </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><em>Save your list.</em></strong> 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a Snap<em>!</em> list like this   <img src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/noun-list-for-testing-plural2.png"  alt="a list block containing: day, boss, moth, box, butterfly, brush... (the end of the image is cut off)" title="a list block containing: day, boss, moth, box, butterfly, brush...

                <li> 
                    Your <code>plural</code> block should now work correctly for "day" and "boss" and "moth," but it probably doesn't yet work correctly for the word "box":<br />

                    Edit your <code>plural</code> block to make it work for words that end with "x". <em>Test</em> it to make sure it does work properly. <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-mini.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work" />

        <p>You can do the same for conjugating verbs in Spanish or some other language you choose. See the Take It Further section at the bottom.</p>
        <p>The next two steps are worth learning—very useful for <em>testing</em> <code>plural</code> and in more advanced work later on—but not essential for <em>building</em> <code>plural</code>.</p>

                    For now, don't worry about the words it still gets wrong, as long as it  works for "day," "boss," "moth," and "box."

                    to see what they do. Again, leave the slot in <code>last letter of</code> <em>empty</em>, as you see here. That is the placeholder for <code>keep</code> to test each word the list. Explain what the <code>keep</code> block does.
