        <h2><code>Keep</code>ing Items from a List</h2>
        <div class="learn">
			<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will use predicates with the <code>keep</code> block to keep items in a list that have specific characteristics.</p>
		</div>

		<p>As you know, predicates can be used with conditionals to decide <em>when</em> to <em>do</em> something; they can also be used with <code>keep</code> to decide <em>which</em> things to keep. The <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/keep.png" alt="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" title="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" /> block takes a list and a predicate as input, and it reports a new list keeping only the items from the input list that make the condition described by the predicate true.</p>
		
        <p>
            For example, the following expression will find words from the <var>words list</var> whose first letter is v. The <em>blank input slot</em> is where each item of the list goes to decide if it will be kept.<br>
			<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/keep-example-6.png" alt="keep items  ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)" title="keep items  ((letter(1) of ( )) = (v)) from (words list)">

                <div class="comment">AAP-1.C.4</div>
                <li>A <strong>string</strong> is an ordered sequence of characters.</li>

The same word is used for the position of a character in a string (for example, a letter in a word). So the first input to <code>letter</code> is the index.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="takeNote">
            <p><strong>You write the predicate that does the checking, and <code>keep</code> applies the predicate to each item in the input list and then reports the list of items that make your predicate <code>true</code></strong>.</p>
			<p>Note that the blank input slot in the predicate is <em>required</em>; this is where each item from the list goes as it is checked by the predicate.</p>
            <div class="endnote">The <code>letter</code> block in the palette looks like <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/letter-1-of-world.png" alt="letter (1) of (world)" title="letter (1) of (world)" />.  You have to delete the "world" so that there is a blank slot where you need it to be.</div>

        <p>The first example keeps inputs of a certain <em>length</em>; every word in the list is asked whether its length is 5, and only those with five letters are reported. The second example keeps inputs that are <em>not numbers</em>; every item in this list is asked "Is this item <em>not</em> a number?" and only the elements that are not numbers are reported.</p>
        <p>There are two <code>length</code> blocks in Snap<em>!</em>. One (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/length-of-blank-operator.png" alt="length ()" title="length ()" />) is designed for strings, and the other (<img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/length-list.png" alt="length ()" title="length ()" />) is designed for lists.</p>
