            <p>PG: This is entirely a TIF for the earlier tree thing. Scrap the "search for images" part (or make /that/ a ITIT), and put this in earlier. It is not a "project." </p>
            <p>I suggest mering all of this with "Vary Your Tree" in Lab 1 and making the combined page an optional project. --MF, 4/3/19</p>

        <p>The computer-generated landscapes and clouds you see in Pixar (and other) films are fractals. Now that you've made some fractal structures yourself, check out those found in nature.</p>

              In nature, gravity affects how plants grow. Here is an example of the tree fractal that uses a <code>gravity</code> block to weigh down the branches  roughly the way gravity would. This tree's branching structure looks like <img src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tree-with-bent-trunk.png"  height="165" alt="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge" title="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge">. The image below shows what happens when we add gravity. Experiment with this idea or work on whatever alternative you find interesting and beautiful.<br />
