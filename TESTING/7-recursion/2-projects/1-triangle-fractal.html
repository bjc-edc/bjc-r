        <div class="learn">
           <p><strong>In this lab,</strong> you will create several recursive, fractal-drawing procedures.</p>
            <!--<p><strong>On this page,</strong>...</p>-->
        </div>   
        
        <div class="sidenote">This shape is called a "<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Sierpinski+gasket&iax=1&ia=images" target="_blank">Sierpinski (sher-PIN-ski) gasket</a>." </div>

        </p>
        
        <div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
            <ol>
                <li>Open your project "U3L1-FractalArt"; save it as "U7L2-TriangleFractal".</li>
                <li>Run <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/old-nested-triangle.png" alt="nested triangle, size: (175)" title="nested triange, size: (175)" />.  Then look inside the block and remind yourself and your partner how it works.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Predict</strong> how the shape will change if you change the 9 in <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/size-gt-9.png" alt="(size)&gt;(9)" title="(size)>&gt;(9)" /> to 2 and run the instruction again. Then try it and see if it does what you expect.
                    <div class="endnote">
                        The <code>warp</code> block (in the yellow Control palette) makes the script inside it run faster by not letting any other scripts run or updating the display until it's finished.<br />
                        <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/warped-175.png" alt="warp{nested triangle, size:(175)}" title="warp{nested triangle, size:(175)}" />
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>Then set the value from 2 back to 9.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>The expression <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/size-gt-9.png" alt="(size)>(9)" title="(size)>(9)" /> sets the <em>base case</em> of the recursion in the <code>nested triangle</code> block.  But using the <var>size</var> input to control the depth of the recursion isn't very satisfactory.  For example, when you tried <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/old-nested-triangle.png" alt="nested triangle, size: (175)" title="nested triangle, size: (175)" /> you may have thought, "That's an interesting picture, but it's too big to fit on the stage.  Let me try size 100 instead."  If you actually tried it, were you disappointed in the result?</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="5">
                <li>If you didn't try it then, try it now.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>You already know a better way to control the recursion: have another input, <var>level</var>, to control the depth of the recursion separately from the overall size of the picture.  That's what you did in the tree fractal.</p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="6">
                <li>Make a block <img class="noshadow" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/tri-fract-block.png" alt="triangle fractal, level: ( ) size: ()" title="triangle fractal, level: ( ) size: ()" />.  You can use the code of your existing <code>nested triangle</code> block as a starting point.</li>
                <li>Try several <code>triangle fractal</code> drawings, all with <var>size</var> 100, but with values of <var>level</var> from 1 up to 10.  Make sure they do what you expected.</li>
                <li>
                    Generalize your procedure by adding an input:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/7-recursion/poly-fract.png" alt="polygon fractal, level: ( ) number of sides: ( ) size: ()" title="polygon fractal, level: ( ) number of sides: ( ) size: ()" />.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
