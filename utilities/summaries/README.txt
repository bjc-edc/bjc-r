1. Open a Terminal window.

2. cd to the root of your repo, so
      cd Documents/Github/bjc-r
or something like that.
Or maybe it'll be
      cd /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/bjc-r

3.    cd cur/programming/summaries

4.    ./make-summaries.sh

Done!

* This code belongs in `bjc-r/utiltities`
* Running on a Unit should put the files in the unit's directory
    * each file should have the same name, but live in a different directory
